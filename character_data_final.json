So with that we can assume that while Baekho may have been more physically stronger, have higher attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Gapryong Kim, Gapryong Kim would still win the fight as he has every other stat going for him and Baekho would never have fought him. Also in chapter 456 it is shown that the strongman Jaesoo Noh who could kill boars with one ax swing with his forearm regretting and wishing hell for his luck that he got stuck with fighting with \"Not fighting just anyone but Baekho Kwon's son\", indicating how much of a monster in terms of strength Baekho Kwon was.",

He is an immigrant worker from Thailand resigned to working many degrading jobs in order to pay off his debt and provide for his family back home. However, at the same time, Brekdak is a Muay Thai champion with a highly decorated record whom retired after killing an opponent in the ring.

Throughout the series, he is forced to wear a variety of clothing ranging from stereotypical Vietnamese attire to stylish clothing.\nHowever, Brekdak without a shirt is revealed to possess highly developed musculature, notably having a very wide back.",
        "personality": "Brekdak is a kind, unassuming man with a hard-working personality and distaste towards violence if it can be avoided. He is notably motivated primarily by his family and love of Muay Thai in all his endeavours, going so far as to allow himself to be degraded on a daily basis in order to earn money to support his family.",

His prowess is such that he is not only acknowledged by\nGun\n, but has Gun as his fan.\nDue to his tutelage of Vasco, it can be assumed that all of Vasco's current techniques is comparable or even inferior to Brekdak's with many of Brekdak's personal and \"Forbidden Techniques\" being among the more powerful techniques in Lookism.",

The students were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department and join the first generation of Burn Knuckles. Since then, underclassmen have also joined to form the second generation of Burn Knuckles.\nThe purpose of the Burn Knuckles is to protect. Vasco believes that power exists to protect the weak. The Burn Knuckles abide by that principle strictly, and are very loyal to Vasco. They will not fight unless he gives the order to. Their strength and loyalty has led some characters like\nDaniel\nto compare Burn Knuckles to the four crews, but\nJace\ndisagrees with this comparison, stating that the Burn Knuckles are only friends of Vasco and nothing more.\nThe Burn Knuckles' location in Central Seoul has led to the four crews being hesitant to establish main operations there. However, this has not stopped gangs like\nBig Deal\nand\nGod Dog\nfrom attempting to take over Central Seoul. In the God Dog Arc, Vasco swore to help Daniel defeat the four crews alongside him. Since then, the Burn Knuckles have been antagonistic towards the four crews.",

These four crews are commanded by five dangerous individuals, whose fighting skills are known to be high.\nCurrently, there are rumors that these crews were unified through a man who was recently released from prison:\nJinrang\n.",

Each of these areas is organized by a specific crew, with each crew having someone as its head.\nIn total, there are 5 heads for the 4 areas, with Area 1 having one more head. It is possible to determine the head of that area by means of a silver ring with the symbol of Busan that they are often wearing.\nIn the case of Jinrang, who recently became the leader of these unified crews, he wears a golden ring with the symbol of Busan.\nArea 1\nArea 1 is widely known for its \"roombar\" business. A roombar is an adult entertainment establishment where customers can pay to drink and chat in private rooms with hostesses.\nThis business is managed by\nArin Shin\nand\nJihoon Min\n. Currently, Area 1 is facing problems with the emergence of a karaoke bar in the area, managed by\nHudson Ahn\nand owned by\nAnsan Public\n.\nArea 2\nIn Area 2, there are several pubs, pubs that have several tables to play the game of \"hold 'em\" poker. Even though pubs with these games are legal, bars are not, and this is what they do away from the spotlight: several bars that play poker illegally, due to the clarification of the rules, apparently they also offer some in-house system in these bars to help players to continue betting.\nIts head is\nHyukjin Park\n.\nArea 3\nArea 3 is directly connected to Busan ports. There, they smuggle young foreign girls, this business is the one that generates the most money among all the Four Big Groups in Busan.\nHis methods are brutal and cruel, he smuggles young girls by hiding them on ships. When the police are about to catch them, they hide the crime by sinking the ship, along with the smuggled girls in the cold ocean.\nIts head is\nSangjin Hyun\n.\nArea 4\nArea 4 has a more direct business: clandestine fights. Initially the place was used to resolve disputes between sailors, but it ended up becoming more and more popular, to the point where most people in the region know about the Arena.\nIt is implied that there are several categories of fights in the Arena, such as fights with bladed weapons or bare hands. Fights are normally carried out one-on-one, with no rules or restrictions on techniques to be used against the opponent. The people watching then choose a fighter that they think will be the winner, and then bet on him, thus, the winnings go to the fighter, and possibly part also goes to whoever is organizing the fight, thus sustaining the Area's business.\nIts head is\nJinchan Kang\n, who is also the Arena champion."

Crystal Choi is the daughter of the HNH Group chairman, Charles Choi. She is the heiress of HNH Group and CEO of Crystal TV. She is also a member of the Ten Geniuses. Bae Jeong-mi voices Crystal in the Lookism animated series.",
        "appearance": "Original Body In her original \"attractive\" body, Crystal possesses unrivaled beauty within the series and this, coupled with her status as the HNH chairman's daughter, is usually enough to mark her reputation and status of importance as well above others. Even Aru Lee, a famous idol star, couldn't help but feel jealousy towards the difference in their status as DG diligently attended to Crystal's every need, yet wouldn't even bat an eye for Aru. Crystal is also fairly tall in this body, with a curvy physique. Ever since Crystal drastically transformed from her past overweight self, she became the sexiest, hottest and most gorgeous girl in the country. So immensely beautiful and attractive that she could have any guy in the country if she wanted. Crystal keeping track of her unhealthy diet. In Chapter 60, Crystal recounts her journey from feeling overlooked and unattractive due to her weight and says that she could never imagine being treated with kindness and admiration in the past as she experiences them when she drastically changes and becomes very attractive. This shift has left her skeptical of people's motives when they treat her humanely and kindly. She reveals the extreme lengths she went to in order to transform herself citing that she \u201calmost killed herself to change\u201d, admitting to contemplating drastic measures. Her meticulous tracking of calorie intake and strict adherence to a potentially unhealthy diet regimen underscore the lengths she goes to maintain her current appearance. Crystal wishes she didn\u2019t have to endure a hellish life all over again as she ventures on to keep an eye on Daniel through her alternate, unattractive body, as per her father\u2019s orders. Crystal has an immensely good fashion sense, in direct contrast with Daniel, who has terrible fashion sense and only maintains his stunningly fashionable looks with the help of Jay Hong. Crystal is very knowledgeable in fashion, even schooling Daniel when she was annoyed at his poor fashion sense despite him being in the fashion department. Crystal seems to prefer dressing in style while in her original attractive body, which may be why she assumed Park Daniel did the same as well (when she was suspicious of him having two bodies). She generally uses this body to attend business related events and issues. She works out quite a lot to maintain this body rather than the unattractive body which indicates that this is her real body. Alternate Body In her \u201cunattractive\u201d alternate body, Crystal is strikingly similar to Daniel Park in his original body (before he lost weight), to the point that it's as if she was the female version of him. Crystal is obese and quite short in this form, approximately the same height as Daniel in the past. Much like Daniel, she is also referred to as 'Pig' by many people due to her size and height; usually girls who are jealous of her getting attention from Daniel in his second body. Crystal recounts her exhaustive efforts to alter her physical appearance in this body through all sorts of diets and workout regimens. She was unsuccessful at losing even a bit of weight, henceforth implying that this her alternate body. She has been shown to have a prowess in fighting while in this body as well, as she is seen beating up some bullies during the Picnic Arc in Chapter 144. She has also used the two body system to cheat on exams to get high marks; however, unlike Daniel, she seems to have no shame in using it this way. This could be due to the influence of her father, who shames Daniel for wasting his \"gift\". Crystal mostly uses this body for school related events and issues to keep watch of Daniel.",
        "personality": "Crystal's views of men around her. Irrespective of what form she is in, Crystal harbors a prejudice towards attractive people, mostly due to how people used to treat her in her past when she was \u201cunattractive\u201d and overweight. She faces the same treatment in her alternate \u201cunattractive\u201d body (that she cannot change since it\u2019s her second body) often being called her derogatory terms, being ostracized and bullied. She developed a cynical outlook towards attractive people, due to how many times she has been humiliated by their fake kindness towards her Unattractive Body. This cynical outlook isn't just exclusive towards attractive people, it also extends towards all people in general\u2014this is because Crystal is the daughter of Charles Choi, and as his daughter, Crystal has a lot of suitors due to her power and looks. As a result, she tends to generalize attractive people to be egotistical, and believe people to be shallow and superficial. This belief and experiences led Crystal to close off her heart, finding comfort in being alone and genuinely not wanting to rely on other people. This belief also led to her initial distrust of Daniel, initially responding to his friendly actions with caution and politeness, and pushing him away from her because his presence and compassion towards her Unattractive Body at school is causing other girls to bully her. Despite Crystal's prejudices and cynical outlook towards other people, she is a kind person at heart. She feeds and take care of Enu regularly alongside Daniel. She also helped them during the Illegal Toto Arc using her Attractive Body which surprised Kouji, stating that she had never bothered to help others before. Crystal is slowly but surely maturing as she interacts more with Daniel and his clique and becoming less and less prejudiced.",
        "relationships": "Family Charles Choi Charles is her father and he is the only one who knows the fact she has two bodies. He also ordered her to keep an eye on Daniel, because he knows Daniel has two bodies as well. As shown, despite caring for her father, Crystal was not blind to his faults and of how selfish and evil he was. This was shown during his funeral, where Crystal acknowledged that even though her father had so many working under him and had met so many people in his life, no one bothered to go to his funeral. A fact that Crystal found both heartbreaking, but fair, as he had hurt, used and abused so many people during his life and earned the justified hatred of many as well. Friends Kouji Kouji and Crystal know each other well because Kouji is one of the ten people who were raised by Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. These ten special children are considered prodigies under his care. Even though the two know each other substantially well, they hardly meet unless Crystal needs Kouji's assistance in an emergency or any similar matter. Their relationship is based on money as he will only do her bidding if he makes a profit off of the work. DG DG and Crystal are close acquaintances and know each other quite well because of Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. His friendship with Crystal surprises many girls since he doesn't show any obvious kindliness to any other girl. Despite being very close to each other, DG and Crystal have no romance in their relationship.",
        "background": "As the daughter of the HNH Group Chairman, Charles Choi, Crystal comes from a very wealthy background. However this was not always the case. Crystal seems to have grown up poor for majority of her life, before her father made his business successful. This is implied when she tells Daniel that she used to live under similar conditions as him, as well as looking into her father's own background. She is one of the few raised by the chairman of HNH Group, Charles Choi, as well as the only legitimate child and daughter. Crystal (much like Daniel) also has two bodies. At some point, her father tasked her with keeping an eye on Daniel, which is why she transferred to Jae Won High in her alternate body while her original body is usually attending to her other issues after dusk, usually tending to business related issues.",
        "fighting_prowess": "As Charles Choi\u2019s daughter and under the protection of the likes of Jong Gun and previously Goo Kim, she does not have to fight very often, even though she has shown to be quite formidable in her own right. Gun, the training genius, has undertook her training. Although Crystal seems well versed in all sorts of martial arts-even showcasing Kyokushin Karate, Boxing as well as Aikido, and how she seems to quickly identify Eli Jang's moves and tries to find any correlation to the many martial arts she knows, it seems that she has only ever used and possibly learnt it for the sake of self-defence, which is the reason we are yet to see the extent of her full capabilities in combat. However as she carries the blood of Charles Choi, or Elite, the Second-in-Command or the Underboss of Gapryong Kim\u2019s Fist Gang in the Pre-Generation, she seems to have potential by her superior genes. Original Body Crystal using Gun's Aikido on Matt Kang. At some point, Crystal was trained by Jong Gun on how to fight and is fully capable of taking care of herself. The extent of her ability in combat has yet to be explored as she rarely ever has to fight in this body, but since she was trained by a legendary fighter it can be assumed she is a formidable fighter in her own right. Crystal first fought when she beat and kicked Daniel\u2019s stalker using Jong Gun\u2019s training in the Stalker arc in Chapter 120. Crystal was able to knock Daniel\u2019s stalker who was wielding a taser, using a Kyokushin Karate kick. Crystal has also showed enough strength to skillfully knock out Matt Kang, the boss of a small crew based in Cheonliang, for bothering her friends and herself, using the Corkscrew Blow and Gun\u2019s Aikido move, during the Hostel Branch arc in Chapter 258. Alternate Body Despite the hinderance of the height and weight of her alternative body, she is capable of doing jump kicks and was shown beating up three bullies in a bathroom for bothering Zoe, Mira and Yui during the Picnic arc in Chapter 144.",

He feels no empathy for Johan, despite knowing his tragic reality, even smiling sadistically at manipulating his mother. He was also willing to cut off his hands and feet and locking him in his dog house. He is also very perverted, seeing as he stalked then later attempted to rape Mira, a middle schooler.

He fed off their insecurities and promised them salvation if he listened to his every word, because he was their 'messiah'. He used drugs (which he likely brought from Vivi or her affiliates from Workers 3rd Affiliate) to make them susceptible to his influence. He trained his followers to worship dogs, which he controlled using scented liquids. If his followers disobeyed him they were either tortured or killed. The cult leader tries to get Johan's mother to join his cult but she stopped when she realized her son was in danger. He attempted to stone her to death but Johan saved his mother.

His original body used to be short and overweight, now he's a lot more handsome, tall and muscular, and his second body is of tall height, thin and handsome and stated to be the perfect body.\n\nFirst Body\nIn his original body, Daniel is usually bespectacled, and short to the point only\nDuke Pyeon\nand\nCrystal Choi\n's original body near his height. Daniel is extremely overweight, which is why Logan calls him \"Pikachu\" (Dog in the anime).\nDaniel's first body is deemed unattractive by most, if not all, the exceptions being Crystal and Zoe. In this body, he's exposed to the true nature of society. Daniel uses this body at night to work part-time at a local mini mart, which is why it's usually seen in his work uniform.\nDespite the difference in weight and height, his first body gradually begins to resemble his second. After his fight with\nLogan Lee\nand the incident involving the homeless man who broke his glasses, Daniel's face is more striking, and he's noticeably taller and slimmer, measuring up slightly taller than\nZoe\nin height. After intense dieting and training with Sophia, he loses over a hundred pounds, so his original body is practically identical to his second body, though it is shorter. After Gun's training, Daniel has grown very tall; nearing his second body in height. Daniel has also put on more muscle mass, making him look more defined, he looks really similar to his second body in chapter (424). His face looks quite identical to the second body as well. It was stated that he resembles a younger Jinyoung Park, and even his grandmother confused him as Jinyoung Park.\n\nSecond Body\nDaniel Park first see's his second body\nIn his second body, Daniel has no glasses and he's taller. He has a healthy, athletic build and more physically attractive. This being his most notable trait, usually leaving women infatuated and men intimidated. Daniel's good looks make people think he is a famous model, idol, or star (which he eventually becomes) as they go so far as to ask for his autographs and pictures with him, much to his shock.\nNo one has ever been stated to surpass Daniel's good looks, and no one retains the center of attention as he does (albeit unintentionally), as a result, his second body is the most popular student at J High. He uses this body to attend school and it's usually seen in his school uniform, unless elsewhere.",
        "personality": "Daniel is a very kind and friendly person at heart, preferring to avoid unnecessary conflicts if he can, but will help those in need even in dangerous situations.\nInitially, due to being bullied, Daniel would take out his anger on his mom. However, he began to realize just how much she sacrificed for his sake, filling him with deep feelings of self-loathing and regret for his actions towards his mother to the point of vowing to be a better person. He often cries whenever he is reminded of how he treated her, such as when in his second body, he was asked to act out a certain role as a test to see his acting skills only for Daniel to cry while reading the script as the part was similar to a part of his life, he regretted the most. So as to not trouble his mother financially, Daniel is very humble and responsible as he does not bother with materialistic things unless they cut down on his or his mom's living expenses (e.g., rice cooker) and is willing to work so he can pay his own living expenses.\nDaniel is also very sympathetic and protective of those mistreated, either because of their lack of strength or because of how unattractive they are, as he can relate to how both feel and is prone to stand up for them. Though it is implied in the Runaway fam arc he is respectful enough to not interfere in other affairs without permission.\nLack of self-confidence is often Daniel's biggest hindrance slowing his progress on his goal of trying to be a better person. In some cases, it leads to his being perceived as a pushover who is nothing but a coward. Fortunately, Daniel is constantly inspired by those who diligently work towards their goals, such as Euntae and Duke and is motivated to put more effort into overcoming his struggles to achieve his goals.\nDue to his lack of social interaction with people around him prior to having his second body, he can be naive, much like Euntae, and is unsure how to act when placed under peer pressure. Likewise, he is easily deceived by perceived kindness. For example, he once accidentally agreed to become a host in a club and escaped the club while drunk. Moreover, he thought that Yui genuinely liked him for who he is while in his second body but was shocked when she treated him cruelly while he was in his original body. He also never smoked or intentionally drank before and didn't know how to refuse when putting under pressure to do so. However, this tends to create humorous situations and misunderstandings about him.\nAfter temporarily losing his connection with his current body and being helplessly bullied by Logan Daniel regressed back into his old self before moving to Seoul. But after realizing that this world wasn't fair and how he needs to work harder to overcome that unfairness Daniel gets a way better appreciation for his old body and becomes more confident in it.\nDaniel tends to become belligerent, overconfident, and apologetic when drunk.\nIn later arcs he is seen to also have an aggressive personality when in a tense battle.",
        "history": "Daniel was raised by a single mom, and they lived in poverty. In addition to his poor living conditions, Daniel was looked down upon due to his appearance, leading him to be bullied at school (mostly by Logan). No longer willing to put up with the bullying, Daniel's mother offered him a chance to transfer to a different school (Jae Won High). Daniel, unable to bear with his school troubles any longer, tearfully accepted.\nUpon moving, Daniel's dreams of starting anew were quickly shattered by a humiliating defeat at the hands of\nZack Lee\n, captured on video. With the video going viral, he cried himself to sleep only to awaken the next morning in a completely new body. He discovered the following rules:\nHe has to sleep to change bodies\nIf one body is forcefully awakened, the other body will go to sleep.\nThe sleeping body has to be cared for like an actual body.\nHe is conscious at all times (cannot have dreams).\nIn a state of lost consciousness, he cannot change bodies until the other body recovers consciousness.\nThe sleeping body experiences all physiological phenomena normal bodies do.",

Regardless of which body he is in, Daniel can memorize any technique down to its textbook mechanics after seeing it once and execute it with the same amount of competency as a skilled expert. In addition to this skill, he possesses incredible foresight in a fight, able to clearly see all attacks his opponents throw at him. Whether or not he is able to dodge the said attacks usually depends on his opponent and Daniel's current body. Daniels' ability to copy other people's techniques is so amazing that to others who fought Daniel felt like they were fighting themselves. Later on it was stated that Daniel\u2019s ability to copy others Techniques were far superior to Johan Seong(Another copy cat genius) stating that Johan only imitates others while Daniel is the real deal (which correlates with him being as competent as a Skilled master in that martial art or field) In the more recent chapters whenever he copies a character his hair or physical appearance turns similar to them.Further his fighting senses were so accute that he was able to catch Gun (while in trainning) and DJ offguard while fighting them which proved his calm and levelheaded attitude even in strenuous situations. According to Gun, Daniel has the eyes to figure out his out his opponent, but he isnt able to use it to its full strength. If he focuses, he can see more. During Busan arc his copy ability in second body further developed and he could copy others move effortlessly but during his fight with Jinrang when he copied the moves of his opponent along with the techniques and moves of other kings he could copy them easily but couldn't genrate the same power .Jinrang mentioned that he could copy the moves but he could never copy the intents or its force due to not understanding its significance and hardwork required to develop them thus the power of those techniques were weak.\n\nOriginal Body\nDaniel's old body\nWhile not on par with his second body, his weight does add an incredible amount momentum to his attacks unleashing them with such surprising force that he even forced Euntae (who possesses unbelievable strength) to resort to knocking him out when he felt he could no longer withstand his punches. He rarely ever fights in this body due to his lack of confidence while using it, but as the series progresses, he does become a more capable fighter, especially under\nVasco\n's strict workouts and guidance despite him not being aware of it. In this body, he severely lacks the desired reflexes he gains in his second body. Despite being able to see the attacks (even once commented on how slow they were), he was still not able to physically dodge them due to this body's lack of agility and reflexes. It should be noted that if attacks are executed by non-skilled practitioners, even in this body, he has no problems defending against them. Despite its many shortcomings Daniel's first body still has impressive strength and endurance as he managed to take and multiple hits from Logan Lee and recover from the experience with no lasting injuries. even\nchairman hong\nwas surprised that daniel took an attack from\nsophia\nand survived while most can not. With enough determination, his fat body could take out a person with little or no fighting experience.\nDaniel trained his body becoming unrecognizable to most people in this new form looking closer to his second body than his first, even\nZoe Park\nand\nLogan Lee\ndid not recognize him as the transformation was extreme. The weaknesses his body had are now gone as his body is faster with the addition of Systema. he has high tolerance to drugs that the drugs that were in the cookies were ineffective. Later on, he is trained by Gun as a potential successor, making him a far more fearsome fighter, he is shown to easily beat a Workers Executive and even throw Xiaolung, who is known for being a powerful opponent to many. He is also seen countering Yuseong's attack by blocking his fist and using the other leg to kick him into the ground. He has gotten so strong to the point where Eugene even compares him to a First Generation King.\nOriginal body after training (Episode 411)\nIn chapter 438, he was able to use \"\nSelf-Hatred\n\" mode in his Original Body just like his Second Body.\nIn chapter 439, Daniel was barely able to copy the moves of James Lee, but he was not as fast as him. Jichang praised his strength and said he understood why seokdu lost and why taesoo got fired up. This may imply Daniel was on the level of Taesoo or Seokdu.\nIn Chapter 439, Gun Taught him about Subconsciousness by choking Daniel on the neck and gains an ability to use\nUltra Instinct\nagain just like his Second Body.\nIn the current arc as of chapter 453 it is known that he can take on someone on the level of Jichang Kwak (being superior to the same only when using the Ultra Instinct), who himself is stated that brute strength wise is on par with Gun Park (stated by Daniel Park himself), and Jichang Kwak was someone that even Elite (Charles Choi) was interested in becoming his bodyguard before he took Jichang's life.\nIt is also shown in the recent chapter that Gun mentioned that Daniel's copy ability was inefficent in his old body earlier as he could not generate the same power while executing the techniques that he copied, but after his training with Gun his body became strong to such level that Gun mentioned that he could now easily imitate all the moves of Gen 1 Kings almost perfecly (including\nTaesoo Ma's Fist techniques\n).\nIn the recent chapter he copied\nKwak Jinchang's\nHand Edge Technique\nperfectly while fighting Logan Lee and pulverised him thus defeating him easily.\nWhen he used Ultra Instinct against his second body, it was stated that he and his second body was moving so fast that not even Warren could keep up. If Vasco, Warren and Jerry steped in the fight, they would die. He and his second body were using every fighting technique under they experienced so far, and given that they had the same movements and techniques, they could be mistaken as the same person. However, little Daniel was being pushed back due to the experience gap between the two bodies.\nAccording to Gun Park, His ultra instinct (along with his second body) is fundamentally different from his. With Ultra instinct, he fights efficiently by adjusting to his opponent's combat power. He is mechanical with his counterattacks by returning an attack equal to the one he received. However, he does not have control over it. Due to that , when receiving the same attack the second time, he will give the same response each time.Futher in comparison to his perfect body he was inefficient in perfecting the power of the used techniques\nGun Park mentioned that Daniel Park was his greatest masterpiece he ever created .\n\nSecond Body\nSecond body in UI mode\nIn this body, Daniel is among the strongest in the entire series. Even before he developed his technique and skill, he was able to defeat most opponents, solely relying on reflexes and instinct and is one of the few characters to naturally be on the level of skilled fighters with no prior formal training, the other being Johan. This, coupled with Daniel's ability to instantly replicate any fighting skill he sees just once, makes him one of the series' most formidable fighters by outdoing many others with their own fighting techniques.\nIt seems Daniel has become used to his abilities and immense fighting prowess in this body, able to dodge attacks merely on reflex with extreme ease, even while in deep thought. In some fights, he has found some attacks to be annoying.\nHis biggest testament to his fighting prowess is being one of the only people (the other being Euntae) that Jong Gun, a fighter of legendary status, acknowledges even once. Gun stated that, although Crystal was heading for a dangerous situation, if she is accompanied by Daniel and Euntae, then she's not in any real danger. However, he is not yet on the level of Jong Gun or Joon Goo, as he was easily defeated by Gun but in his UI state he fought a contolled UI Gun Park on equal footing in his hideout. Meanwhile, Euntae, his fighting equal, was soundly defeated by Jake Kim, who Gun promptly defeated.\nSo far Daniel's biggest weakness is that his compassion can often lead to unfair or synchronized fighters like Chuck Kwak and Justin Peng to overwhelm him. He also can't copy the determination that comes from the moves he copies, which makes opponents like Zack hard to fight.\nDaniel's last trick is when he enters a state known as \"Ultra-Instinct,\" in which he is rendered in a state between conscious and unconscious. He is able to maximize his fighting potential by utilizing every single move of his knowledge without hesitation. In this state he is so powerful that he is able to suppress Jerry Kwon and even able to break one of Gun's arms in their one-on-one fight. He was able to defeat 2 Crew Head (Jake Kim and Samuel Seo) simultaneously. He then proceeded to easily defeat Jerry Kwon and Lineman. After that, he completely dominated a raged Johan Seong in their fight. Although, he was not able to defeat Goo because he suddenly passed out, he still inflicted a huge damage on him. The downside of this state is that he is unable to control himself, making it difficult to discern between friends and foes.\nIn chapter 467, Gun has stated that Ultra Instinct was able to control (Gun Park can control UI) and the one who can control it can \"adjust\" their strength whatever they want. The one who aren't able to control UI will \"adjust\" their strength based on the opponents. For example, if the opponent is weak, UI will adjust its strength being weak for that opponent. If the opponent is strong, UI will just adjust its strength being strong for that opponent.\nWhile he and his real body had the same techniques and movements, Warren states that Big Daniel had more experience using those techniques. Its as if he has more practiced and that little daniel was simply copying him.\nIn chapter 470\nJinyoung Park\nsaid that Daniels strength is on the level of the ones whom the\nGapryong fist\nwas fighting against and he is way past the level of the 2nd and 1st generation and also said the he wanted to see Daniel and Gapryong in a fight this implies that he is around the level of\nGapryong Kim.\nAccording to DG, Daniel and Gun share ultra instinct, but their fighting styles are different (possibly due to having different bloodlines). With Ultra instinct, he is more like a cool-headed machine. He uses sophisticated techniques to maximize his efficiency like a perfect weapon.which was a flaw as even an injured Gun Park defeated him in his Ulta Instincrt staye mentioning that until he controls it he couldn't kill Gun Park.\nDruing his fight with Jangyeon Na he fought with a higher intensity owing to his training with Shiro Oni, he used his Heat mode and Yamazaki Kyokushin Karate to overpowering King of Incheon shocking him and other spectators equally.\n\nMartial Arts Copied by his Bodies and used currently:\nBoxing\nBig Daniel copying\nZack's\nboxing (Chapter 272)\nJerry\nnotes Big Daniel's form and posture are perfect (Chapter 274)\nMuay Thai\nUI Big Daniel using Muay Thai vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nBig Daniel copying\nGabriel Park\n(Chapter 295)\nKyokushin Karate\nBig Daniel using Karate vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel using Karate vs\nZack\n(Chapter 271)\nLittle Daniel using Karate vs\nYuseong\n(Chapter 425)\nTaekwondo\nBig Daniel uses Taekwondo vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nBig Daniel using the Axe Kick vs\nSamuel\nand\nJake\nSystema\nBig Daniel using Systema vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nSophia-Style Systema\nLittle Daniel using\nSophia\n's Systema vs\nXiaolong\n(Chapter 326)\nWrestling\nBig Daniel using Wrestling vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel using Wrestling vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nCapoeira\nBig Daniel uses Capoeira vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel uses Capoeira vs\nGun\ndespite never seeing it at the time (Chapter 286)\nMMA\nAs Daniel knows a lot of martial arts, he can effectively mix them.\nAikido\nLittle Daniel using Aikido on\nXiaolong\n(Chapter 424)\nLittle Daniel copies\nGun's\nAikido (Chapter 397)\nInvisible Attack (IA)\nLittle Daniel copying\nJames Lee\nvs\nJichang Kwak\n(Chapter 439)\n(While he himself doesn't have the speed for it to be truly invisible and on the level of\nSinu\n,\nJames\nand\nElite's\nwhen it comes to speed with the attack, but he has copied the concept)\nKwak Jinchang's Hand Blade Technique\nLittle Daniel copying\nJichang's\nHand Blade (Chapter 460)\nBig Daniel copying\nJichang's\nHand Blade (Chapter 544)\nInnate Strength (\nKitae Kim\n)\nBig Daniel supposedly copying what seems to be\nKitae Kim\n(Chapter 468)\nWhile watching the fight,\nWarren\nclaims that what Big Daniel is copying isn't a martial art, just Innate Strength.

He tends to watch and observe others silently, but when he talks, he acts quite aloof and distant, only warming up to a few people. DG is also very honest, but he doesn't talk much so it's sometimes difficult to know what he is thinking.\nHe is known to be extremely intelligent and talented. A hall of his trophies and awards were displayed in his previous school which is now abandoned, showing his expertise in various fields. Some of the awards includes him being a champion in art, poetry, golf, swimming, tennis, and many more.\nBack in the 1st generation, James was extremely ruthless.

Sometimes it is said he is the strongest in the verse. He single handedly took down Darius Hong and his gang with ease, showing prodigal skill in combat. It is said that he ended the\nfirst generation\n, a notorious era of well known fighters. He bested Taesoo Ma, the \"King Of Ansan\" in a fight with little to no injuries. He fights using an acrobatic style , and being incredibly quick and swift, to dodge other's attacks. His fighting style is described to be very graceful. He is also one of three users able to use\nInvisible Attacks\n, where one attacks the blindspots of an opponent so quickly, the attack seems invisible to the eye.\nIn chapter 428, he fought the J High trio and says that he will spare Big Deal and Burn Knuckles if they manage to land a single clean hit on him. Over the course of the fight, he overpowered the trio with little to no effort while keeping his left hand in his pocket.\nIn the past, James had managed to defeat and disband the\nGeneration of Circles\n(1st Gen) all by himself, and take a body part of the regional kings he had defeated, such as Taesoo's eye and Gongseob Ji's leg (with some\nexceptions\n).\nAs of chapter 463 it is shown that in the past during his fight with Gongseob Ji, James was shown an incredible technique by Gongseob called the 'Gongseob Ji Counter' where it is described to be a double edge sword as you need to have an immense desire to not fall and to win to get back up to land a devastating punch on your opponent that could potentially end the fight with your win, but it was shown that either James dodged the attack or took it head on and received no damage whatsoever. Even James wanted to learn the technique but Gongseob declined and stated he would never take on a student (which\nchanged\n) and made the stone faced sarcastic James Lee lament and sigh stating that its sad that Gongseob will have to retire and that the technique will fall with him.\nIn his fight with\nSeongji Yuk\n, he reveals that he has \"overcome the threshold\" in two areas, speed and technique, those two alone allowing him to be as legendary as he was. He also states that he isn't able to overcome another threshold because he's lacking in potential.In the later part of the battle he was able to overcome the threshold of strength against Seongji Yuk.",

This contrasts with Gun Park who has a demon motif.\nIn Episode 479, people started to believe that DG is actually Charles's second body. This speculation however has been invalid as in Episode 480, DG said he had followed Charles's action on \"kidnapping\" Baek Gyul because Charles was scared that Gyul could ask Park Jin Young about his weakness.",

He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know.\nJames Lee\nEugene\ntells Daniel the story of James Lee and the\nHistory of Fists\n. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.\nDaniel asks DG if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee. Daniel asks how DG knows about the two bodies, and DG tells him that he's known about Daniel's bodies since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.\nDG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by\nGapryong Kim\n, who was known as the \"Legendary Fist\". The crews at this time were called \"fists\", and the crew heads were called \"bosses\", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called \"circles\". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of\nCharles Choi's\ngenius\n, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.\nEugene later calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours.\nOne Night III\nDG goes off to find the James Lee crew and put an end to their misuse of his name. He comes to their headquarters and finds Backdoor members. He asks if they know about James Lee, and they decide to attack him and bring him to Darius. DG beats them all and walks away.\nDG then comes across Daniel and the J High crew fighting Taesoo Ma and interrupts them."

Here, he helped out a captive\nDaniel Park\n, disobeying Vivi's orders to pour acid on him and bumping into the security guards at the entrance, allowing Daniel to escape. This is a pivotal point towards his character development, as he desires to have a fresh start.\nDespite all this, Doo manages to avoid trouble and gets promoted to Executive in the Workers'\nSecond Affiliate\n, due to Eugene overhearing his unique ideas that could be implemented into the fighting circus. He is next seen in the\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate) arc\n, where he was known as Hannya. Here, he seems to have built up a reputation, lying about being a tough guy who's ultimate move is the \"Dragon Fist\", even being referred to by\nRyuhei\nas\n\"..the only Korean [Ryuhei] acknowledge[s]\".\nWhile initially lashing out at Daniel for not saving him, he soon reveals key information about the circus, helping Daniel create a plan to take them down.\nDoo manages to escape following the defeat of the 2nd Affiliate. Before he leaves, he has a final encounter with Ryuhei, where he confessed that everything he told him was a lie, including the \"Dragon Fist\", and he was just a bully. Ryuhei tells him to turn over a new leaf and become a Korean worthy of his respect. This is a major turning point for Doo, who decides to take his advice to heart.

But both Daniel and Zack made excuses to get themselves out of there, much to the disappointment of Doo Lee and the girls. He, along with the two cronies and the Beauty Department girls were later caught by the camp instructors and forced to do squats as punishment.\nThe next night, Doo Lee assists Daniel, Jiho, and Zoe in searching for Mira and Zack. He suggest that they might just be hanging out and will return soon, but they keep searching regardless. Along with the police, they eventually find Zack beating up\nHeemin Kim\nafter the latter attempted to rape Mira.\nAttention Whore\nDoo Lee offers\nPark Tae Joon\nto make a video with him on Pacebook, which he accepts. He then tries to offer Daniel to join him (hoping that his looks will get them views), but Zack tells him to shut up. Tired of being told what to do, Doo Lee reminds him that he spent his own money to buy things for him and that he should be thankful. Just before they're about to fight, they are separated as Doo Lee shouts that Zack has no friends, but rather underlings who do things for him.\nIn the Pacebook video Doo Lee makes with Tae Joon, they call out the gangster Shin Dae Hoon, gaining them popularity. Tae Joon worries about the possibility that Dae Hoon will respond, but Doo Lee assures that it's all going to be alright. As they make more videos targeting Dae Hoon which gets more and more attention every time, Dae Hoon finally responds after they make fun of his mom, saying that he will find and catch them, knowing that they both go to J High.\nWorkers (4th Affiliate)\nOne Night III\nWorkers (3rd Affiliate)\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)"

However, the president took one look at him and he was immediately dismissed without him being able to perform his piece. Frustrated by the unfair rejection he proceeded to take out all his emotions and turn them into lyrics. The next day in school the students in the vocal dance department were talking about the up incoming festival and discussing on who should perform Jin Ho and someone irrelevant was chosen to perform and Duke volunteered to perform as well and for that he received all kinds of back lash. While walking down the hallway he heard Daniel singing and asked him to sing with him in the festival. During their practice Daniel noticed their similarities and realized how amazing Duke was to be able to create such wonderful lyrics despite being in his situations as well as having the courage to try even after all the rejections he has received. At the start of their performance Daniel made a mistake so Duke covered for him and showed that he had his back they did really well and all the audience were surprised and Duke finally got the recognition he deserves. At the end of the performance the president of DY approached them and gave his business card and offered a job....to Daniel who humbly declined but that did not stop Duke.\nPaprika TV Arc\nAfter his 2nd rejection from DY, Duke started to perform his rap songs in Paprika.

He dreams to be a hairdresser when asked by Vasco what his dream is, this most likely have been influenced by\nHeather\n.\nEli Jang single-handedly defeats several members of the God Dogs.\nHe usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna; he did not protest even when some of the\nGod Dogs\ntreated him harshly, rather he apologized, seeking to end the argument peacefully.\nHe is very protective of his daughter Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he ever received. He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew.\nIn his past, Eli proved to be a very violent man as he grew up on the streets. He was willing to do just about anything to get what he wants. While he did display a very simple vocabulary he also showed to be very street smart given that he was able to come up with the idea of Hostel in the first place.

        "fighting_prowess": "\u201c\nI'm not fighting Eli ever again. Because it felt like I'm fighting a beast.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Warren Chae about Eli Jang's fighting style\nStreet Fighting and Savagery\nEli Jang is one of the most savage and aggressive fighters shown. His upbringing on the streets with\nMister Carpenter\ncoupled with his lack of formal martial arts training cultured fighting instincts often called \"animalistic\". He was so fearsome that Gun took him as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, comparing his fighting style to his partner Goo's. Eli's fighting style can be surmised as pure efficient savagery, utilizing any-and-all attacks to finish the fight as succinctly as possible. This includes biting, groin grabbing, eye-gouging, headbutting, fiercely stomping a grounded opponent and using any weapon he can get his hands on. Interestingly, it is noted that his fighting style is a mirror copy of Tom Lee's by employees of the White Tiger Centre. His savage fighting style gets more dangerous when Eli is cornered. He uses his opponent's clothes or accessories to restrain or to inflict great damage on them as seen when he used Warren's clothing as makeshift handcuffs\n[\n4\n]\nand when he strangled Darius with his necklace.\n[\n3\n]\nAfter meeting Eli once again, Tom Lee remarked that he isn't as strong as he expected him to be and resolved to teach him everything again from scratch in order to awaken the real beast inside him. After a month of training and getting beaten up, Tom told Eli that he awakened something called the Animal Instinct, only then Tom acknowledges Eli and gives Yenna back to him.\n[\n5\n]\nPhysical Endurance\nEli has great endurance as he was able to spring back up after being hit by powerful fighters like Warren Chae and Darius Hong. He is also quite powerful as he once knocked out Johan Seong in one swing of a flute and it is implied that after training with Gun he got much stronger giving Gun the scar on his chest when the latter decided to test him. He is strong enough to defeat\nIvan Park\nand\nHope Park\n, two fighters renowned for their physical strength, with ease.\n[\n6\n]\nAikido and Weapon Use\nThanks to Gun's training, Eli now knows Aikido as a martial art and seems to have proficiency in the usage of stun batons. Gun remarked that he gave Eli a stun baton because he is too strong, metaphorically referring to that weapon as a chain to restrain Eli. His fighting method is proven to be efficient and effective as Eli could defeat singlehandedly Hostel A's mobs and Darius for the second time.\nHunt for Big Deal arc\nIn the hunt for Big Deal arc Eli became incredibly more powerful than before so much so that some underlings in Big Deal stated that Eli was overflowing with power and that\nMandeok\nsaid that he has finally became a strong man and made up for the 3 year hiatus. This is proven even further with the fact that by this time he has played a crucial role in defeating two 1st Gen kings and taking over their territory. His endurance is so great that during the fight against\nSinu Han\neven though he was bloody and beaten he still didn't fall to the ground until\nGun\nfinished the job.",

Eli's father remarried, with the new wife beating him severely.

In either case, the new wife remarried her old husband and brought in her biological children to Eli's household.\nThe mother continued her abuse and neglect of Eli, keeping him locked away whilst the rest of the family enjoyed their new dwelling. The only memorable interaction Eli had with his family was when he played a twisted version of hide-and-seek with his mother where once the hider was found, they would be severely beaten. This game warped Eli's conception of love with him coming to enjoy the game as this was the only time his new mother would come to seek him out. The culmination of Eli's childhood was his running away at the age of 10. On the streets, he was brought up by \"Mr. Carpenter\".",

She is intrigued and asks what he is doing there, and he responds by calling her a bitch. The boy is\nEli Jang\nin the past.\nChapter 233\nSally decides to allow Eli to stay in the spur of the moment. He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then \"he will get in big trouble\".\nAt school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.\nWarren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park. He doesn't like how close she is to Eli and tries to intimidate him. Eli bites his nose and swears at him, and Sally realizes he is scared of Warren. Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.\nChapter 234\nSally tells Eli not to fight and Warren punches Eli. Sally then gets angry at Warren and tells him he is mean for hitting Eli. Warren walks away feeling hurt, but returns in the night claiming he will stay at Sally's so he can protect her. Sally protests but eventually allows him and his friends\nMax\nand\nDerrick\nto stay.\nIn Sally's house, Max, Derek, Warren, and Sally explain their backstories. They ask Eli to explain his backstory, and he tells them that he killed his dad.\nChapter 235\nEli claimed when he was younger, he used to have parents, but his father got drunk and would hit his wife. When Eli's mother ran away his father married a new woman who was physically and emotionally abusive towards him. When Eli's father died his wife married a new man who was just as abusive. Eli grew sick of his treatment and ran away from home with Lyon, saying that it was more comfortable on the streets.\nEveryone is shocked to hear his story, and Warren asks if Eli has any good memories. Eli mentions a hide and seek game he used to play with his biological mother, and Sally suggests that they play. Eli doesn't want to play but the others race to find hiding spots. Warren opts out of the game, and Eli begins to count.\nMax and Derrick are the first to be found. Lyon scratches Max and he yells, causing Eli to find him. Eli then suddenly attacks Max, and when Derrick comes to the rescue he beats up Derrick as well. Sally moves around during the game and finds Max and Derrick on the ground. She freezes and Eli finds her. Right as he is about to punch her he is stopped by Warren, who asks what he is doing. Eli explains that he is it, and Sally realizes that Eli was abused by his first mother as well.\nWarren asks Eli why he didn't hit him back, and Eli says he doesn't fight unless he gets something from it. Warren offers Eli anything he wants if Eli wins to fight, and if he loses Eli has to leave Sally's place. Eli stands to fight him.\nChapter 236\nWarren and Eli start fighting, and Warren notices that Eli fights very dirty, poking him in the eyes and kicking him in his manhood. When Warren is knocked to the ground Eli grabs a sign to smash his head in, and Warren sees that Eli has the eyes of a killer. Max and Derrick manage to hold Eli back, and Sally tells all of them to get out. They stop fighting because none of them want to freeze in the cold.\nSally asks Eli why he is fighting over her and he says he wanted to try on Warren's uniform. He explains that he only liked the hide and seek game because that was when his mother payed any attention to him. Warren gives Eli his jacket and calls the fight between them a draw.\nAt Sally's cram school she finds herself surrounded by Backdoor members. Her friend Olly Wang tries to diffuse the situation but is beaten. Eli shows up looking for Sally, and the Backdoor members mistake him for Warren Chae. He beats them all and Sally thanks him and introduces him to her friends\nHeather\nand\nOlly\n, later stating that if Eli hadn't met them their story may have been less tragic.\nChapter 237\nSally begins spending her food on her new roommates, causing her to miss school.

Warren and Gun are shocked to see the savage look on Eli's face.\nChapter 242\nAs Gun marvels at Eli's savagery, Jerry and Johan quarrel over the right to Gangdong. Jerry says he will allow Johan if he can land a scratch on his face, and Johan uses Lyon to scratch him. Eli and Johan begin fighting, with Johan easily winning the fight. When Johan knocks Eli out, he asks Gun to give him the right to Gangdong. Gun refuses because Johan is too weak, and Eli proves this by knocking him out in one shot.

However, when Jiho was with\nJay\nand\nDaniel,\nthe girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Jiho thought it is because Jay and Daniel both had a lot of money to buy expensive clothes and silently berates them for not having to work hard to get expensive goods, even though his mother had bought him the backpack.\nAll of a sudden, Jiho notices that Jay had forgotten his wallet when he rushed over to Daniel's seat when Daniel said he didn't know how to do a problem. Jiho comments on how Jay's so good to Daniel it's ridiculous, running to him just because Daniel had called. Jiho is about to call out to Jay to tell him about his wallet, but decides to pocket it instead to play a prank on Jay.\nJiho, Jay and Daniel are later at the convenience store, and Jiho's thanking Jay for buying him a lot of snacks. Jay waves at him while Daniel translates that Jay's telling him it's fine and for him to eat up. The lady at the counter tells them it's 21500 won. When Jay reaches into his jacket to pay for the snacks, Jiho looks on expectantly, thinking he'll look ridiculous when he realizes his wallet's gone. However, Jay takes out his cell phone and pays with it instead. Jay and Daniel bow to the sales lady and leave.\nLater, in the washroom, Jiho huffs, saying that it's no fun and that, if he had known, he would have just given Jay the wallet. He opens Jay's wallet to find pictures of\nEnu\nand an American Express credit card, which Jiho mistakenly thinks is a VIP card for a coffee shop. He then sees a 10 million won check in the wallet. Scared, he realizes he's landed himself in big trouble.\nHe then resolves to go and return the wallet to Jay, say he's just found it, and apologize, but decides to go and sneakily return it to Jay instead so Jay wouldn't know.\nJiho first tries to stick it in Jay's left pant pocket while walking past Jay. However, when he sneaks up to Jay, Jay sees three bees and hits them out of the air because Jay's scared of bugs. Jiho, after witnessing Jay's reflexes, decides to try another plan instead.\nHe then tries to put it in Jay's backpack after school is out. However, no matter how hard Jiho pulled on it, it wouldn't open. When Jay comes along, Jiho realizes it has a fingerprint lock.\nJiho then tries to catch Jay when he's leaving school, apologize, and return the wallet to him, only to have Jay rush away on a motorcycle.\nAs Jiho walks back home, he resignedly wonders how he can contact Jay again because he doesn't know Jay's phone number. After all, it's 10 million won. Then, Jiho realizes that all he has to do is put the wallet in Jay's desk. However, just as he realizes it, a trio of bullies come and forces him to exchange backpacks. Jiho belatedly realizes that Jay's wallet, containing the 10 million won, was still in the backpack they had stolen.",

Daniel then returns to the bullies with his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him. New Daniel then takes Jiho to Jay's home.

Daniel tries to get Vasco to stop because the customer is known for his bad temper, but, instead, the customer apologizes meekly.\nLater, when a middle-aged looking woman comes over to buy alcohol, Vasco asks for her identification. Angered, she asks how old they were to be ordering her around. Vasco replies he's 16. Daniel tries to explain that the lady has bought alcohol every day already, but, instead, the woman apologizes and calls Vasco \"oppa,\" showing that she was actually younger than them.\nWhen nobody was coming, Daniel began to exercise during the break. Vasco watches him, wondering why he wasn't losing any weight even though he was so diligent. Suddenly, Daniel sits down, saying he's very tired so he should replenish his energy. He starts wolfing down a hamburger. Vasco realizes the reason why Daniel can't lose any weight is because he's eating so much and orders that Daniel goes on a diet. Daniel can't stand it, and starts wondering why his other body wasn't getting fat even though they both eat the same amount. All of a sudden, he realizes the fifth truth: his other body's shape can't change.\nThe next day, at the cafeteria, Daniel heaps food onto his plate and wolfs it all down. Girls, seeing him, giggles and says he eats like a man. However, when Ji Ho tries to do the same thing, they call him uncivilized and dirty instead.\nHowever, at night, Daniel realizes that, no matter how much his new body eats, his original body is still very hungry. When he goes training with Vasco in the morning, he feels weak and hungry. He takes out a banana that he had saved from before, but Vasco snatches it away, saying that he shouldn't eat it.

He rushes home, scared, and looks around, only to find nobody there.\nThe next day, Daniel tapes pieces of tape to the door, and, when he rushes home, realizes that they hadn't been touched, showing nobody had opened the door during the day. He pushes the door open, and sees nothing has been touched and everything was just as messy as before. He rushes to the sink and is incredibly relieved to realize that the dishes hadn't been washed either.\nIn a moment of dramatic irony, the scene cuts to a cockroach, and then zooms out to show that it was crawling on the stalker girl's face as she lies in the space under the kitchen sink, grinning and saying that, as long as she's able to see Daniel, she would be happy. As she lies under the sink, she sees original Daniel slap his new body to get ready for school, and wonders why, whenever he switches bodies, one of them falls unconscious. She grins creepily as she realizes that it means that she should be able to take one of them.",

Daniel replies yes, and that he exercises with a friend (Vasco) every morning before going home. Crystal, finding something in common, exclaims that she also often exercises as well. Daniel looks at her suspiciously, wondering if she's bragging about staying in shape. At the same time Crystal thinks that original Daniel is kind, fond of small animals, determined, and hard working, and wonders why someone as good as him would live with someone like new Daniel.\nShe asks Daniel whether the stalker's been coming around anymore lately, and he replies that no, she hasn't, and thanks Crystal for helping, but asks how she knew which place was his. Crystal, not wanting to reveal that she's been investigating him under orders of her father, explains that she saw it when she came over to feed Enu. The stalker angrily wonders who she is and decides she must have her eyes on new Daniel and wants to steal him away.\nZoe comes over right afterwards, asking if he'd seen the stalker again and offering to walk to school with him. She then notices how the place where Daniel lives isn't really fancy so she asks what Daniel's parents do. He answers that his mother does a little of everything and Zoe mistakenly believes that his mother's in charge of a huge company that dabbles in a bit of everything and is incredibly impressed. Unbeknownst to them, the stalker watches them from within Daniel's room, and thinks that Zoe is there to seduce Daniel as well. She wonders when the permission form will be sent to her, and frantically check her cell phone only to smile when she realizes that it's just been approved.\nWhile at school, Daniel tells his classmates about his stalker. Zoe offers to walk with Daniel to school every morning, and says it'll be great if original Daniel comes along as well. Jay suddenly hands Daniel a utility knife and tells him to keep it. Daniel doesn't know why Jay is handing it to him but accepts. As he looks down at his hands he sees the ring the stalker had on, and realized that it must have been put onto him while he was asleep, showing that the girl was still in his home.\nFrantically, he runs back home and realizes that his original body had disappeared. He looks all over the place for a sign of the stalker. When he checks the space under the kitchen sink, he realizes that, although nobody was there, there were a lot of soiled adult diapers. The stalker girl appears behind him and tasers him.",

The stalker is seen coming out of the bath, talking to an unconscious Daniel. She says that the two of them can live together forever, and that she's put the \"annoying pig\" in a place where nobody would ever find him.\nMeanwhile, original Daniel tries to scream under the tape on his mouth and flails in his bonds. He tries rolling around and falls onto the ground. Suddenly, he feels something sharp and starts to use it to cut at his bonds. When he is finally able to take off his blindfold and open his eyes, he finds himself in a room that is covered with his own photographs. He realizes he'd fallen out of the closet full of wine bottles, and the sharp object he had used to cut off the ropes was actually a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After wondering for a while what he should do, he decides to run to the police office.\nThe policeman, upon hearing his story, are surprised at hearing his story and commends him for running to report it immediately. When Daniel gives his address, the first policeman tells Daniel to wait a moment because the address Daniel had given was an hour away from the police station, which didn't fit with Daniel's story that he had directly ran to the police office after he saw the crime. The police then comments on how Daniel smells of alcohol, and decides he must be drunk. When Daniel replies he hadn't drank, the police admonish him for lying and begin interrogating him.\nSuddenly, Daniel loses consciousness as his other body wakes to find himself bound to a chair with his arms behind his back. They're in another room that's also covered with pictures of himself, and there's a circle of candles surrounding them. He asks her why she's doing this to him, to which she replies that they are one. She explains that this is their new home, and she'd specially decorated it for him, and that there were even some couple photos of them. She also explains that she's eating his fingernails and toenails as a snack, which she ate earlier when Daniel saw her outside his door.\nDaniel exclaims that she can't do this, that she'd also kidnapped his \"friend\" and that this was illegal. However, the stalker only turns around, grinning, saying that she knew his \"little secret\".",

Daniel doesn't correct her, and decides to figure out where he is. When she refuses to tell him, he says that he won't marry her. The stalker is angry, thinking he's lying to her, and tasers him again.\nWhen Daniel wakes up in his original body, he's still in the police station, and the police still think he's lying. He asks Crystal for help. The police promise to help and are very reverent towards Crystal because it turns out she's very close to the department head. When Crystal asks how Daniel had contacted her without a cell phone, he explains he'd sent a message to original Crystal and asked her to pass the message on. Crystal offers to help find new Daniel, and Daniel thanks her and leaves, saying he's already found a lead.\nCrystal calls\nKouji\nand tells him to locate Daniel's cellphone. The Kouji tells her that he's not going to do it, but Crystal only tells him Daniel's phone number and hangs up. She looks incredibly angry and says that nobody should bully her Daniel.\nOriginal Daniel, on the other hand, heads to a telephone stand where he calls the number of the noodle restaurant where the stalker had called for takeaway. He'd memorized the phone number of the restaurant while tied up in his new body. He asks the restaurant to tell him the address of the woman who'd called for two bowls of noodles. However, when the restaurant owner hears his request, he seems to mistake Daniel for a stalker instead and hangs up.\nCrystal had already gotten the address from the Kouji through text. He tells her that it's a good thing Daniel's cell phone was still on, and tells her she shouldn't go alone and should bring Gun with her. She replies that Gun had went with Goo out of the country, and that it was an emergency, so she can deal with any danger by herself. The Kouji replies that it's true, she isn't pretty when she gets mad either, and tells her that it's free this time, but he wants her to think over his last request some more. As she gets closer to the address the Kouji's sent her, Crystal starts to get a little scared. However, when she arrives, she starts because she realizes she's been here before.",

She ties her up in a chair next to Daniel, saying that they should settle this dispute between themselves before \u201cher husband\u201d wakes up. Crystal then says that she knows the stalker, because she was also DG's stalker. The stalker asks if Crystal is talking about her ex-boyfriend, and says that she seems to have an interest in all of the stalker's past boyfriends. She continues to say that Crystal can have DG because she is already married now. The stalker's wearing a headdress, a white dress, and holding flowers, but Crystal realizes that the headdress is actually lace underwear and the stalker\u2019d made the wedding dress herself.\nCrystal asks her if she knows what she's doing. After all, she'd already kidnapped 3 people already. The stalker laughs and tells Crystal how she'd always been discriminated against because of her looks, but immediately starts talking about how a pig (original Daniel) would dare to sleep in her spot without even realizing how unfit he is. Crystal points out this discrepancy, telling the stalker that, even though she blames society's lookism, she herself is only attracted to handsome guys. Angered, the stalker lunges forward to taser her, only for original Daniel to walk in through the door.\nIn a flashback, original Daniel had continued to call the noodle restaurant, telling the owner that he was trying to help a friend who was in danger. The owner, hearing that he was trying to help a friend, changes his mind about the matter extremely quickly and tells Daniel the address. To his surprise, it turned out to be his home.\nThe stalker asks how he changed bodies when she hadn't slapped him, and Crystal is surprised to hear this. Daniel wants to use his strength to defeat the stalker, but the stalker throws a candle at him, and, when he's dodging the candle she tasers him. He falls unconscious and wakes up in his new body. Meanwhile, Crystal starts crying for the stalker to stop hurting original Daniel while the stalker continues to electrocute his unconscious body. She calls the girl a stalker, and the stalker tries to taser her but Daniel takes the hit, telling her not to hurt Crystal. The stalker begins to hit Daniel repeatedly until he is covered with blood.\nShe then tells him he should apologize, because then she'll forgive him, but she doesn't know he is only buying time for Crystal to escape while handing her Jay's utility knife. However, even though Crystal's hand was on the door knob, she hesitates to leave him behind.",

He can fast enough to hit Gun, and does so multiple times. He is powerful and very skilled, but it is not enough to beat Gun. Gun states that Johan's only weakness is that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with a one punch.\nAs Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him. He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out the way by Zack. He asks if Johan is okay and Johan stops crying. Gun asks Zack who he is and Zack calls himself Johan's friend.",

Jake takes Jiho's side and allows him into Big Deal, kicking out Jason because he lost. Brad is sad that Jake is changing, and wonders what to tell Jerry.\nIn the cafeteria Mr. Kim sits down with Jiho and asks him to turn himself in. He mentions that Jiho used to be different in high school, and tells him he can change. Jiho tells Mr. Kim that he has left his old self behind and knocks him out with his food tray. Guards swarm in and Brad thinks it is over for Jiho, but the inmates confess to his crime instead of Jiho. Brad sees the dangerous level of influence Jiho had on the inmates and is afraid that Jiho will lead to the destruction of Big Deal.",

The picture that Mr. Kim thought was of a house was actually a picture of himself with the spinner in his mouth, foreshadowing the violence Jiho had towards the counselor.\nCookie 2 is Jiho standing after having beaten a number of inmates. He kept the fidget spinner from Mr. Kim and affirms that he doesn't need to be strong, he just needs to win.\nCookie 3 is the guards deciding who to release. They decide between Jiho or Jake",

Vin begins to hear that the VIPs are also fearing him because of his eye condition. Vin remembers his past, where he tries (apparently) to poke out his eye. Vin, enraged at having remembered this, puts Akira in a sort of armbar, to dislocate the Japanese's shoulder, which he succeeds in, thus ending his fight without too many problems. The state in which Akira ends up reminds Vin of the time he finds out Jewoo had his arms and legs dislocated, which pisses him off.\nNeko warns Kenta that he must stop them from proceeding, due to some problem involving the next game, Kenta understands, Zack Lee pesters Kenta by challenging him, Kenta pushes Zack away with just one punch, Zack then says that this will be his opponent, but Kenta As for the three (Warren, Vin and Zack), however small he may seem, his presence is much greater.\nThere is a flashback of Kenta kneeling in front of Gun Park.",

To his shock, Daniel realizes that the person sitting next to him is\nZack\n, the boy who punched him earlier.\nZoe Park\nbegins flirting with him, and Daniel is confused how to respond. Zack sees\nMira\nstaring at Daniel and he becomes jealous of him. The next scene is set in the cafeteria, where Daniel eats with Zoe. He is happy he isn't being bullied, and is unaware of her aggressive protectiveness over him.\nDoo and his friends confront Daniel and tell him to meet them after lunch, which worries Daniel. Surprisingly they offer him a cigarette and say that he should hook them up with girls. Daniel lies to them that he quit smoking (so that he doesn't have to smoke while not making himself look 'uncool') and informs them that he doesn't know any girls. The three other boys, including Doo, feel intimidated and think of Daniel as imposing while he quickly runs off in fear.\nLater, Daniel is seen peacefully sleeping with Zoe watching him adoringly. Daniel wakes up in his old body and panics, trying to force himself to sleep. As he wakes up he accidentally swears at Zoe, but this only makes her fall for him even more.",

        "summary": "The episode begins with unnamed spectators admiring Binu for her pedigree as a purebred retriever. These spectators then proceed to ridicule Enu, Binu's puppy, for not being a purebred retriever. Undeterred by their disparaging remarks, young Byeol insists upon raising Enu, suggesting that they \"live together forever.\" As the two grow older, however, Byeol comes to regard Enu as others do. The frequent criticism directed towards Enu begins to influence her decisions; Byeol ceases to bring Enu along with her when she goes on outings, ordering the dog to stay at home. This eventually culminates with Byeol giving the order to stay when her family moves, and it is thus that the girl abandons the pet she'd once desired to live with all her life.\nEnu, being an obedient dog, stays. She stays by the gate after the sky grows dark, and she continues staying after it darkens again. She stays after new occupants move into the house, and she stays after she has grown thin and dirty. She stays even after her ribs begin to protrude out from under her skin.\nThe neighbors pity Enu, and denounce Byeol and her family for leaving the dog behind. They do not report Enu's status as an abandoned pet, understanding that the common response to such animals is to euthanize them. The neighbors therefore make shallow attempts to help the dog by offering her food. Enu, however, reacts to them aggressively. She barks at them and bares her teeth, mistaking them for thieves. It is revealed that Enu believes the house to still belong to Byeol and her family, and that she must therefore perform her duty as their dog by guarding it until they return.\nNight falls once more, and the temperatures with it. Enu is shown lying on the ground, shivering from how cold she feels. Her face is buried into the scarf Byeol gave her to wear.\nThe scene transitions to\nJ High School\n. The nameless teacher who announced the arrival of\nDaniel Park\nas a transfer student now informs the Fashion Department's first-year class of yet another such transfer. As with Daniel, the immediate response from the class is to ask whether the student is a guy or a girl. Upon hearing that the student is a girl,\nKay Jang\n,\nHan Park\n, and\nDoo Lee\nexpress great excitement. Then\nCrystal Choi\nwalks into the room, and the trio sit back with dejected looks on their faces.\nDaniel stares at Crystal, thinking of how unusual it is to transfer into a new school right before winter vacation, and of how similar the girl is to him. The girl in question, meanwhile, stands amid hushed gibes. She gazes out at her new classmates and mentally divides them into different cliques, categorizing\nMira Kim\n,\nYui Kim\n, and\nZoe Park\nas \"cool girls\"; three unnamed girls as \"outsiders,\" but also the group she belongs with;\nJay Hong\n,\nDaniel Park\n, and\nZack Lee\nas the \"cool guys\"; and Han Park, Doo Lee, and Kay Jang as \"guys who mock and embarrass\" her. Due to the treatment she receives whenever she transfers, Crystal is uninterested in school and chooses to hide in quiet corners while there. Daniel cannot tear his eyes away from her as he recalls the humiliation he suffered from his classmates in his original body.\nRight after it is whispered that Crystal \"looks funny\" and is a \"weirdo,\" Daniel approaches her. He greets her with a hello and a friendly smile, and introduces himself. The boy also chides Doo Lee for his comments regarding the area where Crystal lives.",

They both head to the Han River, thinking that they \"don't want to split.\"\nVasco turns out to be partying in the park, in the wintertime, on a blanket. He is incredibly happy that Daniel made it, and the latter excuses his new body by saying that he is sick. Vasco asks if Crystal is Daniel's girlfriend, which he denies.

Zack tries to leave the fool's party, but Mira convinces him to stay. They sing Happy Birthday to Vasco, and everyone is relieved when the candles are blown out, as surely Vasco would move inside now; but Vasco pretends not to notice and blows anyway.\nDaniel gives Vasco pictures of Enu's pups, since he knows about Vasco's love of dogs. Vasco is touched. Jace, who searched for months, presents Vasco with a Special Edition Heroman figurine. Vasco is moved. Zack grabs a rock and writes \"GOOD LUCK\" on it, insisting that it was a treasure from his mother and it will grant good luck to its owner. Vasco is again moved, as the others note that Zack isn't even bothering to hide the magic marker. Taejoon creates a Pacebook account for Vasco and gathers 100,000 followers, which Vasco responds to with apathy.\nVasco wants to play a recreational mating game, in which \"three\" consists of the third Burn Knuckle, Jace, and Daniel, the last two wondering what would happen to Vasco and Crystal. Jace tries again to move the party indoors but fails. Vasco calls \"two\" and reaches for Mira, but Zack, in a burst of fury, clips his nose. Vasco, blood streaming from his face, insists that it was an accident, and they move on.\nDaniel is chosen to play Duck, Duck, Goose. The three Burn Knuckles try again to talk to Vasco, but when he thanks Jace for always being his friend, Jace is too moved to speak. Zack tries to leave again, but it stopped by Mira. Then, Zack thinks about making Vasco mad. He takes out the Heroman figurine, replaces it with his rock, and throws the present into the river, saying that \"Heroman went for a swim in the water.\" Vasco jumps in after the present.",

At last, Zack jumps into the river with the figurine that he took out earlier and calls to Vasco.\nVasco and Zack get out and have some warm drinks, but Vasco realizes that Zack's rock and the Heroman box are still missing.

Trust Zack. Trust Daniel. Trust Hostel. Trust Vasco. Trust Euntae Tee. I...did it. I overcame it. If I did it, so can you.\" \u2014 Vasco trying to persuade Eli Jang, Ep. 459 Euntae Lee (\uc774\uc740\ud0dc Lee Eun Tae) , better known as Vasco, is a secondary character in Lookism. Once a young boy who suffered from extreme physical bullying, Vasco vowed to protect the weak by becoming strong enough to beat the bad guys. He would train and push the limits of his body. Eventually, he became so physically strong that he could win a fight with just a single shoulder grab. With his newfound strength, Vasco would go around Central Seoul finding delinquents and trying to get them to stop smoking via his shoulder grip. His raw strength and pure intentions would resonate with many of the delinquents. Most quit smoking and began to follow Vasco. Going as far as to enroll in J High School just to be closer to him. This newfound following would eventually lead to the creation of Burn Knuckles. They would use their power to protect the weak while preventing major gangs from forming in Central Seoul, thereby inadvertently preventing any of the Four Major Crews from taking over Central Seoul and keeping the territory neutral. Halfway during 1st year, he would meet and eventually befriend Daniel Park. This friendship would eventually lead him into the underworld of Seoul's Generations, filled with crime and unchecked violence. Seeing such injustice and how much it affected his friends, he swore to help Daniel destroy the four crews. Since then, Vasco and Burn Knuckles have been in numerous gang fights throughout Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the Four Major Crews, 1st Generation Kings, HNH Company, and Workers. Currently, he is a student in the Architecture Department at J High School, the leader of Burn Knuckles, and one of the founding members of Allied. His current goal is to prevent James Lee and Kitae Kim from starting another generation of war.",
        "appearance": "Episodes 7-366 PTJ art style changing overtime (Episodes 7-366) From his first appearance in Episode 7, Vasco stood out as looking older than his age. His skin is fair and smooth, with a slender face and jet-black hair parted in the center. Vasco has dark, almond eyes with thin eyebrows. He has a well-toned muscular body with Japanese-style tattoos covering both arms and pectorals. Vasco, despite his slender face, grows an impressive amount of facial hair, often sporting a bushy beard and small mustache. Throughout the story, Vasco refused to wear the school's uniform, opting instead to wear various kinds of Burn Knuckles jumpsuits until the 2nd year. He always wrapped the jumpsuit shirt around his waist, along with a white undershirt. Due to his clothing choices, it's easy to mistake him for an active gangster. At the time of the blind date (episodes 178-179) Vasco doesn't care about his appearance and regularly forgets to groom. However, as seen in Vasco's Blind Date, when he decides to get dressed up, he becomes a different person. He turns into a pretty boy by shaving and cleverly hiding his physique with his clothes. Instead of scaring people away, his attractive appearance makes him look more younger and approachable. Youth Childhood and Middle School Days (Episodes 51-57) Throughout his elementary and middle school days, Vasco was underweight for his age. His arms were like sticks, and you could see his ribs from the sides. It's a big contrast from the muscular body he has now. He still had the same hairstyle, and his eyes were just as narrow. He gained many vulgar scars around his body from his former bullies in middle school, his many tattoos being a way to cover them up.",
        "personality": "Even being stated by Jace, Euntae is known to have a unique personality. Although he appears to look scary and menacing, Euntae is actually very pure-hearted and innocent. He cares deeply for those who get treated in an ill manner in society and risks his own life to protect them. Euntae believes that everyone should be treated fairly and the views of respect they achieve should be based on their actions, not on their looks. Euntae is also a strong-willed person, not afraid to keep trying his best to achieve his goals. While he is a strong-minded and headstrong person, Euntae is surprisingly very sensitive and delicate whenever he is emotionally upset. Some examples are when he starts crying when girls bought other male students at the Auction but didn't want to buy him because they thought he looked too fearsome. Another moment when Euntae starts crying was when he said that people took him for a fool. Euntae is quite compassionate and appreciates the special bonds he has with his friends, especially Jace. Euntae also wants to help the less appreciated people in society become stronger so that they can defeat those who torment and oppress them. Euntae seems to have a strong respect for teachers and higher authorities in general. He also has respect for the mama bear that raised him in one Night arc and even says that he can't ever lose in respect to his master Brendak. As the story progresses, Euntae has an increase in his desire to grow. Originally branching from an empathetic mindset, he expressed a sensibility to others situations. Believing that he should always save those who cannot fend for themselves and are weak, he ambitions to become a superhero for them, coming from his understanding of his experience in bullying and self-hatred. However, as result of his self-obsession with becoming a better person, Euntae transforms into believing anyone associated with wrongdoing is inherently bad, with no pity to understand their perspective. His mindset is revolutionized to become the 'villain' as of result. He states to Jake, \"For me to beat the bad guys, I have to become one.\"",
        "fighting_techniques": "After doing 100 push-ups, 100 pull-ups, 100 squats and running 10 km every day for 2 years, Euntae is one of the strongest characters in the entire series. Many of the delinquents of middle school who dared challenge him were taken down from a single shoulder grab. Euntae's strength has been so overpowering, he has shown in numerous fights to simply take people out in a single move and even lift some up with a single hand. And while Euntae was unable to match with Daniel's new body, he was able to compete with him when he was drunk. Euntae is also incredibly fast as during the live streaming arc and Fake Bank account arc he is seen covering vast distances very easily. When he met up with Joon Goo once again and after doubling his already insane workout, Euntae got progressively stronger. He lifted Logan Lee with one of his legs, bent steel bars in the Picnic arc and break bones casually. After his training from Brekdak, Euntae has some training in Muay Thai. Finally, Euntae is known for his indomitable will power and endurance. He is willing to go through immense physical pain and never give in or surrender. His aura in fact as been noted to be terrifying to even gangsters. After training with Brekdak and the bears for a short time, Euntae's strength and endurance grew unto unbelievable levels, as he still managed to attack after getting his legs crushed by Vin Jin. Given his golden Mongkol, it is implied that he has mastered his Muay Thai training and from living in the wilderness with his bear/master, he managed to unlock a new technique called the Death Blow: a powerful punch that can send people flying. After retraining again with Brekdak for the month leading up to the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Brekdak himself stated that Vasco's physique and power is enough to take on just about anyone (but was eventually proven wrong as he couldn't handle a blow from James Lee), but that statement was holding up pretty well as the sheer force of his blows was pushing Mandeok extremely far back; Mandeok would have lost the fight as Mandeok himself thought that it is shocking that such as little body (stated by him) generated so much power. Techniques Used Runner's High In the Worker's First Affiliate arc when Euntae was fighting against Eli Jang, It was revealed that the first forbidden move of Brekdak is actually controlling a phenomenon known as \"Runner's High\" where a person can feel euphoria after tremendous physical activity (like The Stage or Mastery). After rigorous training, Euntae was able to control the phenomenon and his eyes become pale white and his body unlocks its peak potential. Brekdak also mentioned that when the Runner's high is controlled, all other techniques that Euntae mastered can be evolved. In the second half of the fight with Eli Jang, Euntae used the 1st Forbidden skill and immediately overpowered Eli, defeating him. Eli noticed at that moment Euntae's speed, destructive power, and all other physical aspects doubled. Unlike Daniel when using Ultra Instinct in his second body, he loses all control and becomes a fighting machine, Euntae maintains his sanity while using Runner's High. By the Busan arc the power of Runner high further developed making Vasco a literal beast he fought with King of Incheon alongside Allied crew and his strikes and hits became so powerful that it made the King of Incheon take up his guard to defend against Vasco and Allied he also easily devastated the succesors of Busan crew with Vinjin and fought Jinrang without falling down.

If you give it your all, your body will not betray your effort.\"",
        "trivia": "Euntae is modeled after Bill Stax. a South Korean rapper. Brekdak and most of the characters in the anime pronounce Euntee nickname as \"Basco\" due to the V sounding like a B while saying it in a Korean accent. Aside from doing suggested training regiments from Goo, Vasco also attends a gym. Euntae loves dogs, especially Golden Retrievers. When Daniel Park was taking care of Inu, he really wanted to see her and was excited to see the puppies, he never knew Jay Hong was actually taking care of them. There are at least 5 particular panels that are humorously repeated in which Euntae is shown with a tear streaming down his face with Jace witnessing this and thinking to himself, \"Euntae...\" There were a lot of references to One Punch Man referencing Euntae When Euntae asks Joon Goo how he can get stronger, Joon Goo's advice to Euntae is to do one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10 km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3. Moreover, in the Lee Euntae arc, Jace gets angry at the bullies when he sees them after they'd grown up, saying that, because of them, he'd had to train so hard with Euntae he'd almost gotten bald, which is also a Saitama reference. Another reference is in Episode 112, when Euntae tells Daniel to go on a diet, he is given a banana to eat in the morning, which also seems to reference the diet Saitama talks about in One Punch Man, Episode 3. The nickname \"Vasco\" was given to Euntae because \"Vasco\" in the universe of the work is a cartoon/comic hero, who fights for justice by protecting the weak.",

Bum Jae helped Euntae get over his fear of needles, by getting tattoos together, and even has a tattoo of his hero-man E.T. (Euntae). The duo is very close with each other and they often work out together. Bum Jae seems to be a bit protective over Euntae, to the point of installing a lover app to track him and making sure that he does not get hurt or get into a big mess. The reason Bum Jae is so protective over Euntae maybe because he felt that he could never make up for the time he ditched Euntae back in middle school. However, this is not confirmed. Euntae often asks for his advice either about the Burn Knuckles and even his personal life. Bum Jae is also vice-leader of Burn Knuckles, which shows how much Euntae trusts him. The duo are extremely close and their friendship is admired by many people. Goo Kim In the Lee Euntae Arc, when Euntae was being bullied, another boy who was getting bullied was a relative of Goo Kim and paid him to beat up the bullies. When Goo Kim arrives, he sees how much the bullies had hurt Euntae and says that this time will be free because, with an obvious victim, Goo Kim can do whatever he wants to them. Euntae asks Goo Kim how he can get stronger, whose advise was to do one hundred push ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10 km run each day.

He is sometimes strict, checking bags for alcohol, cigarettes and cellphones, which aren't allowed on site. He is also reasonable, telling students that he hopes they don't hold a grudge against him for taking away prohibited items as it is a camp rule. However, this turns out to be only an act as he is actually a repeated sexual offender and that he is using a part-time job as a camp counselor so he could post pictures of female students online.",

Instead of punishing Heemin, the teacher tells Seungpyo to give Heemin the snacks because Seungpyo needed to lose weight.\nLater, when he flips up the skirt of a girl as a junior school student, she doesn't get upset. As a senior in high school, a girl cheats on her boyfriend, Jaehan, with Heemin, telling him that she'll break up with Jaehan if Heemin would date her. Heemin comes to the conclusion that all girls must love him because of his attractive appearance.\nIn a later chapter, it is revealed he went to the same kindergarten or school with Daniel's stalker. Her first memory was Heemin telling her not to talk to him after making a ribbon ring for him.\nAutumn Boot Camp Arc\nZeus appears as a camp instructor. He checked bags for alcohol and cigarettes and told students to hand in cell phones.\nDaniel, in his original body, realizes that Zeus is actually a rapist and repeated sexual offender when he puts up a wanted poster in the convenience store where he works. In fact, Zeus had taken pictures of Mijin and other female students and had uploaded them online.\nZeus asks Mijin to help him put boxes into storage, when Won Bin, the other camp instructor, tackles him to the ground. Won Bin had realized something was going on when he repeatedly saw Zeus hanging around Mijin. Won Bin stole Zeus's cellphone and found out that he was taking photos of students and posting them online. Mijin, confused as to what was going on, believes Won Bin to be the pervert instead as he was holding Zeus's cellphone.\nZeus turns the tables on Won Bin, kicking him repeatedly. He then reveals the fact that he had taken the photos to Mijin. Mijin, scared, screams for help, but Zeus punches her, telling her not to play hard to get as she had allegedly flirted with him earlier. When she pleads with him to let her go, telling him that she wouldn't report him. He gets mad at her for saying so because he doesn't think he is doing anything wrong. Punching her, he tells Mijin that it was her fault for wearing revealing clothing and seducing him first, and tells her that it isn't rape.\nJin Sung\nwalks to see a crying and bleeding Mijin trying to hold Zeus off while he unbuckles her pants. Enraged, Jin Sung attacks him, only for Zeus to grab him. Jin Sung belatedly realizes that Zeus knows Muay Thai, and Zeus is able to break his ribs and both his arms. Zeus thinks he has won, but Won Bin suddenly graps Zeus's leg. Won Bin, unable to stand up, had crawled over to stop Zeus. Jin Sung punches Zeus in the face despite his broken arms. When Daniel finds Jin Sung and Mijin, they find Jin Sung out of his mind, repeatedly punching Zeus in the face.\nAs Zeus is being led away by the cops, bystanders comment that he looks too handsome to be a sexual offender and speculates about it being a false charge. Meanwhile, they laugh at the fact that Won Bin looks more like the perpetrator than the hero.\nIn prison, Zeus realizes that the leader of the prisoners is Gangnam Landlord from the Paprika TV Arc, or the stalker who assaulted Ha Neul.",

He does not like her romantically.\nJohan Seong\nJace worked with Johan to save his crush from the Cheongliang Branch of Hostel. He did not like Johan's reckless personality, but later on he found himself wanting to become friends.",
        "background": "Jace and Vasco were childhood friends. When they were both young, they played with their \"Hero Man\" figurines. While playing Vasco would often question Jace about why the Hero Man would use his role as a superhero. However, despite being annoyed by these questions and hitting Vasco, both become good friends.\nAfter reaching middle school, Jace mingled with 3 other students in their class. Jace, Vasco, and the three other students meet three upperclassmen bullies. When asked to smoke, Jace was interrupted from accepting the cigarette when Vasco told him smoking was bad. Embarrassed, the three bullies starting picking on Vasco, and despite watching this all happen Jace didn't do anything, The two friends starting growing and Jace soon started to ignore Vasco's suffering. Even after witnessing Vasco crying by himself, Jace ran away. Afterwards, Vasco disappeared from school and Jace was forced to bring him back or take his place in getting bullied.\nJace saw all of the crude tattoos and wounds Vasco had received from the bullies and went to school telling the bullies Vasco was sick. This angered them and he was threatened until Vasco showed up. Vasco and the bullies started fighting but he was quickly overpowered. Jace begged the bullies to stop but all they did was beat him. Cicada, another student the bullies picked on arrived with his cousin, Goo, who preceded to beat all the bullies.\nAfter all the bullies were forced to move from the school, Jace finds out that Vasco had developed Aichmophobia, the phobia of sharp objects. To help his friend, Jace got a tattoo of a bird on his chest. Later Jace is seen to have a tattoo saying \"My Hero Man ET.\" When questioned by Vasco why he had ET tattooed, Jace replied that he really liked the movie. However, it is revealed that ET stood for Euntae, who was Jace's hero man.",
        "plot": "Jace was first introduced in Lookism as Vasco's second in command. He initially did not like Daniel Park, because he was causing trouble in J High. After seeing Daniel become interested in the Burn Knuckles, he became more accepting of him. When Daniel first began training with Vasco, Jace did not approve of Daniel because he thought he would quit soon. However, Daniel was persistent in his training and proved Jace wrong, so he started to warm up to little Daniel, even calling him a friend.\nJace and the Burn Knuckles show up a lot in the story to help Vasco in his battles. The first battle they appeared in was the Secondhand Rana arc, where they helped Vasco fight against Woojin's gang. They also attacked by the God Dogs, but they refused to fight until Vasco gave them the order. When Vasco pretended to be a runaway, Jace gathered the Burn Knuckles to look for him. They found Riley Oh instead, and he was arrested by the police.\nWhen Vasco was framed for stealing Jasmine's wallet, Jace was the one who convicted Jasmine for lying. He became interested in Hostel once he discovered people from Hostel bought Jasmine's paraphernalia and sold it to perverts. He decided to help Daniel destroy the four gangs, telling him he would need a lot more help than before. He was smart enough to challenge Jin Jang's analysis of the J High kids, and the latter marked Jace as his first target to destroy.\nJace visited Cheonliang with Vasco to gain information on Hostel, but he became distracted when he fell in love with a girl on the train. The girl was a Hostel member, and Jace feared she would be used in a prostitution scam. Vasco missed the train, but Johan offered to help Jace under the terms of a contract. The two of them found the girl, and went their separate ways. Jace reunited with Vasco and started dating the girl from the train."

His hair is black and his eyes are a deep brown.\nThroughout the series, he cycles through 3 different hairstyles. From his introduction, he has the typical hair length of a Korean male, that is slicked to the side of his forehead. When brought back to the story in the\nJuvenile Prison Arc\n, he has an edgar-style haircut. By the end of the arc,\nhis hair is grown out into a spiky style. However, it turns back to a buzzcut.\nHe gains a scar after fighting\nGun\nthat stretches from his cheek to his lip (in the game, he does not possess a scar).\nHe gained another scar across his nose when he fought\nXiaolong\nin the 3rd Affiliate arc.",
        "personality": "Jake is a charming and charismatic individual who, initially, is polite to everyone he meets. He is able to win Jiho's trust easily and his accomplice Jiho mistakes him for a friend, until he reminds him that they are business partners. During the Jake Kim Arc it is revealed his disdain for gangs because of his relationship to his father whom Jake described as a gang leader known for being just and fair to others but unfair to his own family.\nDuring his middle school years he is laid back and doesn't care about being the leader of the school. Ironically, like his father he is someone who will not tolerate injustices and unfairness demonstrated when he fought the third years for \"ganging up\" on Brad and Jason when they were in middle school and fighting\nSamuel Seo\nto help the vendors of the street Big Deal is protecting.\nTo his allies, Jake is a caring leader. He fought hard to maintain Big Deal's independence, and they care about him deeply, making them one of the most loyal crews. He values people who are honest and fair, and does not like people who fight dirty.\nDuring the series Jake noted himself that he began to sound like\nSinu Han\n, the previous leader of Big Deal who showed Jake the value of \"romance\" and passion, and ideals which the latter follow.\nFollowing his time in juvenile detention, Jake's personality began to change. He became callous to his initial ideas about fairness and is only focused on revenge.\nAs of the\nOne Night II Arc\n, his sense of humor that he used to have in his past resurfaces. He makes some sneeze jokes, shows his butt to\nVivi\n, and plays word chain with\nJohan Seong\nand\nDaniel Park\nwhile on duty as an undercover bouncer for Vivi's club. However, he still has his serious demeanor at the ready whenever he needs to, as he is looking for clues regarding Sinu Han's whereabouts.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Jake Kim is among the most proficient fighters in the series utilizing a fighting style based off of MMA and his father's , Gapyrong Kim's, street fighting style. He is extremely skilled in combat and the third person to defeat\nEuntae Lee\nin the Webtoon (the others being\nDaniel\nand Gun). This is a relevant fact in the early series as it established the superiority of the\nFour Major Crews.\nAlthough it may be argued that Daniel may be faster, Jake defeated Euntae, who as Daniel stated before, was the second to visibly injure Gun. He was able to defeat\nXiaolong\n, who was comparable to Gun in strength. And, as of chapter 388, blocked a kick from Sinu, who had \"Invisible\" kicks.\nIn the Hunt for Big Deal Arc, Jake held off (for a limited time) both Yuseong (an extremely powerful figure, as the Workers\nversion\nof Gun Park) and Xiaolong (who was stated by Jake in the\nWorkers\n: 3rd Affiliate Arc [who fought Gun in a brawl] and Old Face [who witnessed Gun 3 years back] to be on par with a\nsuppressed\nGun) | but Xiaolong only got stronger from there | (as so did Gun, who trains consistently to surpass himself every day [but hasn't engaged in many fights for a while] ), but still performed well (albeit on the losing end), and once Yuseong left, Jake adapted to Xiaolong's fighting style and ending up cornering him. A testament to his durability and endurance is that he survived a fall from a school building after taking heavy blows from the weapon wielding Xiaolong and pure destructive power (as stated by Johan) of Yuseong and still willed himself to push forward and push back the police to keep Big Deal safe.\nIn chapter 461, Taejin Cheon stated that Jake Kim was stronger than that of Jerry Kwon by the looks of the damaged and beaten responders. And in the same chapter he seems to be working with\nAllied\nin the first affiliation or is probably a member of it.\nThe full extent of his power is revealed in Chapter 469 when he faces off against\nJinyoung Park\n. After unlocking all the reserves of Gapryong's Blood/Genes, he now has both\nInnate Strength\nand completed the\nStage of Mastery\n.\nIt is theorized that his true limit was already demonstrated vs Samuel Seo in Chapter 466 but it is to be confirmed the difference between the two states: Unconscious and Conscious. There is more evidence towards the two being identical as Jake called back to the Samuel Fight and wished for the same power vs Jinyoung before being wired to activate it.",

        "relationships": "Family\nGapryong Kim\nJake has a bad relationship with his father, as his father was always a good man to the public, but a bad man to his family, especially his mother.\nBig Deal\nJerry Kwon\nJerry is Jake's second command. Jake is very kind to Jerry and often involved in his education he encouraged Jerry to be a modest student and to get along well with his classmates. He bought Jerry a bamboo flute so that he will not be reprimanded by his teachers and to practice the Jeongseon Arirang. Jerry is undeniably the most loyal member to Jake, he refuses to call anyone else \" Sir\" and will always follows Jake command without hesitation. He was known to be Jake's \"sword\" and when Jake lost to Gun he vowed to become stronger so that he can protect Jake.\nWorkers\nSamuel Seo\nSamuel and Jake have a rocky start, Samuel thought that Jake was acknowledged by the Big Boss of Big Deal because he personally sought Jake, whereas he was recruited by Big Deal second in command. After they were captured by Black Bear Gang where they were saved by Sinu Han the two began to acknowledge each other and become friends. When Samuel decided to go to Gangnam and start a gang there he recruited Jake to be his second in command but Jake refused, he told Samuel that he hated gangs and the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it is not a typical gang. During their conversation Jake told Samuel about his relationship with his father and his father's funeral, Samuel commented that big funerals are uncommon for most gangsters Jake told him the name of his father. Samuel was shocked and he began to despise Jake and their relationship become sour.\nWhile Jake is known to be a caring leader, Samuel is ruthless and often clashes with Jake. Especially when Samuel decided to support Old Face in joining the four major crews after Sinu lost to Gun. When he resorted on using the girls who work in clothing stores to earn money and punishing them by not giving them food or drinks, Jake decided to face him, the two fought and Samuel was left unconscious.\nDuring the fight Big Deal members as well as Gun thought that Samuel is vengeful towards Jake because he is the illegitimate son of Gapryong Kim but it was later revealed that he was jealous of Jake because he wanted to be Gapryong Kim's son. He saw a picture of his mom and Gapryong Kim together and thought that it must be his father so he changed himself from being a timid and bullied boy to a strong character so that his father would be pleased to see him when they met. When he met his real father and realized that he was just mistaken Samuel was embarrassed to admit that the \"great\" father he thought he have is far different from reality. He becomes resentful of Jake because he is the real son of Gapryong Kim and he was acknowledged by people he respect mainly Gapryong, Sinu, and Gun.\nJ High School\nJiho Park\nJake initially did not think much of Jiho. He used Jiho in his illegal betting ring and stole his money. When Jiho came to prison, Jake gave Jiho advice on how to survive. After seeing how powerful Jiho had become, Jake decided that his advice worked, and accepted Jiho into Big Deal.\nOther\nJong Gun\nGun was the one who gave Jake a scar on his face and removed his teeth. Jake has sworn revenge on Gun, and decided to do anything possible to win.",
        "background": "Jake Kim used to be third in command to Big Deal, and the leader of the YB division. When the leader of Big Deal attempted to sell the gang to the Workers gang, he fought for their right to be independent. Since then, Jake has been the leader of Big Deal.\nHe also used to be the main candidate for Gun's successor, and was tasked with uniting the four crews. After he disobeyed Gun's rules by running an illegal betting ring (which, ironically, was what he was using to make money to become Gun's successor), Gun beat Jake and removed his candidacy.\nHis father, Gapryong Kim, was a famous gangster, who Jake disliked because of his father's neglectful treatment of his mother. The reason he joined Big Deal was because it was not like a typical gang.\nHowever, his resolve and views on his father change as he learns from his mother how Gapryong was incapable of ignoring others in need or injustices. This led Jake to confront Sinu and take up the role as Big Deal's leader after the former sold himself to\nWorkers\n.",
        "plot": "Illegal Toto Arc\nHe,\nJiho\n, and two others met to discuss the wildly popular ladder betting game. However, he was brought into prominence when\nEuntae\n, trying to help out Jiho, attempted to fight him in order to convince him to give Jiho his money back.\nJace Park\nattempted to convince Euntae not to fight after noticing that they were in \"Big Deal\" territory. However, this confrontation angered Jake, as he was insulted that Euntae thought that he would need his underlings. Euntae and Kim immediately begin to fight, and Euntae was later shown bleeding and utterly defeated. As Bum Jae was going to step in and fight himself, Gun arrives on the scene. After being informed that he was no longer a candidate for Gun's successor, Jake reveals that Gun runs an extortion ring, which angers him. Gun then proceeds to brutally defeat Jake, ripping out his teeth as a punishment for his insubordination.\nJuvenile Prison (Arc)\nLater, Jake is shown in a Juvenile Detention Center, vowing to himself that he will kill Gun. He is a major influence to Jiho and tells him that the only way he will win against opponents stronger than himself is if he resorts to fighting to the death. He later reveals that this advice was not meant for Jiho but for himself, as he believes the only way he will win against Gun is if he fights him to the death.\nJake Kim (Arc)\nThis is a flashback arc and takes place a few years before the start of the series.\nJake is the unofficial leader of his middle school. When second year transfer students\nBrad Lee\nand\nJason Yoon\nare ganged up on by the third years, Jake steps in and beats all of the third years because he liked the gum they gave him. Later, Jake is directly contacted by the leader of\nBig Deal\n, Sinu Han and is invited to join the gang. Jake refuses, stating his dislike of gangsters.\nSamuel Seo\nfinds out that Sinu contacted Jake personally and not him, and goes to beat Jake to prove his strength. Jake and Samuel fight in a street that Big Deal protects. In the middle of their fight, the Black Bear Gang shows up and threatens them. Samuel, Jake, Brad, Jason,\nJerry Kwon\nand\nAlexander Hwang\ntell the gang that they are Big Deal. The Black Bear members chase them down and capture them. Before the Black Bears can kill them, Sinu shows up to save them. He asks the leader of the Black Bears if he can handle the repercussions of killing the leader of Big Deal. He lets the boys go, and Sinu is shown visibly shaking afterwards, although the boys now have a great deal of respect for him.\nSinu celebrates saving them with a feast on the aforementioned street. Samuel is eager to join, but Jake is still reluctant to join Big Deal. He comes back later and joins along with Brad, Jason and Jerry, likely due to Sinu breaking his preconceptions of what a gangster was."

        "personality": "Jerry's main character trait is his undying loyalty to Jake. Jerry sees Jake as a brother, becoming known as Jake's sword for this reason. In the Eli Jang arc, he is shown to be honest, honoring Warren's desire to leave the rest of Hostel alone. Other members of Big Deal respect Jerry greatly for his character, but Jake seems to have changed his mind about Jerry at the end of the Juvenile Detention arc, deeming him \"too simple\".",

        "fighting_prowess": "Jerry's fighting style is to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength. Described as Jake's mighty sword, Jerry's sheer size and strength is so immense that he was able to shrug off attacks from multiple members of the Monstar crew without notice. He also has lots of experience in fighting given his battle against numerous crews. Jerry doesn't seem to back off in a fight regardless of how injured he becomes and also doesn't dodge an attack when he can; this is seen as a weakness by Gun. Jerry is also shown to hold back his full strength whenever he is in a fight near Jake.\nAfter his fight with Gun, he decided to never lose another fight again and learned Boxing as a martial art to help.\nAlso in the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Jerry was shown to have an 'enraged' mode where he stopped holding back entirely and pushed Mandeok Bang extremely far and to push Mandeok to use moves against Jerry that he didn't use against Tom Lee",

        "synopsis": "Jichang Kwak was the King of Seoul during the 1st Generation, and was likely to have been financially successful, as he presumably owned high-rise property and was willing to compensate\nJaegyeon Na\nfor his damaged car. Prior to cheonliang arc as per gapryong Kim's disciple jinrang and jichang have met where jichang told him to stop being a dog and become a alpha greatly helping jinrang. Seonji yuk was present\nDuring the\nCheonliang Arc\n, Jichang , along with the other Kings, appeared in Cheonliang after receiving a \"signal\" from\nSeongji Yuk\n[\n1\n]\n. Upon realising that Seongji had been maimed by\nShinmyung Cheon\n, Jichang became incensed and decided to fight the\nGhostly\nBrothers\n. Although it appeared that he was struggling against them at first, he revealed that he was actually observing them due to their notoriety, but found that they had failed to meet his expectations. Deeming that there was \"no need to even come up with a strategy\", Jichang easily defeated the Ghostly Brothers\n[\n2\n]\n.\nJichang and the other Kings then shifted their attention to James Lee, blaming him for his role in defeating Seongji which led to his brutal fate. As the exhausted and injured James fled, Jichang demonstrated his cerebral prowess by steering him towards Jaegyeon. However, James still managed to escape. Before his departure, Jichang asked James what he and his ally, Charles Choi, were planning, to which James only gave an ominous reply, telling the Kings that he would visit them again soon\n[\n3\n]\n.\nLater on, Jichang was ousted from the city by Gitae Kim and exiled to Chungcheong-do, where he began to work as a police officer in an official capacity. With his brothers and Bakgu Noh, Jichang quietly lived for years in the countryside. Jichang was \"indebted\" to Bakgu Noh, and aligned himself with\nJinyeong Park\n, committing himself to helping Bakgu in his pursuit for justice\n[\n4\n]\n.\nAt some point, Jichang was visited and defeated in battle by James Lee, who expressed disappointment in the state of the former King of Seoul. Feeling sorry for him, James spared Jichang from having a body part taken away, as was the fate of the other defeated Kings\n[\n5\n]\n.\nWhen Daniel Park came to Chungcheong during the\nHolidays 2 Arc\n, Jichang was alerted when Daniel came to the police station and asked for information about Jinyeong Park. Believing Daniel to be working for Charles Choi, Jichang immediately ordered for Daniel to be dealt with quietly by his subordinates, including his brothers. However, Jichang was eventually confronted by Daniel, who saw through his plan and realised that the unassuming police officer was the King of Chungcheong\n[\n6\n]\n.\nInitially underestimating Daniel, Jichang said that he wouldn't \"even raise a hand against\" Daniel. He was soon proven wrong when Daniel landed multiple hits on him, and the two began to fight. Having the upper hand at first, Jichang was overpowered temporarily by Daniel who had entered his \"self-loathing mode\". As Daniel had brought up James Lee's name, Jichang decided to use his signature hand blades against Daniel, overwhelming Daniel and nearly defeating him, if not for the interference of\nhis\nallies\n[\n5\n]\n.\nWith Daniel copying James Lee's abilities to attack him, Jichang chose to demonstrate his superior strength and speed, and dealt serious blows onto Daniel to the point where he was pushed into his\nUltra Instinct\nstate. Knowing that there was no longer room for leeway, Jichang went for an extremely strong strike on the charging Daniel. However, before either of their hits could connect, Bakgu Noh stepped in to end the fight, having recognised Daniel as a relative of Jinyeong Park\n[\n7\n]\n.\nAfter the skirmish, Jichang apologises to Daniel about having sent his men to attack Daniel and his friends. Jichang reveals that he has been laying low in Chungcheong for years to help out Bakgu, whom he refers to respectfully as \"Mr Noh\". Before Daniel's departure for Jinyeong's location, Daniel asks for his help in Seoul, recognising Jichang's strength. Both Bakgu and Jichang are impressed by this gesture, although Jichang rejects the offer and promises that once he has settled his matters in Chungcheong, he will lend Daniel his strength.\nSoon after Daniel leaves, Jichang discusses with Bakgu their plans to take down Charles Choi, having sent Daniel away to avoid involving him in the conflict. Jichang and Bakgu sends evidence of Charles' involvement in the infamous\nGapryong Kim\nmurder case to a media outlet later that day, hoping that this would finally bring justice.\nThat night, however, Charles appears in Chungcheong, revealing that the media outlet in question was actually controlled by him. Having located Bakgu, one of the final obstacles in his way, Charles intends to kill Bakgu, but this attempt on his life is stopped by Jichang's appearance. Aware that both of them would be unable to defeat the legendary fighter, Jichang sends Bakgu away to spread the evidence of Charles' guilt himself, while keeping Charles' attention on him\n[\n4\n]\n.\nRejecting offers to become his bodyguard, Jichang and Charles engage in a full-on fight, with Charles recognising the danger that he is in, not only due to Jichang's exceptional strength and speed, but his battle strategies. With Jichang seemingly defeated, Charles approaches Jichang to kill him. Unexpectedly, Jichang draws his revolver on Charles.\nUnfortunately, Charles is able to disarm him and gains control of the gun, landing a fatal shot on Jichang's abdomen. When Bakgu returns back to the cabin, Jichang attempts to warn Bakgu of Charles' hidden presence to no avail, leading to Charles shooting and killing Bakgu as well.\nAfter the incident, Charles Choi manipulated the scene and media to hide the truth, framing Bakgu for attempting to steal Jichang's gun and both being killed in the scuffle. Although his brothers were unwilling to believe the story portrayed by the media, the truth of the matter was only revealed to them by Daniel, who had correctly deduced that Charles Choi was behind the double murder.\nJichang's funeral was held in Chungcheong and had a large amount of mourners, many of whom were members of the First Generation, including the Kings. Finding that the circumstances of the case to be suspicious, some of the Kings have begun investigating the issue, while Jichang's brothers, Jibeom and Jihan Kwak have joined forces with Daniel Park to seek revenge on Charles Choi\n[\n8\n].",
        "fighting_prowess": "Like the other 1st Generation Kings, Jichang Kwak specially trained a signature move, that being his hand chops which he calls \"The Hand Blade\". A single Hand Blade has the power to break a safe, the blow itself having a similar Attack Potency to\nTaesoo Ma\n, making him one of the strongest members of the\n1st Generation\nin terms of Attack Power and Speed.\nIn terms of intelligence, Jichang was presented as possessing such an aptitude for strategy that he was able to successfully get a hit against Charles Choi. And was even acknowledged by Gitae Kim during their duel.\nIn the\npast\n, Jichang was praised by James Lee to be a extremely intelligent fighter.",
        "relationships": "Charles Choi\nJichang desired the fall of Charles and actively assisted the Pre-Generation Bakgu Noh in carrying out a plan to get revenge on Charles. When Charles discovered their location, Jichang held him off, eventually being able to manipulate the situation so that he would be able to get a shot off on Charles with his gun, a strategy that ultimately failed.\nBakgu Noh\nAfter Jichang's retirement, he became committed to helping Bakgu get his revenge on Charles Choi, even going so far as to attempt to hold Charles off so Bakgu could secure the evidence that served as Charles' weak point. In the end, this attempt failed as Bakgu was lured back to the scene and killed by Charles Choi, Jichang himself dying soon after.\nAfter the pair's deaths, Charles framed Bakgu for being responsible for the incident, the official story being that Bakgu attacked Jichang, who struggled to take the gun from Bakgu, before the gun went off, ending in both being killed.",
        "trivia": "According to\nCharles Choi\n, one of the things that sets Jichang apart from the other Kings is his superior strength and speed, the second being that he is a tactician.\nJichang used to be the King of Seoul, but he was usurped and exiled to Chungcheong-do by Jake Kim's half-brother. Regarding this fact, James Lee mentions that Jichang was crushed by that man.\nWhen Jichang was exiled to Chungcheong-do, he defeated and drove out the original King of Chungcheong. The existence of this King is only known from a brief mention by\nJames Lee\nin chapter 438 when he says \"The original King of Chungcheong did nothing wrong.\""

He was easily and effortlessly overpowering a post Alexander Sophia training Jay Hong during their fight, but it should also been known that Jay Hong was trying to put a helmet on Jihan's head for his Kali Arnis and only using Systema. While his Hand-Blade style is exceptionally powerful as it almost knocked out Jay Hong, he isn't an idiot and knows that the Hand-Blades can only get him so far, so his true fighting style is a more street like fighting style that involves kicks, punches, knees and elbows. Surprisingly with his scarred up build he has great durability and endurance as he could take every Systema attack used against him by Jay and even overpowered the Systema using Jay Hong and was about to kill him before Jay distracted him and used Kali Arnis. While Jihan did survive the onslaught of attacks used by Jay Hong and could have kept on fighting he accepted his defeat (indicating that he is honorable) and wished his enemy (at that time) luck on the fight ahead.He is still definitely above Jay without weapons as he is shown to overpower Jay in hand to hand combat and is smart enough to take on Hudson and Vin Jin without much difficulty if he uses his battle IQ which ranks him higher. Also keep note that he didn't go all out against Jay which was the same case for Jay but is still debatable.",

Jake grabs Jiho and yells at him to get it together, and that Jiho should have never left prison without taking care of his condition. He asks Jiho who he met in prison, and Jiho runs away. Worried about him, Jake sends two of his men after Jiho.\nJake talks to Brad and Jason about Jiho.

A Big Deal member comes in to tell Jake they've found Jiho, but there's a problem. Daniel Park and the detective run to a building where Jiho is on the roof, talking to someone. At some point, Jiho falls off the roof and Daniel fails to catch him.\nAt Jiho's funeral his parents weep for him.

When he was sitting with\nDuke\nand\nDaniel\noutside of the convenience store, he started smoking to try to look cooler than them, saying that he had smoked many times; despite it actually being his first. He also bought a lot of expensive brands and limited items for the same reason.\nHe was power-hungry and obsessed with status, proceeding to take many dangerous actions simply to climb up the social hierarchy.

        "name": "Lang Jin",
        "appearance": "Lang Jin appears to be a tall and muscular man in either his late twenties or early thirties. He has sunken black eyes, scruffy black hair with a short goatee accompained by a moustache, as well a unusual scar below his left eye that resembles scales. Upon his release from prison, he is shown wearing a black polo shirt under a dark gray business suits and black pants (he occasionally wears a white shirt instead). He also wears golden-yellow rings on both hands that read 'Busan' and 'Purgatory'. After his fight against Kitae Kim, Lang permanently lost his left arm after having it get chopped off by the former King. His trademark part of his appareance is the large tattoo on his back shaped like a realistic wolf head.",
        "personality": "An unwanted person since birth, without even having a name, Lang Jin grew up being raised to never disobey those at the top of the hierarchy and to obey them like a dog. Thus, Lang in the past was someone without any ambition or prospects for growth in life, doing the minimum to live and the possible to protect Jungseok Hwang and Sang Baek, who he considers his little brothers. For a long time, Lang maintained this lifestyle and thinking, until he heard Jichang Kwak's scolding, which made him realize that his lack of ambition and perspective kept him hostage to fate, which also affected his little brothers. After that, he fights against Dayoung Oh, ceasing to be a dog and consolidating himself as the \"Wolf\". Later, Lang extends his protective personality to all of Busan. And after returning from prison, he shows great hatred towards James Lee and anyone who threatens Busan or his family. He is also very charismatic, and not without mercy, such as his fight against Gongseob Ji, he showed mercy when the latter was down and unable to get back up. He is also a capable leader, being able to boost the positive energy within the people of Busan after he defeated the previous King of Busan; gaining the respect of all of Busan's people.",
        "fighting_prowess": "As the first champion of the Busan underworld and one of the kings of the 1st Generation, Lang Jin is one of the strongest characters in the series, being feared and respected throughout Busan. He easily took down two members of the Allies with just one blow each without them having time to react, applying enough force to dent a steel container and open a crater in a concrete floor with the force of his blows. He is powerful enough to fight simultaneously against the kings of Daegu and Ansan, having the upper hand for most of the fight by withstanding their strongest attacks without faltering while inflicting heavy damage on them. He was so powerful that even Daniel Park had to use the fighting style of the former King of Seoul. Despite being in his perfect body fighting against Jinrang - who was injured by the previous fight against two kings of the 1st Generation, Daniel still proved to be inferior in an exchange of blows with the King of Busan, who surpassed him in both strength and endurance. Using the Gapryong Kim Style, he can wield the rare Mastery of Conviction, which allows him to surpass his limits with his strong will to protect those he cares about, even delivering very powerful and destructive punches capable of destroying the strongest defenses and even overcoming users of the Mastery of Resistance and inflicting critical damage. Lang Jin, even injured and tired from previous fights, managed to remain conscious after an attack by Gitae Kim and after witnessing the death of his foster brothers Baek and Hwang to protect him, Lang reached a new level of \"Conviction\" represented by the intense purple glow in his eyes and his scar that increased his strength, speed and resistance to the point of pressuring and even forcing Gitae to keep his guard up to protect himself from his attacks that were hurting him and making him bleed, something that none of the other characters in the work managed to do. The power of his punches were so strong that the bones in his arms were beginning to break with each blow exerting a force greater than his body could withstand.",
        "wolf_style": "Lang Jin's fighting style consists of using his elbows to fight in close quarters for both offense and defense, being compared to \"fangs\" being able to cut and inflict serious damage to the Kings of Daegu and Ansan and easily block most of their attacks.",
        "gapryong_kim_style": "Lang Jin's true strength lies in his fists. As a former disciple of Gapryong Kim, he learned from him his techniques and fighting style, which consisted of charging his fists with Conviction: the desire to protect. His punches were so powerful that with just one blow he was able to knock out the King of Daegu in a counterattack. Even Daniel Park's copying ability proven to be ineffective when he tried to copy this style, as he only replicated the movements but not the \"Conviction\" behind the punches, which led to Lang describing them as \"Empty Fists\". At the height of his fight against Gitae, Jirang reached a new level of \"Conviction\" that surpassed all his limits where his punches became so powerful that the bones in his hand broke with the impact of his blows that pressured Gitae to raise his guard to protect himself as they were capable of injuring him and making him bleed.",

Park Jin and their boss - Mr. Jang - took her aside to see her in person. Park Jin offered to support her completely if she would date him.

She claimed and proved that she had actually recorded Park Jin's offer and said that she'll give up the recording if let Aru go. But the brothers found a way to cheat through the agreement and trapped them to get the recording and delete it. Lasol and the group were surrounded by men recruited by Park Jin to beat them up. But Jong Gun and Joon Goo showed up and along with Daniel Park and Vasco defeated all of them (though Gun and Goo were fighting each other). The HNH Group CEO showed up and with DG's help dismissed Mr Jang as the CEO of PTJ Entertainment.

He is also tall, at 190 cm (6\u20193\u201d) and became even taller later, making him one of the tallest characters in Lookism, possibly to make him more intimidating as an antagonist. He has black hair that stands up abnormally. Logan is usually seen with a bored face due to nothing entertaining him, such as a fight. Most of the time, he is seen either looking down upon those who are weak or glaring angrily at males who are considered attractive. He has a signature scowl of belittlement and judgment on his face when being called out. Due to his large size, his neck barely tapers to give a depth of his head to shoulder ratio. Logan is usually seen wearing a black tiger shirt with a loose white dress shirt and slim black jeans. Oftentimes, he prefers not to wear his black shirt and leaves his dress shirt loose to expose the tattoos on his body. He has a tattoo of Buddha on his stomach and a carp on his right arm. His back and the rest of his body are covered with tattoos in a wing-like pattern. After being rejected by Zoe, Logan was heartbroken and trapped himself within his room for a long time eventually losing a lot of weight and became very thin. Thin Logan is deemed quite attractive, as girls would stare at him in infatuation as he walked by. His tattoos looked different when he lost weight: his Buddha tattoo appeared as Gandhi, while the carp on his right arm appeared as small as a sardine fish. He did not maintain this look for long. Once he realized he was now attractive, he tried to use his looks to get to Zoe but was rejected again. This caused him to reason power and strength was greater than romance and binge eat his weight back.",
        "personality": "Logan is a hateful person who will beat up anybody, including women. However, when he entered the animation department, he realized that he couldn't bully them because they all appeared to him as sheep. Logan has a narcissistic attitude and is accompanied by his large, intimidating stature. He is always shown as the leader in the group at his old middle school prior to J High School. Due to his hunger for blood and violence, he is known to transfer out of many schools. Logan has a habit of not having people to look down on him, which makes him start up fights. He has demonstrated his cruel behavior, when he attempted to break Vasco's leg after getting him into a leg lock. He has a hatred towards women and attractive men due to his poor experiences within middle school. Because of this, he has no sympathy in inflicting pain on either man or woman.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Logan is immensely powerful and strong, able to beat three upperclassmen who were twice his size. He has a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience when it comes to fighting. Logan is powerful in all areas (speed, strength, technique, and power), but his defense is most likely the most significant and distinguished factor which Logan, as an individual, is overwhelmingly best at. Logan has a body that is perfect for any way of fighting he chooses but focuses most on power and strength since his body allows him to deliver blows with immense strength. Despite his huge stature, Logan is capable of moving at incredible speeds. He was even able to surprise Zack (a fighter well known for his speed) with a lightning-quick tackle that won him the fight. Even a tactical approach that focuses on technique is possible for Logan due to his experience in fighting. Best of all is his unbelievable endurance, which is one of the most impressive shows to date. Logan was able to fight 3 of the Jae Won high's top fighters all in one day with no desire to back down. He is able to endure hard jabs and punches, seen when he took multiple shots to the face from Zack without inflicting serious damage. Logan has exceptional knowledge over wrestling and demonstrated it in when he tackled Zack after transferring to J High School. One of his signature fighting tactics is to jab his targets straight into the solar plexus. He has demonstrated this many times to Daniel, Zack, Vasco, and Vin Jin. When he had decided to lose weight Logan was faster than Zack Lee but had none of the endurance and strength he once had, thus becoming a punching bag for the entire school. As noted by Goo during the Hostel Arc Logan has the ability to adapt to one's fighting style, especially if it is weapon oriented, this combined with his jiu-Jitsu, emphasis on dogfighting, his reliance and use of weaponry made him a true monster. In fact, his endurance is so strong he can even fully recharge his stamina after 30 minutes of rest.",

Though he realized how wonderful it is to be handsome and be able to influence others, he also became aware of how weak he has become. Despite being more attractive to Zoe, he was rejected for his attitude and returned with an even bigger weight and bigger tendency for violence. He has an incredible sense of technique, that combined with immense power and size makes him one of the most prominent fighters in the story. Whilst he has held his own against the likes of Vasco, Vin, Jay, Daniel, and Zack; the only fight that he has presumably lost was against Goo. During the Stalker Arc, Goo was seen confronting him due to Lee beating up multiple seniors who were collecting money from the lowerclassmen students, which caused trouble to Gun and Goo's business. Logan later stated that Goo almost broke his shoulder during their fight, and was seen with several bruises and marks on his face in the aftermath when Logan was told that he was transferring schools Logan is often described as a bear on peak of food chain.

He tells Daniel that if a teacher came, Daniel had to use his fat body to stop him. he tells Daniel to act like Pikachu to amuse himself, and puts his wet shoe to Daniel's face to kick him into the urinal. In the classroom, he nails Daniel in the stomach. His friend laughs with him because he made Daniel faint. Daniel abruptly gets up when he is told to imitate Pikachu, and he imitates Pikachu's thunderbolt move on command. Upon request, he lets his friend borrow Daniel for the day to deliver a gift for a 100th day anniversary. Pavlov's Dog Arc He fights Daniel and loses. Troubled Transfer Arc He enters to bathroom, mumbling \"watashiwa\" to himself because the class he was in kept repeating it. Jin Vin and the others in the bathroom hear him and make fun of him for it, and they say he must have been from the comics department. Jin Vin licks his finger and rubs it on one of Logan's tattoos. Logan asks if he was trying to start something, and Jin Vin just laughs at him, not taking the threat seriously. Jin Vin attempts to spin Logan onto the floor, but Logan grabs him and headbutts him instead. Jin Vin's glasses break and he covers his eyes. Jay-gal Gong sees how Logan took down Jin Vin and is shocked that someone in his department would have skill. Logan tries to move Jin Vin's eyes away to see his face, but Jin Vin is stubborn and refuses to let anyone see. Teachers come before Logan can finish. Logan goes out the window before he can get caught, and the teachers only see Jin Vin, his two friends, and a broken window. Jay-gal Gong later goes to Logan and asks to be his friend. Logan slaps him and tells him to avert his eyes. He then stands up and tells everyone not to step out of line, or else they'll be crushed. Jay-gal happily thinks that the comics department could rise. He offers Logan a box f apple juice later in the day, and while Logan thinks that he's annoying, he might also be useful to have around. Jay-gal sees Zack around, and he gets the idea of starting a fight between Zack and Logan. Logan ends up angry at Zack, and he pours food on Mira. Once Zack had made sure Mira was alright, he throws the first fist at Logan. Logan ends up tackling Zack to the ground and Zack screams, alerting Vasco. In the cafeteria, Mira returns and steps in front of Zack to defend him. Logan grabs the girl's hair, but Zack gets up and punches him from under the jaw. Before Zack and Logan can get back into their fight, Vasco grabs Logan's shoulder and tells them not to fight. He squeezes Logan's shoulder and Logan falls to the ground. Jin Vin also returns in a new pair of goggles, and he steps into the door and demands a rematch from Logan. In the end, Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin all challenge Logan to fight. Logan comments that the three are a balance of technique, strength, and speed. He thinks that the school is fun. He takes off his shirt and tells all of them to bring it on. This moment was Logan's debut at the new school. Daniel shivers as he remembers how Logan bullied him at his old school. Jay glances at Logan, who was the cause of Daniel's shaking. Daniel goes to the nurse for his shaking. Later, Daniel and Logan are on opposite sides of the door to the nurse, and they are about to open it. First Love Arc Logan Lee tells Daniel to get out of his way when he walks into the door. He doesn't recognize Daniel, but gets instantly angry at him when Zoe tries to get close to Daniel. He grabs Daniel by the shoulder and is surprised to see that Daniel doesn't immediately collapse. He thinks to himself that Daniel was stronger than Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin. Daniel kneels regardless because it was conditioned in him to kneel down to Logan. Logan is confused and wonders if Daniel was faking it. Zoe demands that Logan let him go. He thinks that the girls in the school were also very brave. Logan tells her to get lost, and that she only cared about whether or not a guy had a nice face. Zoe yells out loud that she liked \"the piggy\", and that makes Logan release Daniel. He looks at Zoe and tells her that she was crazy and leaves. He doesn't believe that she would like Daniel in his original body. After the incident, Logan can't stop thinking about Zoe. He decides that if he confesses, she would return his feelings because he was more attractive than back then. When he turns the corner, he overhears Zoe saying that she was lying about liking Daniel's first body, which was a lie. However, he believes it and changes his mind about confessing. He cries on the bench instead and chooses to miss school. He misses school for a month and only returns when Jay-gal calls him. He lost a considerable amount of weight and looks handsome according to the girls. Logan enters the comics classroom, and a few girls watch him go in. After class, he thinks that people used to look at him in disgust, but now they looked at him in fondness. He goes behind a wall to smoke. The girls who were watching him catch up to him and ask him for a cigar. He tells them to leave him alone and they swoon, thinking he's playing hard to get. He gets extremely confused by their flirting. He goes into the bathroom to examine himself. He says the carp tattoo on his arm changed into an anchovy and the buddha on his stomach into a gandhi. Two guys make fun of him, but instantly apologize after he glares at them. The two guys don't recognize him anymore. He thinks that his world had completely changed, even though he didn't act differently he was treated differently. Logan thinks that he could now confess to Zoe because he became handsome. He doesn't see her, but he sees Mira. He drapes his arm around her because he thinks she'd like him, but Zack throws a bottle of Coke at him. Zack no longer recognizes him. Logan starts by tackling Zack in the same hold, and happily thinks that he has gotten much faster because he is so light. However, he is unable to lift Zack up anymore so Zack punches him in the jaw and he is much more strongly affected than before. His fighting style no longer suited his new figure. He uncounters Jin Vin in the hall who also doesn't remember him and gets knocked out. When he wakes up, Vasco, who doesn't remember him either tries to help him up.Logan threatens him and Vasco sighs. He walks away with Jace when his help is refused. Jay-gal says that Logan no longer looks like a master. They fight, and Logan struggles to beat Jay-gal, although he could usually win without effort. He continues to try to find Zoe, but a classmate says she is sick. He peers inside a classroom and sees a familiar head, mistaking Crystal for Daniel's original body. He says \"Pikachu\" out loud. Logan walks up to Crystal, and only then does he realize that it is not Daniel. She insults him, and he lifts his hand up to slap her, but is grabbed by Daniel. This starts a fight between Daniel and Logan. Daniel dodges every punch that Logan throws. He uses a \"body blow\", taught indirectly by Logan to beat him. Logan is left on the ground as Daniel leads Crystal away. Zoe finally appears at school and she helps him up. He asks for her number and she gives it to him. Zoe thinks that he is extremely handsome. They go out for juice, and Logan asks her out, but she declines. She says it's because she hated his personality. She then leaves because she sees Daniel's original body. Logan passes out from shame. He returns to school bigger and more violent than before. He no longer values being handsome. Daniel Park Arc A group of God Dogs see him and asks him if he knew of the Burn Knuckles. Zoe seems him afterwards and puts a pink band-aid on his knuckles when she sees that they are bleeding. Zoe somehow still does not remember him. He then remembers how she said she liked Daniel's original body, and that leads him to the conclusion that Zoe liked him because she liked pigs. He passes by an alley of beat up people. He picks one up and asks the person whether he's handsome or ugly, and gets inconclusive results. Logan tries to find Zoe. He sees her at the convenience store that Daniel worked in and looms over the window threateningly. He is surprised to see his past slave. He drags Daniel into an alley and beat him. He asks if Daniel had slept with Zoe, and Daniel says that he wasn't dating her. Logan then takes out his phone and tells Daniel to give him Zoe's number. When Daniel refuses, he is beat up more by Logan. Zoe sees them and throws her shoe at Logan. She defends Daniel, and Logan walks away in defeat. However, he goes back to the store at night and beats Daniel and takes his phone. He finds Zoe's number in it. Using Daniel's phone, he lures Zoe to a playground. He continues using Daniel's phone to text Zoe. The next day, he tells Daniel to get Zoe to the rodeo. That night, he wears fresh clothes and has a bouquet of red flowers. Someone taps him on the back and he thinks that it's Zoe, but it's the same group of God Dogs from before. Logan ends up fighting again against the God Dogs.",

        "synopsis": "is a character in Lookism. She is a student in the fashion department of Jae Won High School , as well as Zack Lee's love interest and one of Daniel's friends.\nBackground Zack Lee , Johan Seong and Mira had known each other since they were little. The two boys had been in love with her ever since they were young, but Mira never seemed to directly reciprocate. Mira had met Johan in a church she used to attend regularly and thus they became friends. She is still somewhat religious, as she prayed before a meal during lunch. She seems to come from a well off family.\nChapter 2 Mira meets Daniel on the streets after Daniel in his original body, had just gotten a haircut. Daniel thought his haircut had made him very handsome, but he just looked like Kim Jong-un. When Daniel finds Mira looking at him, he thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her. Zack sees Daniel smile at Mira and thinks he's propositioning her. He confronts Daniel, and may have gotten into a fight if Mira had not steered him away, telling him not to act aggressively in public. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behaviour. Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders took pictures and uploaded them online.\nChapter 4 On the first day of school, bullies are forcing Jiho to fan a magazine up and down because of the heat. When an unattractive girl tells them to stop because she was getting cold, the bullies laugh at her. However, when Mira asks them to stop, the bullies stop immediately.\nChapter 5 When Zack goes to the convenience store where Daniel works at night, he is upset because he thinks Mira is attracted to Daniel in his new body. It was also revealed that Chapter 2 was Zack's date with Mira. Moreover, Zack had asked Mira out, but she had refused. Zack was so mad that he beat Daniel in his original body up.\nChapter 6 When Zack's friends show off the picture of Daniel and compliment Zack's speed, Zack tells them that he isn't proud of hitting Daniel even though he actually wants them to speak up louder so Mira would hear. He thinks that Mira would think he is cool for being very strong. Instead, Mira says that he hates the way Zack fights all the time. She explains that in Chapter 2 Zack had invited her to the movies only to get into a fight (with Daniel). The girl chatting with Mira tells her that Zack used to be a rising boxer in middle school.\nWhen Zack's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jae Yeol, Zack's friends, Mira, and Ha Neul look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.\nGhost Lady Mira had forgotten her cell phone, and Zack was accompanying her to school to retrieve it when they bumped into Vasco and Bum Jae, scaring Mira. When Zack asks what's so scary about coming to school, Mira tells him of the story of the Ghost Lady, who prowls through the school on rainy days in search of her lost children. It turns out that Vasco was there to find the Ghost Lady because he wanted her to grant him a wish that people wouldn't call him stupid anymore. Zack, trying to look cool in front of Mira, makes fun of Vasco's superstition, only for Bum Jae to dare him to sign his name on the glass frame surrounding the portrait. Mira, Bum Jae and Vasco waits for him in the classroom. When he returns, he tries to look brave in front of Mira. The next morning, Mira, Daniel, Vasco and Jace go to check out the signature only to find it on the window instead of on the portrait. Zack faints and wets his pants. In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.\nZack's Babysitting Diaries Zack dresses up to meet Mira. When Mira greets him, she is holding a kid and Zack is horrified because he thinks that the kid is Mira's. Mira smacks him and tells Zack that the kid wasn't hers, and she just found the kid alone. She said the kid must've gotten lost. She and Zack take the kid to the police. The police station is closed for an emergency dispatch. Mira tells Zack they have to split up so that Mira can take the subway to get to the police while Zack should wait at the cafe in case the kid's parents show up. Zack ends up taking the kid instead, growing attached to her. He names the kid \"Zami\" as a ship name for Zack and Mira. Zack lets the kid walk on her own and the kid walks out the train without Zack. Zack frantically looks for her at the next stop, but he can't find her and panics. Mira thankfully happens to find the girl on her way to Zack. They walk through the city and it is about sunset. Zack leans over and brushes the hair out of Mira's eyes and Mira smiles at him. Two guys start exit a building, speaking curse words and smoking. Zack covers Mira's nose with his hands and tells her not to breathe in the smoke. He also tells her not to look at the trash on the ground, laugh too much, and attempts to protect her from the wind. Mira is exasperated by the treatment. Zack and Mira eat before they enter the police station. They deliver the kid over to a cop and Mira sweatdrops over Zack's happiness when he hears the kid call him \"papa.\"",

In many chapters, she is shown wearing her school uniform; but when she is not wearing her school uniform, she tends to wear nice and fashionable clothes, which sometimes tend to be pink. Mira used to wear her hair in two braids in the earlier chapters but later changed her signature hairstyle into a bun.",

As she gets upset when Zack gets into fights, she is part of the reason why Zack has stopped acting aggressively. She is kind, caring and helpful. She is also very observant, as can be seen when she noticed that Zack was getting repeatedly upset in the Sports Day as he could not beat Daniel in any of the events. She enjoys studying in the library. Mira is also very innocent and someone who does not judge people quickly. She has a habit of repeatedly giving people chances, which is shown when she still trusted Jasmine Huh even after she framed Vasco.",

Zack and Mira care about each other a lot and often spend time with each other. Mira dislikes when Zack fights in public or makes a scene, often pulling him away from the conflict and scolding him for it later. When the two of them go to the library together later, Zack promises not to fight that day, but ends up getting into a conflict with a group of bullies at the library who decide to pick on him and eat the Honey BBQ chips Zack brought to give to Mira, which are her favorite. He lets it go at the insistence of Mira, but ends up fighting the leader of the group when he gropes Mira. Mira is a little upset that Zack didn't keep his promise, but later that night in a text she hints that she is happy he defended and protected her and that she forgives him. Daniel Park When Daniel first met her in his original body, he thought she was flirting with him when she smiles at him. Actually, she was only trying to apologize for Zack's aggressive behaviour. She is friendly with Daniel in his new body, and is part of the friend group that he hangs out with. Jasmine Huh Mira gave Jasmine another chance and is very friendly with her, despite of the fact that she framed Vasco. She tries to help her whenever she can and she is not aware that Jasmine actually uses her and her friendship. Friend Johan Seong Johan is Mira's and Zack's childhood friend. She and Johan attended the same church. Johan also has a crush on Mira. They were tight friends. Mira was upset when Johan slowly distanced himself away from her. She tried to make up for it by visiting his mother and his salon. She also prayed and hoped that they would continue to be close friends.",

Past In Mitsuki\u2019s flashback, she was the hostess of a casino after taking her father\u2019s legacy, who was an irresponsible man which made her despise him. Soon then, Vivi introduced her to Eugene and brought her to the 3rd affiliate, where it was still built for the underground fight club. When Eugene escorted Mitsuki into the building, he showed her the arena where there was a brawl going on, and that was where she met Sinu for the first time. Eugene explained Sinu\u2019s past after Mitsuki questioned about him, and she began to like him due to his ideal personality which was completely different from her father\u2019s. Not so long after, Mitsuki wanted to take Sinu with her, but Eugene refused because he belonged to Workers, which made her displeased. Eugene suddenly offered her a position as the head of the affiliate, and he would allow her to work with Sinu as in return, which she agreed eventually. Someday, Mitsuki got worried and ran to Sinu after the show, but he turned her down because he\u2019s not interested in her, saying he only followed her orders for the sake of his friends in Gangseo. Thus, she broke down in tears and demanded Eugene to brainwash him, so he came up with an idea of making a room that looks similar to the stores in Big Deal\u2019s area.

Prior to undergoing experimentation, he was a genuine and kind man, as well as an outstanding plastic surgeon who put people before money. Rather than taking patients who pursued superficial beauty, he only operated on patients who sustained injuries from accidents, even if it meant suffering financial loss. He also willingly volunteered to be the sole member on the staff of his father's Doctors for the Homeless program, where he endured horrible conditions to help the less fortunate. This kindness would be so intense that it led him to sacrifice his life in an attempt to save a few crippled men from death when the program's site began to fall apart.",

The younger brother saw him as a pathetic man in return, though he would realize he was fond of his older brother only after the accident.

        "name": "Old Face",
        "appearance": "Old Face is estimated to stand at 6'3\", with a gray buzzcut. As his nickname suggests, he has a wrinkly face which makes him look much older than his age. This is also commented upon by peers. When he is introduced in the Eli Jang Arc[3] and Jake Kim Arc, he is shown to be wearing Big Deal clothing, which consists of a black blazer, with black trousers, and a white collared shirt. This never gave an indication to what his figure looked like, but later he is revealed to be lean and toned with muscles upon his shoulders, arms, and bares a six pack.[4]",
        "personality": "Old Face, back in the Jake Kim Arc, was shown to be ruthless and two faced. He did have a sense of loyalty to Big Deal, however he also had a sense of disloyalty as well due to the fact that he was never truly loyal to Sinu Han's ideology, but he would always follow Sinu Han's orders and do every one of his tasks that were given. We know his sense of loyalty to Sinu Han was not all false as he respected Sinu Han for his strength and acknowledged him as Big Deal's Big Boss, at the time of the Jake Kim Arc, and stood up to Goo, well was about to, until Sinu Hand had told him not to get involved, which Old Face respected and stood down.\nBased on the type of people that Old Face chooses, and from what we have seen of him as a character and how he rose to the position that he was in Big Deal, it is very clear that he prefers those with power, influence and money, e.g. Samuel Seo, which is just like himself. When Sinu Han had planned his final act and had told Old Face that he was going to give up his ideology and sell Big Deal to workers this hit home to Old Face due to the fact that, 1, Sinu giving up on the ideology meant money finally coming to him, which shows his greed and, 2, being sold to Workers meant that they would gain money and, he himself, would climb his way within Workers and gain power, which also comes with influence as well.\nIn summary Old Face is loyal/unloyal, greedy, and wants to gain power one way or another no matter what he has to do.",

He had a tattoo of a compass under his right eye, he also have tattoos on his abdomen, which consists in a Eastern Dragon accompained by a flower.\nIn his school days, he has short and neat hair, a grayish-blue shirt with a navy blue tie and a brown backpack.",
        "personality": "Olly was a reckless young man with a obsession for dangerous activities. His first appearance was leaping off a smash building and landing on James' car. Despite his craziness, Olly was a very intelligent character and impressed Gun Park with his business skills the first time they met. Jin Jang also decided to work with Olly because he was one of the smartest heads of the crews.[2] This was further supported by the fact that Olly not only saw through Jin Jang's plans and predicted Jang's betrayal but allowed it to happen in order to get Jin Jang to create a distraction, allowing Olly to have alone time with Eli Jang.[3]\nIn the flashback chapters, Olly was introduced as a shy but ambitious person. Upon knowing more about Eli, he praised him and wanted to be like him, going to extreme lengths to get his attention. Many fans compare him to Jiho Park, as both characters sought acknowledgement and validation from their peers, but got the wrong idea of being superior. However, while Jiho was often spiteful of Daniel's friendship and used Daniel and Zack as a means to a higher status, Olly desperately wanted to be a part of Eli's friend group but was repeatedly rejected by Eli because he was not an orphan like the rest of them.\nIn the end, Olly desperately wanted to be accepted by Eli Jang and Hostel, because he considered them family. In Episode 239, he remarked that the \u201cO\u201d in Hostel should represent Olly himself not Warren. It is later revealed, despite everything, he always considered Hostel his family above anything else and worked in his own way to protect them, such as covering Hostel B's payments to Gun and making Gun promise not to hurt Eli.\nHis reckless behavior and choices can be attributed to the fact that he cannot feel pain or emotions. This inability to feel anything also contributed to his obsession with Eli Jang because he believes that Eli was the only one who has made him feel anything previously (this is later revealed to be false, and his guilt over his involvement in Heather's death is really what caused the feelings). He often made exaggerated facial expressions because he was forced to act in order to mimic emotions. Due to this, he had to practice his facial expressions.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Not much is known about Olly's current fighting skills. He used to be weak when he was friends with Eli Jang, however he later underwent training by Gun, as head of the one four crews.\nWhile we don't know the components of his training, we do know that Olly felt no pain and fear towards anyone. This gave him almost supernatural endurance and durability, to the point where he could even tank hits from Warren Chae, Eli Jang, and Gun with no issue. The training had also given him Aikido as one of his martial arts.\nIt was hinted by several characters that Olly may be one of the strongest fighters in the entire series. Jin Jang had noted that Olly Wang rarely fought others on his own, relying on the Uncles instead. He also did not put much work into his crew, instead using Hostel as a means to find Eli. Jin Jang even went so far as to say if Olly had made any serious moves he would have been the one to \"dissolve the four crews into one\".[4]\nAdditionally, Goo Kim and Gun have noted in one of their conversations that it was ridiculous for Olly to seek out Eli if he wanted to feel fear because Olly was stronger than Eli.[5]",

His parents were so overbearing that he felt like he was driven to insanity.[1]\nOlly became obsessed with Eli Jang after witnessing him destroy Backdoor. He did anything to get Eli's attention, stealing from minors and even robbing his own house.

Soon later, he met with Jong Gun, but he was told he was too weak to run a gang.\nGun decided to train Olly, and for the next 3 years he was the new leader of Hostel A.

        "plot": "Olly Wang was first introduced in the Runaway Fam arc as the Big Daddy of Hostel. When Moley brought James Gong to Hostel A's headquarters, Olly decided to test James for the position of Uncle.[2] James beat Chuck Kwak in a fight, so Olly accepted him as an uncle. However, he also stole Olly's cellphones, and he ordered Moley to bring him back.\nOn his journey to find James he ran into Johan Seong, who asked him to help find Gun.[3] Olly began teasing Johan, so the two began fighting until Jin Jang and Jerry Kwon interfered. Olly offered to feed Johan to get him to agree to do business with them. He promised to pay the restaurant bill for the four of them but later decided to leave Johan to pay the bill.\nJin Jang offered to help Olly find Eli Jang if Olly can help him destroy the Burn Knuckles. Olly agreed, and the two formed an alliance.[4]\nIn the meantime, Olly adopted a street kid who looked remarkably similar to Eli Jang. He raised the kid to be a criminal and even named him after Eli Jang. He wanted to raise another version of Eli because he was obsessed with the original Eli.[5]\nIt is revealed that Olly's obsession with Eli Jang is based on the belief that Eli Jang was the only person that allowed him to feel something (this is later revealed as false when Olly comes to the realization that his feeling was due to guilt over Heather's death).\nIt is revealed after his death, that Olly Wang has been covering Hostel B's payments to Gun. He also made Gun promise not to kill Eli (he made this deal knowing he would have to be dead in order for Gun to fulfill it)."

He usually wears a black suit with an orange tie and a white coat with the sleeve that has the Japanese kanji (\u5929\u4e0a\u5929\u4e0b/\u3066\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3066\u3093 \u3052) which means \u201cthroughout heaven and earth). Nomen's jacket is an item he has held from his past as Kagiroi's leader with the rest of his outfit being the standard Workers uniform.\nNomen's outfit whilst operating as the Kagiroi was seen to be all white with loafers, dress pants, and a button-up shirt with a red trim.",
        "personality": "Nomen's core characteristic is his extreme drive. This drive has manifested in both his conquering of the Kanto region of Japan whilst operating as nothing more than a biker gang whilst he was contending with the Yakuza. This drive has also manifested lustfully as his extreme attraction towards Neko or Mitsuki despite her open and extreme adoration towards Sinu Han.\nIn either case, he displays a relaxed aura both towards his gang and whilst flirting and openly soliciting sex with Neko. This results in him being viewed as highly charismatic and intimidating by his gang and other fighters but as nothing more than obnoxious by Neko. The above leads to Nomen openly antagonising all people that make advances or seem to make advances on Neko.\nHowever, this bellies Nomen's own genuine love for Neko. Nomen's lustful actions manifesting partially out of his prior experience of simply and easily obtaining women due to his position and charisma. Nomen is willing to lay down his own life for Neko not simply out of a mere desire for sex.\nNomen is also able to display genuine respect for others, seeing Sinu Han as a rival vying for Neko's attraction alongside himself.",

        "synopsis": "History\nBefore Nomen was a member of Workers as Mitsuki's bodyguard, he was the leader of a biker gang in the Kanto region entitled \"Kagiroi\". Kagiroi's presence was such that they were mythologised as a boogeyman to scare children into being quiet. Kagiroi was strong enough to conquer the Yakuza in the Kanto region even leading to them being known by Gun.\nDespite this, Nomen suffered from one thing: erectile dysfunction. The cause of this was unknown to him, and caused him great distress, emasculating him and depriving him of multiple sexual encounters. However, his continual dismissal of women that wanted him appeared to his gang as him simply having a high standard for women.\nEventually, after Soma Mitsuki took over her father's business, she approached Kagiroi as a business partner and her first bodyguard. Nomen, upon seeing Mitsuki gained an erection for the first time in multiple years. Nomen immediately asked Mitsuki out to view the fireworks. Mitsuki was understandably disgusted by this, her disgust compounded by her pre-existing misandry. However, Mitsuki's disgust only increased Nomen's attraction for her leading him to vow that he would make her his woman.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Nomen is a powerful fighter with seemingly no martial arts background. However, his fighting ability is correlated to his motivation, seemingly compounded greatly if he is in a situation wherein he is threatened.\nNomen's fighting is completely ad-hoc with pure strength as its cornerstone with seemingly no grappling skills.\nRyuhei also has an insane level of weapon proficiency when wielding his Berserker a wooden sword wrapped in chains he was able to use this weapon to trade hits with Gun Park",
        "quotes": "\"I am the mad dog, Kagiroi! I never let go once I bite! I will follow you wherever you go!\" - Ryuhei Kuroda introducing himself to Neko.\n\u201c The more you try to crush him, the stronger he burns. He will never be broken down. He is a flame that will never go out. \u201e -Ryuhei to Sinu.\n\" Wanna go one round with me? \" - Ryuhei to Neko & Gun.",

        "name": "Samuel Seo (\uc11c\uc131\uc740 Seo Seongeun)",
        "appearance": "Samuel Seo is introduced appearing sophisticated and more mature than his actual age. He has fair skin, with a strong V-Shaped jawline and dark, narrow eyes. His figure is extremely muscular, with a more prominent, broader chest and arms than a majority of characters. His black hair is combed back neatly, and he wears slender, rectangular glasses. He is revealed to bear tattoos, consisting of Sak Yant and images of various objects.\n[\n2\n]\nHis standard work attire consists of a clean white suit with a blue tie, occasionally with a brown overcoat draped over his shoulders. He covers his exposed skin, such as his neck and hands, with makeup to cover his tattoos. Outside of work, he is also seen wearing other variations of fashionable matching suits. He isn't as cleaned up, with messy hair that sweeps over his face and rolled sleeves.\nSamuel is notable for his continual creation of bizarre and extreme facial expressions representing his current emotion and his numerous moments of fanservice where he is shown wearing little to no clothing.",
        "personality": "When dealing with the general public, he presents a fa\u00e7ade of being a well-mannered, charming, young man. He is noted by Daniel to be sarcastic,\n[\n3\n]\nalthough there have been no other confirmations of this. Beneath it is a man who is cold-hearted and ruthless. In regards to business matters, Samuel believes that the ends justify the means and will do whatever it takes to get ahead. He does this through various illegal and underhanded methods such as illegal streaming through forced labor contracts and obtaining monetary loans through false promises.\nDespite his arrogant and sadistic attitude, he is shown to have some insecurities that stem from his birth origins. He harbors an inferiority complex that causes him to fly into a rage when he feels he is not being respected or undermined. This is especially the case in situations where Jake is involved.",
        "relationships": "Gun Park\nSamuel greatly respected his strength and wanted Gun Park's recognition, and was willing to do anything for him to recognize him, even to the point that he would beat his own subordinates for his recognition. Soon Samuel did not understand the reason, and held a grudge against Gun Park.\nEli Jang\nEli and Samuel fought together against the first generation king of Suwon and defeated him.\nDaniel Park\nNew Body\nThey meet when Daniel stops him in front of the One MCN building and asks if he's part of Workers.\n[\n1\n]\nSamuel confirms it, they talk, and he leaves, annoyed.\n[\n2\n]\nLater on, after Daniel finds out that Like What and So Funny were being forced to stream due to an inhumane contract, Daniel feels resentfulness and anger towards Samuel for the binding of the contract. Samuel overall seems to be displeased and suspicious towards Daniel.\nAfter Daniel and Warren deal with the 2 main security guards of One MCN, Daniel can be seen fighting with Samuel, even using one of Samuel's brass knuckles in their fight. However, Samuel leaves half-way through, thanking Daniel for unknown reasons after talking with Tom Lee. Samuel seems to be nonchalant, while Daniel seems to be displeased and confused.\nSamuel was beaten along with Jake by Daniel in the third affiliate while Daniel's body was in the unconscious state.\nOld Body\nHe looks at Daniel's application, while Daniel is annoyed that he is acting so calmly, despite admitting that he was part of Workers. After looking at Daniel's application, Samuel says that he really wants Daniel in the company and hires him.\n[\n3\n]\nDaniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel, and gets into his office using the black badge that Gun gave him. He looks around and finds Samuel's brass knuckle, and a board with pictures of the 4 major crews, and weird markings plastered on them. As he hears Samuel get into his secret office, he hides with Alexander Hwang whose in disguise, under a desk. Samuel seems to be suspicious of Daniel disappearing, and Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel's relations towards the 4 crews as well.\nAlexander Hwang\nAlexander and Samuel are implied to have known each other before Samuel even joined Big Deal. Alexander would follow and be loyal to Samuel throughout the years. However, implications of the motivation of staying imply that Alexander wanted to use Samuel.\nIn the early stages of their relationship, Alexander can be seen trying to make himself of a notable identity towards Samuel, yelling out his name at every possible occasion. Later on after Samuel gets rejected by Gun, Alexander can be seen telling Samuel to \"move on\" from Gun throughout the years. In the end, fame and money gets to Alexander, and they develop a relationship where Alexander gets abusive and suspicious of Samuel, even once almost running over Samuel with a car.\nLater in the manhwa when Tom Lee is seen capturing Alexander, (which is later revealed that he took him to make him work for the third affiliate) Hwang calls out to Samuel asking him to save him. However, Samuel ignores Alexander and leaves telling him, \"It's not personal.\" This implies that Samuel does not care about Alexander.\nGoo Kim\nSamuel Seo is one of Goo's four \"secret friends\". Though initially seeking Gun's approval by defeating Olly, Jake and Johan\n[\n4\n]\n, Samuel earned the approval of Goo because of his strength and vicious fighting style.",
        "history": "Samuel was born and raised in a poor environment, as his mother abused him and father was absent in his life. He was also bullied by kids in the neighborhood for not having a father.\nHis last name was chosen randomly, and he did not know his father's last name.\n[\n4\n]\nAs a middle schooler he led the Gangseo Alliance, uniting the local gangs under his leadership. He was powerful enough to be scouted to join Big Deal, one of the Big 4 Crews.\nAt a young age he was always curious about who his father really is, but his mother never let him discover that himself. Because of this, when Samuel found a photo of his mother with the famous gangster Gapryong Kim, and assumed that the man was his father. This boosted Samuel's confidence, as he strived to improve himself in power in order to be recognized as Gapryong's son. However this belief was shattered when his true biological father returned home to his mother. Enraged at the revelation, it is implied that he killed the two of them but there have never been any confirmations of this.\nAt the height of the Gangseo Alliance, Samuel felt offended when he was not directly scouted by\nSinu Han\nto join Big Deal. Thus, he took the Alliance to confront\nJake Kim\n, who was scouted by Sinu himself. After joining Big Deal with Jake, Samuel met people such as a young\nOlly Wang\nand\nJohan Seong\n, and looked down on them. It was only then after Sinu was beaten by\nGun\nand\nGoo Kim\n, Big Deal falling under the mercy of Gun, and the revelation that Jake was Gapryong Kim's son, Samuel ended up straying away from Big Deal and it's original goal and ideals, which culminated in him fighting Jake one last time, and lost. Samuel left Big Deal after that, and quickly formed and dismantled his own crew, Gangseo Union, in Gangnam, to gain Gun's approval. Gun then proceeded to take down Samuel and denied him of his approval, judging that he was a ticking time bomb and wasn't enough of a leader like Jake.\nSamuel then fought between Jake, Olly, and Johan in a fight as the heads of the\nBig 4 Crew\n. He was the first to get taken down during the fight. After reflecting on all the fighters and how they have improved in power and status since they last met, Samuel was demoralized and broken. However, this awakened something in Samuel, as he soon developed a new, more brutal, fighting style. Following this, he immediately beat Jake, Johan, and Olly. While this happened, Goo showed up and was amazed by Samuel's performance that he told Samuel that he approved of him and made him his new secret best friend.\nSamuel later became the executive of the Fourth Affiliate of the Workers, and was complicit in an illegal streaming business until the downfall of One MCN.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Samuel's fighting style reflects its owner's own savagery fueled by inferiority. His style has been described by many as vicious and uncontrollable with liberal usage of weapons such as brass knuckles. Samuel prefers to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength with a tendency towards punches. Samuel's style is such that his defeated opponents are damaged beyond necessity.\nSamuel has been shown to make him able to be on par with Jake Kim and Daniel Park. In the past, he was able to defeat all crew heads after first awakening to his style. Samuel notes that his power peaks when his body feels like it's \"burning up.\" He described this \"burning up\" as \"madness caused by self-hatred.\"\n[\n5\n]\nZack Lee also experienced this phenomenon and became very strong. Samuel's trigger for this state seems to be excitement for a fight.\nIn the 1st Gen King arc it is stated by himself and\nSeokdu Wang\nthat he has reached and surpassed Mastery and Samuel was a big part in the battle against Seokdu as he could tank all the headbutts thrown at him by Seokdu while Warren and Eli was put out of commission with just one. Seokdu Wang even went on to say that Samuel Seo has achieved the Stage of Resilience even saying Samuel Seo has The Ultimate Resilience.\nIn Chapter 466, Samuel was drugged by Jinyoung Park to feel an overwhelming sense of inferiority, causing him to go insane, aiming to kill whoever came in the room he was hidden in. It was revealed that the drugs had caused Samuel to bring up his past, where he deep down believed that Gapryong Kim had been his father, but been disappointed in the end. Afterwards, he began to bring up the incident where he had defeated his own union (Gangseo Union) just to gain Gun's approval, but was rejected. The throwback of these incidents had made Samuel insanely strong, fueling his inferiority complex to the point where even a full force hit from Jake Kim left him unfazed.\nWhat makes his strength even more crazy is that Samuel Seo never had a teacher and learnt a distinct fighting style, his fighting style is barbaric and crude, flaunting off his sadistic nature.",

        "name": "Shingen Yamazaki",
        "appearance": "Shingen was a tall and muscular middle-aged man with long black hair and white eyes with black clera. He had around his body from neck to toe tattoos who range from tiger-shaped patterns, one on his back and two on his broad shoulders and a bunch of cloud tattoos over his body. He wears nothing but a simple white tonga, but he casually wears a black hanfu tied by a dark gray rope under a dark gray kimono.",
        "personality": "Shingen's behavior by the time he had fathered Gun and his brothers is like that of a introvert, he is also cold to most of everyone he meets and sees, and it seems he doesn't even know the children that he has from all of his concubines, Gun is one of the many children of his.\nAs noted by his father and concubine, Shingen had once been an exceptionally vicious and blood thirsty man and was feared as a literal demon by both his syndicate and enemies. However, as implied, his defeat by\nGapryong Kim\nand his gang had caused a severe psychological blow to him. After his defeat, Shingen had become extremely lethargic and practically unresponsive to almost everyone and everything. So much so that he barely payed attention to \u201cconcubines\u201d, of which he barely payed conscious attention to and he himself had no idea that he even had children with them. This is shown where he hardly ever payed attention or noticed Gun\u2019s mother despite spending so much time together with her and despite her talking so much about their son and his accomplishments, Shingen had likely completely ignored her. Having no idea who Gun was when he came face to face with him and asked him who he was.\nDespite his generally lethergic and apathetic behavior, Shingen can come out of it should he find sufficient reason to. As shown when he had taken action to defend himself when the three vassal family heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate had tried to kill him. As shown, Shingen retains deep respect for his \u201copponent\u201d who is in Korea and he refused to die or be defeated by anyone elses hand.\nDuring his last fight against his twin brother, Shintaro, Shingen fully exhibited his emotions. As shown where he showcased the deep love, care and trust he had for his twin brother refusing to believe that he would betray him. Shingen himself admitted that if Shintaro has simply asked him for the position of the head of the Yamazaki, Shingen would give it to him no questions asked, with him expressing that he always believed that Shintaro was much more suited for the position.  Later, he would finally acknowledged Somi when she betrayed him and stabbed him, expressing interest in her when she began revealing her true emotions. When two of his sons came to his side to help him fend off Shintaro\u2019s forces, Shingen expressed surprise and developed a level of attachment to them immediatly, with him later expressing anger when Shintaro killed them. In the end, Shingen eventually acknowledged Gun and died protecting him.\nDuring his youth, Shingen also exhibited an outgoing personality and seemed generally positive as a person. It is likely that his circumstances were similar to Gun and the way he seemed \"vicious\" and \"bloodthirsty\" to others was most likely instilled into him by his father.",
        "relationships": "Gun Park\nShingen is seen to be cold to everyone, it is shown he doesn't really know who Gun is as the first interaction of him and Gun is strained and it seems that he could probably not know his other kids.\nDuring Shintaro's rebellion, Shingen started expressing interest in Gun, to the extent of even protecting him and losing an arm in the process. Before his death, Shingen apologises to Gun and saves Gun's life in one final act of sincerity in exchange for losing his life.\nShintaro Yamazaki\nShingen had a sibling and brotherly relationship with Shintaro, which was shown positively during their youth. Despite the internal turmoils and tragedy that would come in their adulthood, Shingen still loved his brother and believed that he wouldn't go as far as to deliberately start a rebellion on his own and that there was a misunderstanding, also admitting in tandem that he would've given him the position if he just asked. Shingen spent his last moments apologizing to Shintaro and understood why his anger came to be.\nSomi Park\nShingen initially showed signs of coldness towards Somi due to his lethargic state, but when the rebellion instigated by Shintaro came to be, Shingen admitted he was expressing interest in the latter and even spared her life despite being one of the traitors going against him.",
        "synopsis": "TBA",
        "fighting_prowess": "Shingen during the era of Gapryong's Fist.\nHe was one of the two people who were a threat to Gapryong Kim at the time. Due in part to his colossal size and muscularity, he fights ferociously and brutally, maiming many of the gang members who ambushed him effortlessly. He also possesses the \"Black Bone\" trait which supposedly makes him immune or somewhat invulnerable to blades and swords. Like all the generational heads of Yamazaki clan he also inherited Ultra Instinct State with a greater control over it, due to his ogre like build he has immense strength to fight all the vassals of Yamazaki clan who rebelled against him.\nEven in his lethargic state, Shingen was still powerful enough to gradually overwhelm Shintaro despite likely not having fought since his defeat at the hands of Gapryoung Kim. It was as such that Shintaro severely wounding him with the Yodo Muramasa and taking one of his arms away was due to Shingen deliberately letting him so, in an act to protect Gun, rather than Shingen not being able to intercept his attacks.\nCongenital Ultra Instinct\n\"Do you know why he fights alone when he wants to go all out? That's because while others adjust their Ultra Instincts to become stronger, Shingen adjusts his Ultra Instinct to suppress his strength, to avoid tearing his subordinates into pieces. The Trait of the Yamazaki is indiscriminate violence. The Child of the Reverse Eyes is the one born with that nature. The moment the child with the Reverse Eyes stops controlling his Ultra Instinct,\nthe Oni comes out.\"\n-\nGapryong Kim\n, CHAPTER 525\nBeing born with the Reverse Eyes congenitally, Shingen is also capable of entering a true-unconscious state where he relinquishes his control over his Ultra Instinct and starts fighting purely on his own instincts for battle. In this state, Shingen is incapable of distinguishing allies from foes, and is unconscious about his own strength.\nIn this state, not only was he capable of ripping bodies apart near effortlessly even with only one arm and fatal injuries all over his body, but was also vastly more powerful than Shintaro and even rendered the advantage of the Yodo Muramasa completely null.",
        "quotes": "\"Yamazaki Shintaro.\nI would've given you the position of the family head anytime if you just asked. But you dare break the moral laws of family traditions?\nAre you that desperate for this position?\n\" - Chapter 524\n\"Kid, Tell me. If there's something you want, I'll give it to you.\" - Chapter 525, to\nGun Park\n\"This is my first, and last bit of sincerity to you.

Though Vin would ultimately relent so as to not kill him, Shinmyung tried to retaliate by lifting a huge rock above Vin's head to bludgeon him to death. In the process, however, he stepped on the headband of Vin's mother, causing him to slip when Vin picked it up.

        "name": "Shintaro Yamazaki",
        "appearance": "Shintaro  Yamazaki is seen as a tall lean like man but is muscular, he has fairish skin like Shingen, he has a jet black colored slick back hair style similar to Gun's, he has broad shoulders, he is very handsome, has features like Shingen. He has Tiger tattoos too, except it doesn't cover his chest and torso part but at his sides and arms and down to the legs.\nHe is usually seen using a white Kimono and a white Haori with a black crest of the Yamazaki symbol, he also uses light grey Hakama pants, white tabi socks, and white geta clogs and he is usually see with a black fan that he is either holding or tucking it in his Hakama pant's waist area.",
        "personality": "Shintaro himself is noted to be exceptionally intelligent and capable, to the point that many in the Yamazaki Syndicate believe that he should be its leader.  However, Shintaro is a staunch believer in the Yamazaki Syndicate\u2019s rules and traditions to a fanatical degree. As shown, Shintaro is extremely devoted to his twin brother Shingen. Having viciously refused the offer of the three Branch Family Heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate to become the new head of the clan due to his brother\u2019s lethargy and proceeded to brutally execute them for betraying the syndicates traditions.  While he acknowledges that his brother\u2019s lethargy is determental to the orginization as a whole and him taking over the syndicate would beneifit and restore the syndicate to its former glory, Shintaro never the less continues to insist to follow the syndicate\u2019s rules despite the degredation and weakening of the group as a whole.\nA serious man who places the Yamazaki Clan's rules above all else, even commanding a young Gun Park to kill his son for dissuading him from becoming the next Clan Head. As noted by the Branch Family Leader\u2019s who he executed, him ordering the death of his own child had a deeper psychological effect on Shintaro than he initially believes and he may feel subconscious remorse at having done so and this has lead him to become even more fanatical in following the Syndicate\u2019s traditions and rules. Later on knowing the truth about his birth, he gets completely broken down mentally and goes on to kill Shingen to become the family head\nAs shown, after the truth of his birth was revealed, Shintaro immediatly felt immense guilt, despair and sadness at the death of his only son Haruto. Shintaro truly treasured and loved Haruto and fully acknolwedged his competence and skill as a leader and knew that if the Gun had become the next head of the Yamazaki, Haruto\u2019s supporters would likely revolt. Hence, the need for Haruto to die to preserved the syndicate and the rules and traditions Shintaro held so high. with Shintaro being able to initially maintain his sanity due to believing it was for the greater good of the syndicate. But when the truth was revealed to him on how he was the true firstborn and the true heir of the syndicate, Shintaro immediatly realized that Haruto\u2019s death was in vain and that as his own first born son, Haruto was always meant to be the heir.\nThis guilt of throwing away his son\u2019s life for nothing completely distabalized Shintaro\u2019s psyche. With him choosing to become the head of the Yamazaki clan due to him clinging to the rules and traditions he held and put the utmost importance in since the day he was born in order to avoid the despair of how pointlessly he had thrown away the life of his only son. With Shintaro even admitting that he never wanted to be the head in the first place and that he had only done so due to the \u201crules\u201d demanding that he take the position. Upon successfully taking the position however, Shintaro admitted that this only brought him more despair and made him feel emptier as time went on. As shown from Gun\u2019s return to the syndicate years later, Shintaro had already become suicidal and had long since decided that he wanted to die while still within the \u201crules\u201d he followed and valued so much; by having Gun kill him and take his place as the new Yamazaki Head. In the end of his life, Shintaro was relieved to have finally escaped the rules of the Yamazaki he had lived under for so long and died content leaving everything to Gun.",
        "relationships": "Haruto Yamazaki\nIt is seen that Shintaro doesn't have that much mercy on Haruto, as he was the one that made Haruto kill himself, as it was because he managed to make Gun see the bright side of things and almost turn down the role of the Yamazaki heir. When he realises that Haruto's suicide was a vain cause on learning the secret of his birth he completely breaks down.\nShingen Yamazaki\nIt is shown that Shintaro is dedicated to Shingen and even turned down the role of being the Yamazaki leader, as he said he will never break that Yamazaki protocol of the fact the oldest child gets to be the heir but on realising the sceret of his birth he gets a psycophathic trigger to kill his brother to follow the rule of the eldest child becomes the clan head. He also stated that he would correct the wrongdoings of the former oyabun and will become the clan leader himself.",
        "synopsis": "During birth both Shintaro and Shingen where born as twins but due to the Midwife's scheme Shingen became the eldest son and by succesion order he became the President of Yamazaki Syndicate,which was by birth right the position of Shintaro, even as the vice president of the syndicate he worked hard for the syndicate and helped it to flourish,their birth secret was known by former Yamazaki president and their father,Yamazaki Shinji, but he made no correction to this mistake as everyone thought Shintaro had no\nreverse eyes\nwhich\nwas the distingushing  feature of the family head( not succesion by birth).\nAfter the rebellion of the vassal families of the syndicate, When Shintaro came to know the truth form the midwife and the former oyabun he conspired against Shingen with Park Somi and even stabbed Shingen by manipulating Park Somi,killed the former oyabun killed the nameless descendants of Shingen who were protecting him and revealed that he also had Ultra Instinct.",
        "fighting_prowess": "See article:\nUltra Instinct\nLike all Yamazaki Family Members he also has black bone and Ultra Instinct that he could control on will ,unlike Shingen and Gun who where always in\nReverse Eyes\nmode further his speed ,fighting prowess is somewhat equivalent to that of Shingen and he also has impenetrable Black Bone. He also had same raw strength as Shingen and easily twisted the necks of Shingen's nameless children and crushed their skulls easily. Though, like his younger sibling, he inherited UI since birth. He is also proficient with Akido which helped him to fight on par with Shingen, he is also proficient with blades and katanas.\nYears after Shingen's death and his rise to leadership of the Yamazaki Syndicate, Shintaro became immensely powerful, where even though he fought in a carefree and depressed manner, he was able to overpower Gun Park, who had been training in Korea for years. Therefore, it is impossible to determine his true strength, since, even while fighting Gun in his cogenital \"Oni\" Ultra Instinct state, he was merely reflecting on his entire life and decisions with remorse. Even more so, he forced his own death by forcing Gun's fist to pierce his stomach.",

She harbored feelings for him but, like the others, was forced to sever her left pinky as a sign of her commitment. Her loyalty to Shingen was unwavering, and she raised Gun with the sole purpose of making him worthy of his lineage. While it is unclear how deep her personal connection with Shingen was, she dedicated her life to ensuring his legacy through Gun.",

It was later clarified that the \u201cPark Family\u201d was vassal yakuza family sworn to the Yamazaki. However, due to their Korean Blood, their standing amongst the rest of the syndicate was not high, nor were they respected much by the other vassal families. It was only with Somi\u2019s actions in becoming Shingen\u2019s concubine and bearing Gun and later marrying Shintaro and becoming the official legal wife of the Yamazaki, was her family properly acknowledged and treated rightfully.\nUnlike typical mothers, she raised Gun Park with extreme discipline, refusing to let him play or act like a normal child.
