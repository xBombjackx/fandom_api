The
0th Generation
, also refered to as
Gapryong's Fist
or
The Pre-generation
, was an influential group of fighters dismantled decades ago at the time of the writing. Led by Gapryong Kim, considered the legend of his generation, the
0th Generation
is well-known and reputed to have been the era of some of the strongest characters of the series and its universe. Eugene even said its the generation of Gods and Masters.
History
Gapryong Kim
was the most influential member of the
Pre-generation
, and he rallied people around him to create the
Gapryong's Fist
. During this time gangs were called fists, and gang leaders were called bosses.
It is known that Gapryong Fist were at all-out war with the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
Gapryong and his organisation are told to have rallied the whole criminal underworld during this time, amassing a net worth as high as Seoul's budget. (according to Google, 41.85 trillion Won, or $35.12 billion USD)
Gapryong's organization led the pre-generation for a while until he decided to enter politics, despite being unsuccessful. His followers began fighting each other out of greed, which led to the beginnings of the
1st generation
.

Synopsis
The
pre-generation
first appeared in chapter 359 when DG explains to Daniel about the history of the fists. In this generation, there were no leaders but bosses, and the teams were called fists. The
pre-generation
was characterized as a generation of people united around Gapryong Kim.

Trivia
During the Pre-Generation, crews were called "Fists" and crew heads were called "Bosses"
[

About the
"Gapryong Kim's fist gang"
it is said in chapter 411 that "Each member had a different goal, but they united under the banner of the fist gang to fight against a
"great power".
It is not known what things were like before the
pre-generation
, it is most likely that the
"Great Power"
had a lot of presence in those times. Most likely, there was no one who could stand up to him. Perhaps the gangs of those times were not called "Fists" and their leaders would not be called "Bosses" (although the latter can be questioned for obvious reasons).
It was recently revealed in chapter 502 that the time of Generation 0 was a battle of countries, Korea against Japan, the former being known as Japan's
"great power"
and Korea's greatest enemy, the leader of the Yamazaki Clan, as well as the father of Gun Park,
Shingen Yamazaki
.
[

]
Gapryong's line about Gun Park's father having "chosen his death" implies something akin to that of a tragedy for Shingen may have happened during their great fight. This is also faintly supported by Shingen's line about "I'm not going to miss the next time" and "It's all in the past now".

Episode 359

Gun Park's Father
In Generation 0, it is known from
Jichang
that there was a feud between
Jinyoung Park
and
Elite/Charles Choi
. The reason why they hated each other is unknown at the moment.
The identity of the
Generation 0
Bosses is unknown, we only know one Boss and that is
Gapryong Kim
, it is known that he was the strongest of them as he was the Legend of his Generation.
Theories:
As to whether or not there was a Boss in Seoul, there is no doubt that in the
First Generation
there was no Boss in Seoul. The reason is simple and it is because the place was dominated by
Jichang
(the former King of Seoul) and later by the eldest son of Gapryong Kim (the current King of Seoul). It is unlikely that Bosses and Kings shared their territories.
James Lee
states that the
pre-generation
was a generation of people united around Gapryong Kim. He also confirms to us that undoubtedly, all the "Fists" and "Bosses" were comrades of
Gapryong Kim
. All of them must have had the same goal of facing a
"very great power".
Perhaps, the pre-generation began with various gangs and leaders.  But Gapryong's gang would be known as "Fist" and he would be the Boss.  He would then begin to confront and defeat the disunited gangs, it could be said that he would unify the Korean gangs.  Along the way, he would earn several comrades by defeating rival gangs.  Possibly Jinyoung Park, Tom Lee and Elite used to be leaders of those gangs OR they were already Fists of Gapryong Kim from the start.  In this way, Gapryong Kim would unite most of the Korean gangs that were disunited.
There are reasons why a Boss will stop dominating a place. First, this Bosses retired like
Gapryong Kim
would to do something else, which would be normal considering how much time has passed. Second, the Bosses that participated in the
First Generation
stopped dominating their corresponding zone because they would be defeated and replaced by some King. This last option should be the least likely, but it would not be impossible considering factors such as age. In addition to that it is not known what level those Bosses are at and there is a possibility that they are at the level of the Kings or a little higher, both in the pre-generation and in the first generation (where they would be weaker due to age).
"Very Great Power" Theories
1- That
"very great power"
could be the Yakuza itself, the reasons to believe that it was the yakuza is because in real life there was a "gangster" named Kim Du-Han, he grew up as a beggar due to the death of his parents and he became involved with a local gang called the Jumok ("fist"). Kim Du-Han faced the yakuza, becoming a symbol of the resistance of the Koreans against the Japanese. Kim Du-Han was a major figure in the movement against colonial rule and later became a politician. If it came to be true, that would mean that the reason Gun sided with Charles Choi would be to kill Gapryong Kim (who would be the Kim Du-Han of this universe) for having been an enemy of the Yakuza in his time.
The error of this last theory would be to see how in lookism Koreans hate Gapryong Kim for his past as a gang member, being the reason why he failed to be a politician unlike Kim Du-Han.

The
1st Generation
is a group of fighters that follow the
0th generation
. It is also known as the Generation of Circles or the Generation of War. It was the only generation in which fists and circles coexisted. This generation ended when James Lee beat the circles. Sometime later, James Lee would appear as one of Charles Choi's Ten Geniuses and would start the
2nd generation
crews with the help of Charles along with the other nine geniuses.
History
The
1st Generation
was first revealed by DG episode 359 when DG explained to Daniel the
History of Fists
.
[
1
]
During this generation, Gapryong's followers began to fight each other for greed and power, and that struggle for power ended up with them recruiting high school students who were followers of the Pre-Generation. "The Fist" would rule over these groups of students known as "circles" and within those students, individuals would rise above them and become leaders known as "Kings". They tended to occupy larger areas such as a city and provinces in the countryside in order to run illegal businesses to make money.
There is known to be a "ranking" of Kings, where those of a higher ranking are from larger, more significant regions in Korea.
The generation was full of violence and had no romance. "Kings" and "Circles" would always be in a constant struggle fighting over territory until the strongest member of this generation,
James Lee
would appear. He ended the circles by defeating the kings, mutilating several of the kings in the process. It's unknown how many Kings he did this to, as kings like Jichang did not lose a body part, there are only two confirmed victims. He took
Taesoo Ma
's right eye and contributed to the loss of
Gongseob Ji
's right leg.
[

]
The fate of the fists that participated in the first generation is unknown but after this most people of the 1st Generation were scarred by him. Most of them would stay put in their own territory passing on the story of the Legend that ended the 1st Generation.
Most Kings would do the same, continuing their businesses in their own territories, other kings like, Gongseob Ji, would renounce their position and distance themselves from his past. After the flames of war died out, James Lee would become one of the ten genius and helped
Charles Choi
build a new era of the crews that would later become the
2nd Generation
. He would also be manipulated by Charles Choi which ended in him killing
Gapryong Kim
before disappearing without a trace.
[
1
]
Most of the 1st Generation would take in pupils from the 2nd Generation in order to pass on their training methods, they are still searching for James Lee to pay him back for what he did.
[
1
]
Synthesis
Generation 0.5:
This "generation" would exist after
pre-generation/generation 0
ended and
Gapryong Kim
handed over most of the organization to his followers (apparently they were pre-generation as well). And as
James Lee
says, those followers were a problem. Since these would start wars out of greed and thus the first generation would emerge. It is unknown what this "generation" would be like, but it is possible that the teams continued to be called Fists and their leaders would be Bosses.
Generation 1:
In this generation, Gapryong Kim's followers would recruit students for their power struggles. In this way, the pregeneration and those students would fight those wars together. The students associated with the pregeneration were called Circles, the leaders of these Circles were known as Kings. Possibly the leaders of the Fists (pre-generation/followers of Gapryong Kim) who participated in the First Generation were still called Chiefs.  Some time later, several Kings would go to Cheonliang to help Seongji Yuk. A year later, James Lee would wipe out the first generation by defeating the kings, as well as taking a part of their body (either an eye or a leg). Meanwhile, Charles Choi would already have all 10 of his geniuses at his disposal.
Shortly after, the second generation would begin with the meeting of Charles and some of his geniuses.
Conclusion:
It is not known what the fate of the fists was with the appearance of James Lee, because it is only mentioned how he defeated the circles to eliminate the links between the pre-generation and the first generation. You can only make theories and assumptions about what was the fate of the fists that participated in this generation
End of First Generation
Theories
1- The simplest answer (the most boring and disappointing) is that the Fists chickened out when they saw how the Circles were defeated and crushed by James Lee.
2- James Lee also took care of the Fists, but it was simply not mentioned explicitly because it perhaps seemed unnecessary to say it at the time. I consider it one of the most probable theories or the most probable.
3- The current king of Seoul would defeat the Fists, in my opinion it is less likely than the two previous theories.  I think it might be possible because he is very strong.
4- Daniel's second corps defeated the Fists. I consider it even less likely than the above theory (and by far) due to the fact that in those days he should only be a tween or teenager, plus no one recognized him.
Hypothesis
1- One of the three unrevealed geniuses of Charles Choi was the one who defeated the Fists and their Bosses (to put Charles Choi's plan into action and then start the next generation).
2- One of the followers of Gapryong Kim defeated the Fists and their Chiefs, the reason would be the indignation or regret for what the other followers of Gapryong Kim caused.
3- The person who would defeat the Fists would be a member of the "great power". I think at some point they will show us what they are or were capable of doing.
4- A character that we do not know at all was the one who crushed the Fists. I consider it less likely than the previous hypotheses, but who knows.

About the Provinces/Cities
Ansan
Ansan is an industrial city in Korea, located close to Seoul and south of Incheon, forming part of Gyeonggi Province. Now, within the series, Ansan has as King
Taesoo Ma
, whose unique fighting style is the use of only one fist (a style that was named Hard Fist).
During the First Generation, it is unknown what the "Ansan Circle" was like, or how Taesoo Ma ran it (or if he even ran it).
Currently
, Ansan's most notable crew is
Ansan Public
, which owns a karaoke bar.
After certain events, Ansan Public was subjugated by the
Workers' 5th Affiliate
, while still managed by
Eli Jang
. After the departure of
Eli Jang
and
Warren Chae
from Workers, Ansan's current status remains unknown.
Busan
Busan was under the rule by Dalyoung Oh, the head of Busan Gang and a former disciple of Gapryong Kim. He ruled with an iron fist, making the city bend towards his will, using Gapryong's name to get whatever he wanted.
This was until Lang Jin returned and rebelled against him, killing Dalyoung after he witnessed how Dalyoung mistreated his subordinates. This would lead to Lang Jin usurping the throne. Busan would then be reorganised under the Lang Jin Gang while their boss was serving time in prison.
Cheonliang
Seongji Yuk
did not participate in any financial activities in the past. He did not have a legitimate crew to rule over the region as majority of the region had been brainwashed. He lived on a mountain with the Cheonliang Fam to evade the
Shaman's
false god brainwashing.
Soon after the death of Seongji Yuk and kidnapping of
Cheon Taejin
, Cheonliang would be developed into a luxury resort with beaches, under the
HNH conglomerate.
Chungcheong
TBA
Daegu
TBA
Incheon
Known as the "land of war" or "land of internal conflict", Incheon is divided and under rule by two kings, since the 0th Generation, with
Jaegyeon Na
and
Yujae Seon
against each other. From flashbacks during the Busan arc and with context between James Lee's and Jaegyeon's conversation, James has some leverage over Jaegyeon. Which allows James some measure of control over the actions of Jaegyeon, as seen in the Busan arc where he betrayed Allied.
Pyeongtaek
TBA
Seoul
Seoul was originally run by
Jichang Kwak
, but later ceded to Kitae Kim after Jichang was taken down. It is known that Kitae immediately left for Mexico after claiming the seat of King of Seoul, leaving Seoul to be divided into the 4 Major Crews later in the Second Generation.
Seongnam
TBA
Suwon
Suwon engaged in a thug for hire business called the Suwon Staffing Agency run by Seokdu Wang. This business would be then taken over by the Workers' 5th Affiliate after its head got beaten by Eli Jang.
Similarities in Fighting Style
While all of the 1st generations fight in distinct styles, all of them run with a consistent theme of training one part of their body to reach its full potential. James Lee trained his legs to become so fast that no one could ever see his attacks, Jichang Kwak trained his hands and upper forearms to make his chops as sharp as blades, Taesoo Ma trained his left fist to become strong enough to crank even boulders, Gongseob Ji trained his torso to make his body be as durable as steel and Seokdu Wang trained his forehead to be able to kill people with just one headbutt.
Nameless Kings
Original King of Chungcheong:
We know of his existence thanks to a mention by
James Lee
, apparently he was defeated and usurped by
Jichang
, after this it is not known what happened to this King. The curious thing about him is that he dominated an entire province, in which there are several cities that could easily have other Kings, even with that problem he was able to dominate the entire place. It is unknown if in Lookism, Chungcheong is just one province OR if it is also divided in two like in real life. If he were the latter, it would mean that he dominated North and South Chungcheong, thus he would be known as the King of Chungcheong. From his level we only know that he is weaker than
Jichang
, so there is no way to calculate his strength, but he can/could/would be immensely powerful even to be stronger than Suwon, Seongnam and Pyeongtaek kings as he ruled over an area bigger than Seokdu, Pyeongtaek king and Seongnam king areas combined (now not assuming he is stronger than those three combined just that he ruled over an area larger), and it is also in the countryside and we know with Vin Jin that the only fun things to do in the country side is to fight.

Trivia
It is unknown who were the members of the

Every time James Lee fights a King, the background goes up in flames. The reasoning behind this is most likely the Kings' way of asking for help.

The
Second Generation
is the current era of fighters and where most of the main characters come from. Almost all of the Second Generation are high schoolers, some are successors of
1st Generation Kings
continuing their legacy. The majority of the Second Generation remains disunited and makes their money mostly through petty crimes committed by students, however, above all the disorganization and petty thief stood four gangs.
Unlike "Fists" and "Circles"  of the past, they were called "Crews," The
Four Major Crews
were founded by
Charles Choi
and the
Ten Geniuses
to help Charles Choi kickstart his
business
. Four pre-established gangs would be chosen and tasked to make at least a hundred million won a month legally and 3 out of the 4 leaders became Gun's successors.
Gun
has offered any of his successors who can unite the
four crews
under their leadership immense money and status, but none have been able to do so yet. The second generation tends to fight less than previous generations.
History
The End of the First Generation
After
James Lee
took down the First Generation by himself, Charles Choi had ambitions to skyrocket his business and accomplish his "big plan". This was when he founded the Ten Geniuses, nurturing each of these individuals to excel in their specialized fields, and to assist him in his dealings as well.
Two main individuals would mainly act in this, namely
Gun Park
and
Goo Kim
, establishing a large network of debt collecting businesses throughout Korea, They threatened the local crews that they would be destroyed completely if they did not pay up their dues.
The Founding of the Four Major Crews
Charles Choi then ordered Gun and Goo to start collecting dues from 4 crews in Seoul consisting of minors. Before this, they went to scout Gangbuk's legendary shoe thief
Johan Seong
and later successfully convince him to be the leader of the
God Dog
crew, in hopes that he would able to earn enough money to pay for his mother's eye surgery.
At the same time,
Eugene
began to formulate the business plan for the
Workers
, another crew included watching over the Gangnam district.
After Gangbuk, they went to Gangseo to find the reputable
Big Deal
led by
Sinu Han
. Sinu had put up strong resistance but was ultimately unable to save Big Deal from becoming one of the Four Major Crews. In order to prevent Big Deal from being annhilated, Sinu sold himself to the newly founded Workers for 2.2 Billion Won, leaving
Jake Kim
in charge.
After acquiring three crews, Gun went to Gangdong to recruit the last crew. He originally planned to recruit
Back Door
but was later impressed by
Eli Jang
's prowess and
Olly Wang
's business plans, putting
Hostel
as the fourth and last crew. After a series of unforseeable incidents and Eli Jang's disappearance, Hostel split into two,
Hostel A
being the one that pays the debts.
The Start of the Four Major Crews
Finally, Seoul was divided into
North: God Dog
,
South: Workers
,
East: Hostel
, and
West: Big Deal
. After this Charles would be able to start his business and rise the ranks in the world, he spent less and less attention to the Four Major Crews and Gun would take control. He would take the 3 out of the 4 crew heads and train them to become his successors. He wanted one of them to rise and give him an entertaining challenge and to motivate them, he would offer an immense amount of money and power if any of his candidates were able to unite the Four Major Crews under his leadership. While the Crews would usually kept to themselves, due to this newfound promise and the pressure of making the monthly quota, tensions would rise in Seoul as each crew leader vied for Gun's succession, and like the Generations before them, they soon began fighting for territory and this tension would last for 2 years.
Daniel Park enters the picture
In order to obtain the secret as to why Daniel Park has two bodies, DG requests Daniel to unite the Four Major Crews. As he does so, he uncovers the evil deeds each crew has been doing for money: Hostel exploiting the Runaway Fam, Big Deal's Numbers Racket and God Dog's fake bank account scams.
Fate of the Crews
God Dog had self-destructed and was disqualified by Gun after J-High and the Burn Knuckles had intervened and put a stop to their illegal businesses, leaving Johan Seong as its lone member.
After God Dog,
Daniel Park
targetted Hostel next. He managed to rise through the ranks and infiltrate Olly Wang's Hostel A and reunite Hostel B. Eli had conflict with Olly which ultimately led to Hostel B's destruction and Hostel A's disqualification.
After Hostel, Daniel Park went to find clues regarding James Lee, which led him to Moon High School, where he encounters Gun Park. After a long time fighting, Gun is impressed with Daniel's fighting and gives him the Black Badge and a ONE MCN card, instructing him to destroy the Workers on his behalf.
Later, Jake Kim is released from prison and recovers Sinu Han from the Workers, and as a result wages war on them. The Workers make the first move and attack Big Deal street. They fail to burn down Big Deal street after facing strong resistance from both Big Deal and J-High, but the police, siding with the Workers, interfere and Big Deal is now wanted for causing "a gang fight between teenagers and illegal immigrants".
The Workers
have
Hostel
on their side,
God Dog
is gone, and
Big Deal
is on the brink of extinction. The Workers have managed to unify the Four Major Crews.
In response,
Daniel
creates his Crew
"Allied"
whose purpose is to stop the
Workers
, although Daniel is also interested in stopping
Charles Choi
.
Four Major Crews
See main article:
Four Major Crews
The Four Major Crews in the Seoul area were divided by territory, with J-High located in central Seoul, right in the middle of the four crews. After the battle between Big Deal and the Workers, the four crews were unified under the Workers.
The Four Major Crews:
Big Dea
l
- Crew of Gangseo (West)
God Dog
- Crew of Gangbuk (North)
Workers
- Crew of Gangnam (South)
Hostel
- Crew of Gangdong (East)
Synthesis
Generation 1.5/"generation" of geniuses
This "generation" would take place after James Lee finished the First Generation. Charles Choi would manage to train the 10 geniuses, it is not known if before or after the death of Gapryong Kim. The legend of Generation 0 would suddenly die and no one knows how or why. From the statements of some characters, it is known that the King of Seoul and James Lee were the ones who killed Gapryong Kim. It is unknown which of these statements is true or if they are both correct (that is, that the two killed Gapryong Kim). Shortly after, Charles with some of his geniuses would begin the second generation.
Sinu Han (
The Boy of Promise
)
Goo Kim (
The Weapon Genius
)
Gun Park (
Shiro Oni
)
Generation 2/generation of the 4 major crews
These
crews
which were created by
Charles Choi
are meant to make money for Charles Choi to start his own business with some criminal activities. These crews are
Workers
,
Big Deal
,
Hostal
and
God Dog
. They can only get money legally, but they can also get money illegally (not to be caught though, obviously).
Charles
still had 10 of his geniuses to help him with his business in different aspects and areas, that is, each genius has a responsibility to help him in a certain area in which his expertise lies. Of the
ten geniuses
, we know 7 of them:
Crystal Choi
,
Gun Park
,
Goo Kim
,
Diego Kang(DG)
,
Kouji
,
Tom Lee
and
Jinyoung Park
(with the latter it is a surprise that he will help
Charles
).
Conclusion:
The Workers
were able to unite the
four crews
, they have
Hostel
on their side,
God Dog
is no more, they dominated the territory (Gangseo) of
Big Deal
.
Daniel
created his own
crew
to stop them, though upon learning of
Charles Choi's
misdeeds, he too is interested in stopping the latter.

Mysteries
One of the mysteries of this generation is the second body of Daniel. Apparently a perfected version of the protagonist (Daniel), his own fighting style was unknown until he entered the UI state. In this state, he showed that he knows all kinds of martial arts. For now, there is no clue to his identity. The alarming thing about the second body would be his resemblance to Daniel Park and Jinyoung Park.
Another mystery is related to the second body of Daniel and James Lee. And this mystery would be why Daniel (big) has the identity of James Lee. If Charles Choi could create a false identity for James Lee (the false identity is Diego Kang) why didn't he do the same with Daniel (big)? He decided to give him an existing identity, instead of giving him a fake one like he did with James Lee.
The true identity of Big Daniel is unknown, for a moment it was believed to be James Lee but it was confirmed that it was someone else. Therefore there is no clue who he could be, much less because he looks like "little" Daniel and Jinyoung Park.
Somehow, Jinyoung Park was one of Charles Choi's 10 geniuses. This would clearly mean that he helped him in some way, the question is why would he do that? It was recently mentioned that there was a feud between Jinyoung Park and Elite/Charles, so it is unlikely that Jinyoung decided to help him. Possibly Jinyoung was threatened or his family was threatened.
Apparently, Jinyoung has a memory that makes him want to die. One would think it was because of Gapryong's death, but in his fight against Tom Lee it was shown that Jinyoung already knew about Gapryong's death and believed that Tom Lee was his killer (for unknown reasons). But in the middle of the fight he remembered something that made him completely crazy.
The last detail related to Jinyoung Park would be the comment he made when he discovered Daniel's secret. Jinyoung wondered if the same thing happened to Daniel. That dialogue can have two interpretations. First, the other person who also has a second body like Daniel could be Jinyoung Park (his second body of his or his original body would be a mystery). Second, Jinyoung knows another person who has two bodies (he possibly knows about Crystal's case because he is one of the ten geniuses or maybe he knows another character who had two bodies).
James Lee's intentions to find Jinyoung Park are uncertain. In case he's an infiltrator working for Charles Choi in secret, he'll obviously kill Jinyoung or something. And in case he really did betray Charles Choi, there's no telling why James Lee is so sure that Jinyoung Park knows secrets that could hurt Charles. Daniel did well to continue to mistrust James Lee, he has no good reason to trust him.
About the above unknown, we can also wonder about the comment Charles Choi makes in chapter 177. After Daniel asked him about the identity and origin of the perfect body, Charles says that he will tell him when he surpasses DG. Then Charles mentions that DG made him a lot of money but he became too important/big. Charles Choi probably already knew that DG would betray him at some point, that would explain why he wanted to recruit Jichang to his side. Although another reason why he did the latter could be due to the unpredictability in Goo's actions and what he intends to do. And if it was for both reasons, Charles would be losing two very important allies, but considering that Charles Choi has the power to destroy all four teams, it is very certain that he will have several people who are at the level of a King of First Generation or higher (which we currently don't know about). Which would not be unusual since Eugene himself has several allies of that caliber.
Was the death of Daniel's father a murder? Daniel's grandmother went crazy when she saw the resemblance that the latter had with Jinyoung Park. She mistook Daniel for Jinyoung and shouted, claiming that he had killed her son (Daniel's Father).
Why did James Lee change his identity to Diego Kang?  He was more than capable to take down the First Generation in their prime, now that they have aged and some lost body parts, why would he fear them?

Synopsis
Episode 58
The store begins with
Enu
, a dog who is owned by a girl. Enu is a crossbreed so she is ridiculed by her owner's friends and relatives. The girl decides to abandon Enu and keep her mother, who is a purebred. Enu remains near her owner's scarf that she threw away and refuses to let anyone nearby, hoping her owner will return to her.
At the fashion department there is a new transfer student called
Crystal Choi
. She is a short, fat girl who is not very attractive. Because of this she gets bullied.
Daniel
tries to befriend Crystal because he remembers being in her situation but she rejects him because he is handsome. Crystal thinks all handsome guys are shallow jerks.
When Crystal is walking home she spies
Vin
harassing Enu. She stands up for the dog and they begin harassing her. Daniel appears and takes interest in the dog.
Episode 59
Daniel begins treating Crystal with kindness, and other girls get jealous. They draw on her books and make fun of her secretly in front of her face. The leader of the bullies is
Yui
, who thinks Crystal is after
Zack.
Crystal goes to find Enu and feed her. Daniel arrives to do the same thing, and asks her if school life is hard. Crystal tells him she can handle it just like Enu handles her life, and Daniel begins to fall for her fat body. At nighttime, Crystal prepares to leave home in her second body, which is more attractive.
Episode 60
Crystal is the daughter of
a wealthy businessman
. She lives alone and switches between her bodies. Crystal's bodyguard
Gun
drives her to her father's meetings where she sits next to him. Guys are attracted to her, so they try to please her father. Their shallow behavior confirmed her beliefs that all handsome men are shallow.
Crystal meets Daniel at night near the convenience store. He recognizes her as the pretty girl who visits him a lot. Crystal asks if he wants to exercise with her to get stronger, and he tells her the same thing she told him. She begins to fall for his old body.
Zoe
comes to see Daniel and wonders if Crystal likes him, but she can't believe it because he is handsome. Enu sits alone in the rain and a stranger appears.
Episode 61
The stranger who appeared is Daniel. He had washed Enu's owner's scarf and brought it back to her. He makes her a cardboard house and she goes into labor. Crystal watches from afar and admires Daniel's kindness.
Crystal spends the rest of the week talking to
Kitae Hong
, the son of the H group CEO. She ends up skipping class, so she decides to go to school in her other body pretending to be her sister.
Episode 62
Crystal notices the people who were rude to her other body treating her with admiration. She is cold to them and rejects Vin's request for her number. Daniel can't stand her rudeness to people she just met and glares at her. She notices Daniel's glare and they start to resent each other.
Daniel continues to care for Enu's pups and they grow healthy. They decide to live with Daniel and Enu follows him home. Daniel can't take care of all the dogs so he is looking for a home that is close by.
Jay
volunteers to raise them, even though he is afraid of dogs.
Notes
The arc lasts at least three months, as it starts before Enu has given birth to her puppies and we later see Jay adopting the puppies when they are three months old.

Akira enters as a spy for the Workers along with Kenta Magami in the Circus, to weaken the participants who reach the last game (Catch-a-God), he shows no signs of being a spy, until he arrives at the end of the third game (Quest-ism), when he attacks Daniel, Zack and Warren. Vin Jin asks if he can join him, causing Akira to get stressed and deny him, kicking Vin's sunglasses off his face. Upon seeing Vin Jin's polycoria, Akira starts to mock Vin, enraging the high schooler and spurring him on and to fight and defeat Akira with ease, dislocating Akira's shoulder. What happened to Akira Katsuzawa after that remains unknown.

THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND
Allied (
얼라이드
)
is a crew created by
Daniel Park
right after the
Hunt for Big Deal
ended. He founded it with one goal in mind: the downfall of the
Workers
, the last of the
Four Major Crews
that was still standing. Their goal later shifted to stopping evil in Korea. Allied also joined the fight against
Gun
where they all lost.
After
Charles Choi's
death, Allied and members of the
1st Generation
went to Busan under
Diego Kang
and
Kitae Kim's
plan.
Organization
The Allied crew has no hierarchy; as Daniel has stated in the past, the members are not his subordinates or lackeys but rather equal allies (hence the name). However, Daniel is seen as the de facto leader of the alliance as he is the one calling the shots against the
Workers
.
History
With the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the
Four Major Crews
, Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers be and continue to grow in power, He decided to create a crew, with the only goal being collapse and eventual eradication of Workers.
Their base of operations takes place in an abandoned Youth Construction warehouse for the Burn Knuckles. Daniel arrived at the scene with
Zack Lee
and
Vasco
already waiting for him inside. After seeing how strong the Workers were during the
Hunt for Big Deal
, the two agreed to join his crew.
Daniel thanked them once again for joining his cause and introduced to them two more members of Allied. While they were cautious about him joining due to his social status, they welcomed
Jay Hong
to the crew. His reason for joining was to find out why Big Daniel disappeared and thought the Workers had something to do with it. The second member to join was a bit more controversial, Zack and Vasco exhibited discernible signs of discontent and dissatisfaction stemming from memories of the torment inflicted upon them during the events of the
One Night III
Arc, it was no other than the crew head of
Ansan Public
,
Hudson Ahn
. Zack and Vasco show reluctance to be associated with someone seemingly aligned with their past tormentors, Daniel explains to them why he asked him to join and tries to speak up in defense of him, However, Hudson cuts him off halfway through. He explains that he's not here to apologize or seek revenge, he believes that his crew already paid the price for attacking Seoul and he's here for revenge against Eli Jang. While they still were hesitant to let him join, after thoughtful consideration of the dangers they face as a result of their goal of bringing down Workers, they reluctantly accept Hudson's inclusion in the crew. Thus creating the Allied Crew, with its original 5 members, with the objective also to find clues where Daniel's other body was hidden by
Jinyoung Park
, one of the Pre-generation.
After the events of the
Holidays 2
and
Funeral
Arc,
Jihan Kwak
and
Jibeom Kwak
, respectively the No.1 and No.2 of the Chungcheong crew, started to help Daniel and the rest of the crew in their pursuit of eradicating Workers, as both vengeance for the death of
Jichang Kwak
, and vengeance for both
Eugene
and
Charles Choi
. They agreed to work together with Daniel and the rest of the Allied crew for the time being in order to locate
Jinyeong Park
to strategize their revenge against
Charles Choi
for killing
Jichang Kwak
and
Bakgu Noh
.
The Allied is also helped by
Jace Park
, the No.2 of
Burn Knuckles
, who acts as their tactician by providing them with information's and strategies.
And a few chapters after the
Lookism
Arc begins. Despite being rejected in
Episode 444
, Daniel was able to persuade
Vin Jin
, another very powerful figure, to join their cause as a new member of the Allied crew after presenting him the profiles of the
First Affiliate'
s Executives they will fight in their goal to abolish workers.
Alexander Hwang
began to help the team trough the Workers First Affiliate as their navigator in exchange for his freedom, putting the building's floorplans to his back.
The team is also working along with
Big Deal's
Head
Jake Kim
aiding each other in their respective goals and
Hostel
's Dad
Eli Jang
who, convinced through the efforts from
Vasco
, defected from the Workers and decided to trust the Allied by assisting them in order to defeat the organization. And by extension, also their respectively right arms Big Deal's No.2
Jerry Kwon
and Hostel's Uncle
Warren Chae
, who also defected from the Workers, associated themselves with Allied.
Busan
Daniel Park
was contacted by
DG
who told Daniel that another Four Major Crew was operating in Busan and that the appearance of
Jinrang
had united the crews. Learning this, Daniel contacted all the members of Allied and took them to Busan to take on Busan's Four Major Crews. Allied uses Vasco's connection to
Seonong Ham
in Busan to know of Choi Bongpal, one of the heads of a major crew and the one who cultivated an illicit drug business. Daniel made Allied impersonate as people from
Club Vivi
and spent enough money from Jay to convice Choi Bongpal of his identity as Club Vivi. Allied went to Choi Bongpal's hideout where they found illicit drugs and, having their cover blown, threaten Choi Bongpal of having all the drugs burned.
Choi Bongpal shows up and Allied used a very accurate Lie Detector to find her motives, she decided to help Allied as she can simply take over a crew after Allied dismantles it. She revealed intel about
Four Crews Of Busan
.

Crew Strength
Fighting Capabilities
The main crew itself is very well rounded and versatile, able to eliminate and knock out a large number of fighters, including some powerful and strong fighters like the Busan Crew Heads students and the Executives in the first affiliate.
Members and Associations
The Allied were established by
Little Daniel
himself, not just to eliminate the threat imposed by
Workers
and
Eugene
, but also stop
Charles Choi
and find clues where his other body was. After the events causing the destruction of the First Affiliate, the Allied had entered a no-aggression truce with the Workers to work towards taking down Charles Choi together.
To form the group, he first approached Vasco, who readily accepted the offer, and Zack Lee, who had just returned from training at a Buddhist temple, making them the first members to join. He also invited Jay Hong, who was searching for Big Daniel and had seemingly retrained under
Sophia
, as well as Hudson Ahn, who sought to confront Eli Jang after undergoing training with
Taesoo Ma
. Both accepted, officially establishing the team.
Jihan Kwak joined the group as well, agreeing to spy on the 1st Affiliate by infiltrating the Ambulance Response Squad, while Jibeom Kwak also became associated with them. Jace Park played a key role as the team’s tactician, providing valuable information and strategic planning.
Vin Jin initially refused to join until he discovered evidence of
Taejin Cheon
—another member of Cheonliang whom he had believed to be dead. Holding a personal vendetta against him for
Sujin Kim
’s murder and for causing the King of Cheonliang,
Seongji Yuk
, to commit suicide, Vin ultimately decided to join.
Alexander Hwang
allied with the team to help guide them through the Workers’ 1st Affiliate building. Additionally, Jake Kim and Jerry Kwon, who were seemingly wanted for the riot caused by Eugene, as well as Eli Jang and Warren Chae, who had defected from the Workers, all came to an agreement to help Daniel Park and Allied if they reach out to them.
West Gangbuk High
In the epilogue of
Questism
, another manhwa in the PTJ Universe, the Master Card reveals to Kim Soo-hyun that a "great evil" is emerging, and he will need allies to stop it. This revelation leads to the alliance between West Gangbuk High and the Allied, bringing in several formidable fighters. Among them is Gukja Yang, a distant relative of Gun Park; Hajun Gu, a promising boxer with talent on par with Zack Lee; and Jaehan Han, who assumes the role of advisor for the West Gangbuk High crew. The team also includes Yugyeom Na, a quiet yet immensely powerful kickboxer, and Haru Seong, a formidable capoeira fighter with the rare ability to copy techniques—though not to the same extent as Johan Seong or Daniel Park.

Synopsis
Like What and Hilarious are two minor characters introduced in the Runaway Fam arc. They are called such because those are phrases they repeat all the time. However, Like What's real name is Amy and Hilarious is Natalie, this was revealed during the
Workers 4 Affiliates Arc
by
Warren Chae
.
Both of the girls used to live in dysfunctional families before running away. They joined Riley's runaway fam and committed prostitution scams to earn money for themselves.
Daniel saved them from their abusive leader and they were found by Sally and Warren, who employed them in a tteokbokki restaurant. The two of them have been taken care of by Hostel B ever since.
The girls are known to be very cute as they smile, and are known to be attractive, people from the streets couldn't believe that someone like them would run away from their homes selling stuff this way. One of the guys would even want to eat Tteokbokki for every meal because of these girls.

about them during school. Jace explains the four crews are Hostel, God Dog, Big Deal and Workers. He tells Daniel that the Burn Knuckles are not a crew but can be just as powerful.
As Daniel sits on a bench he overhears his dog fighting another dog. He runs to save Enu and comes across
Johan Seong
. They apologize to each other and start running together, leaving their dogs behind. Daniel mentions the God Dogs and Johan is surprised. He asks how Daniel knows them and he explains that they are criminals. Johan suddenly asks Daniel to race, and Daniel loses the race.
Daniel is shocked that Johan won against his better body. As they catch their breath Johan asks about Daniel's family. Daniel says he has a mother and Johan says he has his dog
Eden
. They get up to leave but notice their dogs are missing and panic. Daniel and Johan find the garbageman who tells them about an animal abuser. In the abuser's home Eden and Enu observe the starving animals inside.
Episode 150
A little girl asks Daniel if she's seen her dog
Miro
, who is pregnant. Daniel replies he hasn't and is surprised to see this is a thing that happens. A later scene shows Miro being thrown out by her kidnapper. Johan is ringing doors and asking people to call him. As he runs off, a shadowy figure watches him.
Daniel and Johan approach the animal feeders and they tell them about a creepy old man who carries garbage bags. Johan remembers the old man and fears his dog is in danger. He and Daniel head up the stairs, but the second floor is barred by an iron door. Johan blasts the door open with his strength and barges into the man's room. He and Daniel see the man leaping towards them in the dark.
Episode 151
Johan grabs the old man by the collar and threatens him. The man tells him that their dogs were kidnapped by the cat lady down the street. She was an animal addict and liked to collect animals, but she failed to take care of them and they grew weak and dirty. The old man tried to stop her but he could not legally do so. While Johan and Daniel went to the man she snuck into his room and stole some more animals.
Daniel receives a call from the girl who tells him she saw a woman run off with two dogs. He and Johan race outside and begin searching. Johan calls his gang to help them search for their dogs.
Episode 152
The God Dogs
begin looking for Eden but they cannot find him. Daniel finds the woman but it isn't the right one. He heads to the kidnapper's house and pleads for her to let the dogs go. She refuses and he calls the police, but they are unable to enter her home without a warrant.
Daniel breaks the door open and releases the dogs, and the police arrive shortly after. Johan thanks Daniel for helping him and invites him to hang out in Nowon with him. His gang arrives to pick him up and Daniel is shocked to see that Johan is a God Dog.

Burn Knuckles
. Jace asks what their business is and Johan tells them to piss off. As they leave, he thinks back to when he first met Daniel. He wanted to beat Daniel for talking crap about his gang, but reconsidered after seeing how talented Daniel was. He asks
Jin Jang
to test Daniel and see if he will be a friend or a foe.
Cookie 4

Animal Instinct
is a wild mannered fighting style created by
Tom Lee
in the
0th Generation
that involves the fighter to battle without thought and only rely on instinct; as when a fighter starts thinking in battle, they lose their animal instinct. By relying on ones instincts, tools from the surrounding are often utilized to give the fighter an advantage.
Explanation
This is a martial arts style that focuses on using every part of the body and weapons to give the fighter an advantage in battle. Users will often use tools like fire extinguishers, necklaces, baton, etc. The use of weapons also means that this fighting style is designed to maim or straight up kill their opponents.
Animal Instinct targets weak points of the body like the eyes and crotch, making this a particularly immoral fighting style. A large aspect that makes animal instinct so dangerous and effective are the unpredictability elements that makes it tough to block or decipher the fighter's attacks. The user allows their instincts to guide their actions over using their brain, though this does mean that the user has to train their instincts to mimic those of animals.
Users
Tom Lee
The creator of this fighting style and master of it.
Tom Lee
often uses this in battle and incorporate things from slashing with his fingers and biting. His right hand makes his use of this style limited, but still very effective against other fighters from other
generations
.
Eli Jang
Eli primarily uses slashes from his fingers, strikes toward the weaker spots, and baton weapons to defeat his enemies. This was the first fighting style he was taught when he was a kid, making this his most comfortable fighting style.
Suhyeon Kim
Suhyeon received a
card
that allows him to use this fighting style for five minutes, boosting his attack speed and power. However, he favors other techniques, so he rarely relies on it in combat.

“
Will I really be able to make money this way...?
”
Arin, better known as TikTacTok Girl, is a minor character in Lookism introduced during the
3rd Affiliate
arc.
Appearance
Despite her poor background, she is described to be a pretty girl. She sports long straight black hair with black eyes and a pointy head shape. She has clear fair skin and sports a slender figure with a curvy waist. Similar to
Daniel
and his
mom
, she wears worn-down clothes with stains and tears everywhere, with the only decent thing in her wardrobe being her school uniform.
Personality
Arin is a polite young girl with a drive to support herself. With no parents, she works day and night to support herself financially. However, due to her passive nature and good looks, she is often the target of desperate guys who think they can take advantage of her. She never wants to cause trouble even in uncomfortable situations she is often put into. However, after Daniel stood up for her and gave he a suggestion to enter the streaming world, Arin found a new opportunity to support herself and put her drive and effort into her online career, which paid off in the end.
Relationships
Daniel Park
TikTacTok girl was at first grateful for Daniel protecting her from creeps. Following the events at Vivi's Club, they became friends and fellow Kwitch streamers.
Zoe Park
While they have not interacted for long, Zoe was suspicious of TikTacTok Girl's relationship with Daniel, and assumed that he was a player.
Synopsis
TikTacTok Girl came from a poor background. Not much is known about her past, but Doo Lee and his coworker surmise that she has likely been mistreated by men in her past due to her looks and her status.

Aru Lee
is a graduate of
PTJ Entertainment
, and a famous idol.
Appearance
Aru is a young woman with pale skin and dark colored eyes. She has dyed short copper-blonde hair which was originally black. Aru likes to wear fashionable and branded clothes with lots of accessories and jewelry.
Aru in the past.
Personality
Aru is a selfish, dishonest and absolute, bitchy person who enjoys using others for money and fame, which can also be referred to being a 'gold-digger'. She acts arrogant and enjoys regarding herself as better and more powerful than everyone else, becoming furious when she finds someone else, such as
Crystal
, who she believes is more beautiful and powerful than she is.
[
3
]
In the past, Aru was rather shy and more humble, being a poor girl from the countryside. She was deeply infatuated with Oliver and always blushed whenever she saw him and treated him with care and respect.
[
2
]
Aru was also highly generous, giving one of her most prized possessions to Lasol as a gift.
[
4
]
History
Originally from the countryside, Aru came to PTJ Entertainment to try become an idol to help financially support her family. Aru found it extremely difficult and just barely passed the weight test, going to rather extreme measures to make it.
[
2
]
Even then, no manager wanted to help Aru become an idol so Aru desperately went to an older 'sugar daddy' and mob gangster, Jin, to help her achieve her goals. Even though this meant that she would ditch Lasol and cheat on Oliver, Aru was still determined to 'reach the top'.
[

]
Relationships
Oliver Jang
Oliver and Aru used to date and they deeply cared about each other before she decided to cheat on him with a 'sugar daddy' so that she could become famous and rich.
[
5
]
Oliver hates her now and barely talks to her even though he is still fond of the times they spent together and how much they truly treated each other with love and care. He was still eager to help stop her 'sugar daddy' from forcibly taking nude photos of Aru and damaging her reputation because he understood how much her past self wanted to become an idol and support her family.
[
6
]
Lasol
Lasol and Aru used to be best friends and cared about each other deeply. Since Aru had to keep the fact that she and Oliver were dating a secret, they used Lasol as a cover to make it look like they were just friends. Now, Aru had cut her ties with Lasol because she thinks that Lasol despises her and knows about her talking to her 'sugar daddy' even though in reality, Lasol doesn't actually despise Aru.
[

DG
Aru tries to seduce DG but DG finds her annoying.

Synopsis
Episode 41
The
J High
kids go on a field trip to a retreat in the fall.
Daniel
is excited to be sitting next to friends instead of by himself.
The buses with J High freshmen inside stop at a place with games that test one's strength. Zack and Vin compete with each other to get the highest score. However, Vasco decides to join in and tells Daniel to join him. Vasco breaks the hammer game, and Daniel rips the punching bag of the punching game.
When they get to the retreat they discover there are other schools present as well. They are met by two instructors who tell them to open their bags for search.
Episode 42
They introduce themselves as Won Bin and
Heemin
, or Zeus. Won Bin is an ugly instructor so he is teased by students. Zeus is conventionally attractive so the girls fall for him.The students participate in the arts festival and everyone gets to shine.
Doo
leads Daniel down a hall to drink with the Beauty Department girls but he leaves with
Zack
to go to
Mira's
room. Daniel invites
Yui
,
Jiho
and
Zoe
as well. They decide to play a drinking game and everyone gets wasted except Mira. When Daniel wakes up to exercise his boss discovers someone is taking creepshots of the girls at the retreat.
Episode 43
The next day begins and the kids go rafting. Won Bin notices the girls laughing at Zeus when he splashes them but complaining when he does. Mira gets suspicious of Won Bin, who keeps looking at her the entire trip. Won Bin goes to the teachers room and notices them drinking. He is disgusted by their behavior and goes to find Mira.
Won Bin finds Mira in the store room helping Zeus lift some boxes. He tackles Zeus and they start fighting. Mira helps Zeus fend off Won Bin and he thanks her. Then he turns and starts acting creepy. Daniel finds in his old body a poster of Zeus as a sex offender, specifically a rapist.
The reason Won Bin had Mira's picture was because he wanted to find who was taking creepshots. He found Zeus hanging out near her and found him on the pervert website posting the creepshots. Zeus attacks Mira and tells her to take off her clothes.
Episode 44
Zeus has flashbacks to his past as a child. He was always allowed to get away with hurting others because he was handsome. Girls would cheat on their boyfriends, which fueled his perverted views on sex. He even raped girls because he believed everyone secretly liked him. Won Bin attacks Zeus and he starts beating him.
Zack asks the other students if they've seen Mira. Daniel wakes up in his other body and calls the police to report a sex offender. Zack overhears the conversation and races out the room to find Mira. He walks in to find Zeus taking off Mira's clothes and blood on her face.
Episode 45
Zack attacks Zeus and discovers he is another fighter. Zeus is trained in Muay Thai, and he breaks both his arms. Won Bin grabs the rapist and buys enough time for Zack to beat him. He does so even though his arms are broken. When Daniel and the others arrive, they find Zack is still beating Zeus.
Won Bin and Zack are taken to the emergency room and Zack needs two casts. He doesn't mind because Mira gets to feed him while he is out. Zeus goes to prison for attempted rape and is found by
Gangnam Landlord
, Zoe's old stalker, who proceeds to beat him.
Notes
The supervisor Won Bin has the same name as a famous celebrity.

episode TBA
Baekho Kwon (권백호 Kwon Baek Ho)
is Jerry Kwon's father and was Gapryong Kim's supporter. He died on the same day as Gapryong Kim

Synopsis
Jake Kim Arc
Baekho makes his first appearance
episode 312
during Samuel's flashback.
[
2
]
The Hunt for Hostel
As
Tom Lee
is walking past Jerry, he reveals that Baekho is Jerry's father and says "A sword belongs in a sheath. Like your father...".
[
3
]
This implied that Baekho and Gapryong had a similar relationship that Jake Kim and Jerry have.
The Hunt for Big Deal
Jerry is reporting to Jake all of Lua's findings on the statuses of the pre-generation. There, it is revealed that Baekho died on the same day as Gapryong Kim.
[
1
]
Although not much is mentioned about Baekho, there is a panel of him, Gapryong, young Jerry and young Jake standing in front of each other in episode 412.
[
4
]
Fighting Prowess
Not much is known about his fighting prowess in his prime (even less than
Gapryong Kim
who was the central figure of the entire generation), but it is known that the relationship shared with Gapryong was the same as
Jerry Kwon
and
Jake Kim
, and we know that with that Jerry Kwon is known/shown to have more physical strength, attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Jake, but Jake will still win the fights for 2 reasons, the 1st and main reason is that Jerry will never attack Jake and the 2nd is that Jake is much faster and more skilled than Jerry (even with Jerry mastering the fundamentals of Boxing and said by Manager Kim that he has no wasted movements and he is quite fast). So with that we can assume that while Baekho may have been more physically stronger, have higher attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Gapryong Kim, Gapryong Kim would still win the fight as he has every other stat going for him and Baekho would never have fought him. Also in chapter 456 it is shown that the strongman Jaesoo Noh who could kill boars with one ax swing with his forearm regretting and wishing hell for his luck that he got stuck with fighting with "Not fighting just anyone but Baekho Kwon's son", indicating how much of a monster in terms of strength Baekho Kwon was.
Quotes
TBA
Trivia
Baekho's name means white tiger in Korean which is also the same as the
White Tiger Job Centre (Baekho HRM)
.
Tom Lee states that Baekho Kwon was also part of the pre generation.
[

During a flashback Jerry has in episode 417 of him and Jake as children, young Jerry says that Baekho was the one who told him that Jerry was Jake's subordinate.

Noh Bagku was a member of the 0th Generation. He was
Gapryong Kim
's driver.
Appearance
TBA
Personality
TBA
Relationships
Gapryong Kim
Former superior.
Jinyoung Park
Judging from the fact Bagku called Daniel Park "Young Master" while recognizing him as someone related to Jinyoung, and judging the fact he adressed Jinyoung as "Captain", it seems the two of them got along pretty well, and that Bagku respected and valued Jinyoung.
Charles Choi
Considering the fact that the guy Bagku referred to as "The Bastard" is presumably Charles, their relationship looks rather hostile.
Bakgu and Charles held a relationship of mutual ill-will, both desiring the downfall of the other. Bakgu's negative feelings were due to Charles covering up the murder of Gapryong Kim, their former superior, while Charles actively sought out Bakgu in order to silence him.
This hatred eventually culminated in a confrontation between the two, whereupon Bakgu was shot in the head and killed by Charles using Jichang's gun, before framing Bakgu himself for instigating the incident.
Jichang Kwak
After Jichang's retirement, he became committed to helping Bakgu get his revenge on Charles Choi, even going so far as to attempt to hold Charles off so Bakgu could secure the evidence that served as Charles' weakpoint. In the end though, this attempt ended in failure as Bakgu was lured back to the scene and killed by Charles Choi, Jichang himself dying soon after.
Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Ability
Noh Bagku interrupting UI mode
Daniel
and 1st Generation King
Kwak Jichang
's fight.
Judging from the fact that he successfully stopped the fight warding off attacks from UI mode Daniel and a 1st Generation King, Kwak Jichang, who belonged to the strongest among the first-generation kings. Since he showed such a performance even at his old age, it is very likely that he was a very great fighter in his prime.

“
A man who's all power and no control... won't be very popular with the ladies.
”
— Beolgu Lee,
Ep. 453
Beolgu Lee
is a secondary character, a member of Team Shin Sera in the White Tiger Job Center
Appearance
In his youth, Beolgu was a tall and muscular man with salt-and-pepper hair styled into a messy quiff.
Currently, he is a shorter man with a pot belly, a case of crown balding, and a perpetual smile on his face.
Personality
He acts quite flirtatiously, speaking to
Hudson Ahn
about what makes a man popular with ladies.
He has stated that in his youth, he was like Hudson, but had nobody to set him on the right path.
He's also very tricky and prefers to use psychological manipulation when he can.
Relationships
Tom Lee
Both seem to know each other well, with Beolgu being part of Tom's organization, in addition to having already fought together in the Gapryong Fist.
Synopsis
Workers (1st Affiliate)
Beolgu appears with Team Sera Shin to defeat the Allied members in the
1st Affiliate
; Beolgu stays behind to defeat Hudson Ahn. Despite trying to make Hudson doubt his path by lying to him, his words end up having the opposite effect, making Hudson strong enough to beat Beolgu.
Fighting Prowess
Beolgu Lee is considerably strong, taking into account that he is a member of the 0th Generation, in addition to claiming to have beaten
Taesoo Ma
in his prime before he lost to
James Lee
and lost his eye. However, due to his seeming surprise when he experiences Taesoo's fighting style in episode 454, when combined with his personality, it is likely this is a lie.
Having previously been a street vendor, he is beyond skilled in lying. He does background research on his opponent before their fight and makes up lies to make his opponent lose their will to fight. He then toys with and crushes his psychologically weakened opponent.
This strategy does not work well against those of strong moral principles however, as evidenced by his defeat in his prime at the hands of Gapryong Kim and, in the modern day, at the hands of Hudson Ahn.

Xiaolong recruited many of the other members into the Bicheon Gang. Huseong Ha's gang was bought monetarily. Taegon Wi, Hwang Ho and Sowol Jin were scouted personally for their talent. Xiaolong also helped train much of the later Bicheon gang, the majority of whom were victims from a large fire.

FOR THE BIG DEAL WAY
Big Deal
were members of the
Four Major Crews
. They reside in Gangseo, west of the Han River. They are led by
Jake Kim
.
History
Big Deal is a gang with history in Gangseo. Not much is known about their origins except that they have been there for a while. Sinu Han took over the gang as a child and made some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.
When Jake Kim was third in command he was in a dispute with the leader of Big Deal, Sinu Han, who chose to sell Big Deal to the Workers for extra money. Jake decided against it, and won the favor of the rest of Big Deal. Since then, he has been the leader of Big Deal. His caring demeanor to his subordinates makes Big Deal one of the most loyal out of the 4 big crews. Only later did Jake learn that Sinu Han did not mean to sell Big Deal, but decided to sell himself to the Workers instead. Since then, Jake has worked hard to bring Sinu back from the Workers and fulfill Gun's requirements to be a potential successor.
Organization
Big Deal's organization is a number system, with a lower number being more important. Jake Kim used to be the leader of the YB branch, but since then Big Deal has dissolved into one large association. The previous No.1
Big Boss
and No. 2
Old Face
have been removed when Big Deal made Jake Kim their leader. After the dissolution of
God Dog
, the remaining members under Jin Jang joined Big Deal. Since then however, they have abandoned the crew to join the
Workers
.
Big Deal is the most romantic of the four crews. They do not fight dirty, and they don't accept people who do so.

Jake has however briefly taken an interest in
Jiho Park
, but he did not end up joining the crew.

Brekdak
(
쁘랙딱
), (
สมศักดิ์ คำแสง, Somsak Kamsaeng)
is a supporting character. He is an immigrant worker from Thailand resigned to working many degrading jobs in order to pay off his debt and provide for his family back home. However, at the same time, Brekdak is a Muay Thai champion with a highly decorated record whom retired after killing an opponent in the ring. Now, he is Vasco's Muay Thai teacher and runs various small businesses.
Appearance
Brekdak is an unassuming man of Thai descent. He possesses dark skin, short and spiky hair, and is of average height. Throughout the series, he is forced to wear a variety of clothing ranging from stereotypical Vietnamese attire to stylish clothing.
However, Brekdak without a shirt is revealed to possess highly developed musculature, notably having a very wide back.
Personality
Brekdak is a kind, unassuming man with a hard-working personality and distaste towards violence if it can be avoided. He is notably motivated primarily by his family and love of Muay Thai in all his endeavours, going so far as to allow himself to be degraded on a daily basis in order to earn money to support his family.
Fighting Prowess
Brekdak is implied to be the premier Muay Thai fighter in the world, despite being retired. His prowess is such that he is not only acknowledged by
Gun
, but has Gun as his fan.
Due to his tutelage of Vasco, it can be assumed that all of Vasco's current techniques is comparable or even inferior to Brekdak's with many of Brekdak's personal and "Forbidden Techniques" being among the more powerful techniques in Lookism.

Trivia
Brekdak's original name neither recognizes by Thai readers nor sounds like one at all. Instead, in the Thai translation, he is given a new full name, สมศักดิ์ คำแสง (Somsak Kamsaeng).
His name is a parody of Thai kickboxing champion
Somluck Kamsing
, while his appearance resembles another Muay Thai fighter,
Buakaw Banchamek
.
Gun
is a fan of Brekdak, breaking his egotistical and sadistic persona to show reverance for and ask for Brekdak's autograph when the two met.
Many of Brekdak's "Forbidden Techniques" resemble techniques from Muay Boran rather than Muay Thai with Muay Boran being the primogenitor of Muay Thai exclusively based in military applications.
This is evidenced by many of the techniques utilising movements which are much more acrobatic in nature along with targeting areas of the body with the intent of murdering or disabling the opponent such as elbowing to the neck.
Brekdak's most common businesses involve selling food. In particular, he has sold Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food.

Burn Knuckles
is a gang located in Central Seoul. It is made of members of the Architecture Department in
J High.
Their leader is Vasco.
History
The Burn Knuckles was founded by
Vasco
during his first year in high school. The story goes that he would grab delinquents by the shoulder and warn them to stop smoking. The students were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department and join the first generation of Burn Knuckles. Since then, underclassmen have also joined to form the second generation of Burn Knuckles.
The purpose of the Burn Knuckles is to protect. Vasco believes that power exists to protect the weak. The Burn Knuckles abide by that principle strictly, and are very loyal to Vasco. They will not fight unless he gives the order to. Their strength and loyalty has led some characters like
Daniel
to compare Burn Knuckles to the four crews, but
Jace
disagrees with this comparison, stating that the Burn Knuckles are only friends of Vasco and nothing more.
The Burn Knuckles' location in Central Seoul has led to the four crews being hesitant to establish main operations there. However, this has not stopped gangs like
Big Deal
and
God Dog
from attempting to take over Central Seoul. In the God Dog Arc, Vasco swore to help Daniel defeat the four crews alongside him. Since then, the Burn Knuckles have been antagonistic towards the four crews.
Organization
Vasco is the leader and the founder of the Burn Knuckles, and is their main source of strength. Aside from him, Burn Knuckles have seven executive members called the Seven Meisters. They are also known as the "Tool Council" because they all carry a tool of some kind; whether this is because of their status as Architecture students is unknown. The seven are listed below:
"Monkey Spanner"
Jace Park
(Burn Knuckles Strategist, & Second in Command)
"Seoul Tour Helper"
Woong
"The Nutcracker"
Ira Oh
"Crying Hammer"
Mason Hwang
"Flying Nipper"
Jimmy Wang
"Cute Duck"
Damon Goh
"Safety Helmet"
Seongryong Choi
The Burn Knuckles used to have black leather jackets as their uniform. Freshman Burn Knuckles wear blue jumpsuits. Sophomore Burn Knuckles used to wear grey, but now wear orange jumpsuits.

--- FILE: Busan's_Four_Major_Crews.txt ---
The
Busan's Four Major Crews
are a form of organization of the Busan territory into four gangs, this model which was based on the way used by Charles Choi to raise money through the
Four Major Crews of Seoul
.
These crews are extremely feared among the Busan region, and even mentioning them can bring tension to Busan residents. These four crews are commanded by five dangerous individuals, whose fighting skills are known to be high.
Currently, there are rumors that these crews were unified through a man who was recently released from prison:
Jinrang
.
History
To be added...
Organization
Busan is separated into 4 areas, also called "Turfs", these areas are numbered from 1 to 4. Each of these areas is organized by a specific crew, with each crew having someone as its head.
In total, there are 5 heads for the 4 areas, with Area 1 having one more head. It is possible to determine the head of that area by means of a silver ring with the symbol of Busan that they are often wearing.
In the case of Jinrang, who recently became the leader of these unified crews, he wears a golden ring with the symbol of Busan.
Area 1
Area 1 is widely known for its "roombar" business. A roombar is an adult entertainment establishment where customers can pay to drink and chat in private rooms with hostesses.
This business is managed by
Arin Shin
and
Jihoon Min
. Currently, Area 1 is facing problems with the emergence of a karaoke bar in the area, managed by
Hudson Ahn
and owned by
Ansan Public
.
Area 2
In Area 2, there are several pubs, pubs that have several tables to play the game of "hold 'em" poker. Even though pubs with these games are legal, bars are not, and this is what they do away from the spotlight: several bars that play poker illegally, due to the clarification of the rules, apparently they also offer some in-house system in these bars to help players to continue betting.
Its head is
Hyukjin Park
.
Area 3
Area 3 is directly connected to Busan ports. There, they smuggle young foreign girls, this business is the one that generates the most money among all the Four Big Groups in Busan.
His methods are brutal and cruel, he smuggles young girls by hiding them on ships. When the police are about to catch them, they hide the crime by sinking the ship, along with the smuggled girls in the cold ocean.
Its head is
Sangjin Hyun
.
Area 4
Area 4 has a more direct business: clandestine fights. Initially the place was used to resolve disputes between sailors, but it ended up becoming more and more popular, to the point where most people in the region know about the Arena.
It is implied that there are several categories of fights in the Arena, such as fights with bladed weapons or bare hands. Fights are normally carried out one-on-one, with no rules or restrictions on techniques to be used against the opponent. The people watching then choose a fighter that they think will be the winner, and then bet on him, thus, the winnings go to the fighter, and possibly part also goes to whoever is organizing the fight, thus sustaining the Area's business.
Its head is
Jinchan Kang
, who is also the Arena champion.

Charles Choi
(최동수
Choi Dong Soo
)
, also known as
Elite
, is the main antagonist of
Lookism
. He was the father of Crystal Choi and the CEO of HNH Group, a conglomerate company that owned many smaller businesses. He was one of the few people that knew about
Daniel
and Crystal's secret. During the
1st Generation
, Charles Choi used
DG
to kill
Gapryong Kim
. This incident was completely hidden, according to
Eugene
, it was the incident with the murder of
Baekho Kwon
and Gapryong Kim that was Charles' weakness. He also has been implied to have killed
Daniel's father
.
After the incidents of
The Hunt for Gun
, it was revealed through the Red Paper that Charles Choi worked with the
Yamazaki Clan
during the
0th Generation
which led to Charles Choi jumping from the top of Gun's hideout and committing suicide in front of the whole world. It was also revealed that reveal of the red paper and his death was part of Charles' plan.
Appearance
Charles was a tall and muscular middle-aged man with sunken black eyes, sharp eyebrows, a white beard and slicked hair that was graying wih age, his outfit consisted in a white polo shirt with a black tie with black stripes under a dark gray business suit and black shoes. In his introduction, Charles wears a navy blue tie with white stripes and a beige business suit with brown shoes under a carmine red cloak, as well a black tank top shirt under a black pair of pants and sports jacket with white stripes.
In his youth, Charles used to wear round glasses and have a black hair styled in a fringe, as well a light gray sweater under a pair of white suspenders and white pants with black stripes
Personality
He exerted an air of authority as he was able to silence anyone simply by walking through the room. He seemed to be extremely shrewd. He is said to have betrayed Gapryong Kim by siding with the Yamazaki Syndicate during the 0th Generation.
Fighting Prowess
During his youth, Elite was the second in command of
Gapryong Kim
's fist, mastering a technique that around only one person per generation would be able to master. Known as
Invisible Attacks
, it is described as attacking your opponents blind spots so fast, the attacks become invisible to the eye, becoming a threat to Gapryong Kim at the time. His variation of Invisible Attacks involves kicking and attacking the back of the head of the opponent.
Charles is also a master strategist, being able to outwit and kill both
Jichang Kwak
and
Noh Bakgu
.
However, due to old age and health problems, and his amputated arm, he has been unable to properly utilise his Invisible Attacks properly. Despite this, he was still able to overpower Jichang Kwak, and take down "No.1" of the Workers' First Affiliate with ease.
Quotes
"
Do you think, a snake could slay a tiger?
"
Trivia
Despite being introduced in chapter 108, his name was not revealed until chapter 262.
He was the one to create the
Four Major Crews
, with the help of
DG
,
Gun
and
Goo
and the other
Ten Geniuses
.
He was the Second-in-Command of Gapryong's Fist Gang in the pre-generation. He went by the name of
Elite
.
He used to live in Daniel's current house, before he became successful.
There are speculations of
DG
being his second body, that he exploited to defeat multiple first generation fighters, as well as murder Gapryong Kim and Baekho Kwon.
Charles Choi is the one who created the two body system, as revealed by
Jinyeong Park
.
Charles Choi has committed treason by siding with the Yakuza, the underworld of Japan.
He met
Gun Park
when he was a cleaner in a juvenile prison.

Crystal Choi
He is Crystal's father, and is the only person who knows the fact that she has two bodies. He has also ordered Crystal to keep an eye on Daniel, presumably because he doesn't want him to mess up and reveal his secret.
Ten Geniuses
DG
In Chapter 108, DG stands up for Charles, saying that Charles had been the one who had taken care of him ever since he was young. Charles also makes him the CEO of
PTJ Entertainment
.
He is referenced as being one of Charles Choi's weaknesses, as Charles helped to cover up DG's involvement in one of South Korea's most infamous murder cases, the murder of
Gapryong Kim
.
Gun Park
Charles met Gun while working in juvenile prison. He hired him for his fighting prowess. Later on, he hired Gun to be Crystal's bodyguard.
Goo Kim
Several years prior to the series, Charles sent Gun to test Goo to see if he had potential to become Gun's partner. He later hired him to be his bodyguard. Currently, he is suspicious that Goo is collaborating with Workers in an effort to take him down.
Pre-Generation
Jinyoung Park
The two were both comrades working alongside each other. When Charles' old name "Elite" was brought up to the current Jinyoung in ep. 403, it sent him into a frenzy.
[

]
Tom Lee
Charles shows respect to his longtime partner, showing that he can count on him for whatever is needed.
Gapryong Kim
It is not known what happened between the two, but it appears that at some point, Charles began to disagree with Grapryong.
Other
Daniel Park
After Daniel (old body) is lead back to his own house after investigating the true identity of his new body, Charles is seen waiting for Daniel at his house. He begins to attack Daniel who is easily defeated, and says to him that James Lee doesn't exist, and that it was all fabricated to keep his secret safe. Then, after Daniel asks to know why he has the new body, he says that he would have to surpass DG.
Jake Kim
Charles is initially indifferent towards Jake, sometimes even underestimating him, but seems to admire him for his resemblance to his father.
Steve Hong
He and Steve are both CEOs, and they have known each other for a long time, but are not friends.

Background
Charles' past is shrouded in mystery, but we know that he was one of the key figures of the
0th Generation
, fighting side by side with
Gapryong Kim
. Charles grew up in a wealthy family that ran a business, but soon after Charles was born, his family went bankrupt and took a mysterious photo near his supermarket, according to
DG
, this photo is the solution to the mystery of two bodies, which
Daniel Park
and James Lee have not yet been able to solve. The abandoned school that Daniel Park attended occupies a special place in Charles' life, he studied at this school, it contains both good and bad memories, then the photo was stored in this school until Daniel Park got there.
During the
1st Generation
, Charles Choi used
DG
to kill
Gapryong Kim
. This incident was completely hidden, according to
Eugene
, it was the incident with the murder of
Baekho Kwon
and
Gapryong Kim
that was Charles' weakness.
According to Crystal, Charles is raising ten children, referred to as the "ten geniuses", alongside her. Each of these children were chosen for their unique skills and are being groomed to be successful in their respective fields. Of these children are
Gun
,
Goo
,
Kouji
,
Crystal
,
DG
,
Tom Lee
and
Jinyoung Park
.
He created the 4 crews to fund his main business which is unknown at the moment but through backstory we learn that DG, Goo, Gun, and Tom Lee created/immersed the 4 gangs into their plan of funding. Each gang is to bring in 100 million won every month, and there is 4 gangs, which equates to 4.8 billion won. His true objective is unknown right now

“
This was once home home to a great man, leagues above the likes of you.
We will not giving up Cheonliang to anyone
”
— Vin Jin,
Ep. 500
The
Cheonliang Fam
are minor antagonists in Lookism and former mercenaries of
Hostel A.
Their former teacher was
Seongji Yuk
.
History
The Cheonliang Fam are one of the most feared gangs in Cheonliang. They wear sunglasses
for a compromise
and always travel in groups of four.
[
1
]
One of their initiation rituals is a fight involving wrestling on broken glass. The winner of the fight was
Vin Jin
, who became their leader for some time.
[
2
]
The remaining members of the Cheonliang Fam seem to have a grudge against Vin. He and
Mary Kim
used to be very powerful in the region before Vin left for Seoul to become a rapper. MC Pesticides is also terrified of Mary Kim, although she was eager to see him. The rest of the members of the gang have a friendly relationship with Mary.
[

]
In Chapter 483, the Fam is revealed to have been formed by Seongji Yuk as a sort of resistance to the belief in
Cheonliang's shaman

Synopsis
Episode 325
Daniel has lost a lot of weight since training with
Sophia
and he is starting to see positive results. As he is stepping out of the house he smells soap in the air, and a girl his age passes by.
Doo Lee and Alexander Hwang are getting yelled at for talking too much while working. Doo was taken from the fourth affiliate to work in the third affiliate's cleanup crew. Alexander was sent to the third affiliate to do odd jobs after being taken by
Tom Lee
. Daniel runs into them crying on the road and decides to buy them some fried chicken. He is reminded of
Like What
and
Hilarious
and sees one of the waitresses being harassed by her boss. Daniel intercepts the boss as he tries to grab the girl, and the boss moves away. He tells the girl she should try making money in other avenues, and that he knows a guy (himself) who made it large using TikTacTok.
Johan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers. Daniel hands Jake his ID, which says he is 90 years old. Jake tells Daniel minors aren't allowed inside, and Daniel reveals his black VVIP badge.
Episode 326
Jake believes Daniel must know something about
Sinu Han
since he is a VVIP. He tries to send a signal by sneezing, and Daniel doesn't understand but tries to send his own signals asking about drugs and secrets of the third affiliate.
Vivi's friends Antonio, Michael and Jonathan ask her why she is working in the club, and she tells them about how difficult it is to sell and use drugs in China compared to Korea. They ask her about her other drug business, Pungsan. Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
Jake and Daniel are finding it difficult to tease information out of each other. Jake gives up and asks Daniel to ask the president about Sinu Han if he sees them, because Sinu is his long lost brother. Daniel says he will, and they go to ask Xiaolong to see the president since he is a VVIP. Vivi and her friends are high in a room lined with mushrooms, so Xiaolong denies them. Daniel says he'll report this to the Workers and Xiaolong grabs him by the neck, saying he doesn't care if Daniel is a VVIP or not, he can always go back to China. Daniel escapes the choke and asks Xiaolong if there are drugs inside that room.
Episode 327
Xiaolong considers killing Daniel, and that it would bring a lot of trouble. He eventually lets Daniel and Jake inside the room, which is now completely empty. They search but they don't find any trace of drugs or Sinu. Daniel suspects a secret room is inside there. Alexander Hwang tells him that Vivi only meets with the super rich and influential, so it will be difficult to talk with her. He asks why Daniel is acting poor when he can pay with his black badge. Daniel starts paying for everyone's drinks and the club starts getting wild.
Johan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him. All of the expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol asks Daniel to come to the president. He comes to a room with several influencers sitting around sweets, along with TikTacTok girl. He eats some of the cookies and asks them where the drugs are, and they tell him that he just ate the drugs: Vivi bakes them into cookies called "Vivi cookies". Daniel faints and wakes up in his second body that he rushes into the club with.
Episode 328
TikTacTok girl tries help Daniel but everyone around her is drunk. Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and orders her to get wasted as well. Daniel enters the room to find it's emptied out. Xiaolong tells Daniel he was expecting him to attack the third affiliate, and Jake knocks him out despite taking a heavy blow from Daniel.
Daniel wakes up in a hotel room where Vivi asks if he's okay. He asks why she cares about him and she tells him her dad said to befriend any billionaire's kid, so she can make friends. When he asks about TikTacTok girl Vivi says if he likes her he can be a part of the treasure hunt she set up with her friends. These rich kids invite influencers they fancy so they can assault them while they are unconscious. Daniel beats the guys and raises his fist at Vivi in anger when Taegon Wi, another Workers executive, throws a kunai at him. The other kids' guards rush in to say that Daniel isn't the son of a billionaire, but an unknown person. Daniel says the third affiliate is rejected from the four crews.
Episode 329
Taegon Wi, also known as "King Gon", had fought with
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
before. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it. He chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.
Jake tells Daniel that he is in the VIP room where they grow hallucinogenic mushrooms, what he suspects is the third affiliate's illegal activity. He also tells Daniel that he found out the secret of the room while Alexander was flipping tables: that the room itself rotates. Daniel tells Jake that in the rooms above the club influencers are drugged and taken advantage of. He begs Jake to save them and Jake says he doesn't care, he is only interested in finding Sinu. He switches off with Johan as bouncer but starts to remember Daniel's words. He calls Big Deal and asks them to send two people over, knowing Sinu would have probably wanted that. Jake and Lineman show up to the club.

“
Copy without talent is nothing but a cheap facsmile.
”
— Jinyeong Park,
Ep. 461
"Can you copy the generations I've lived through?" - Jinyeong Park, the first Copy user since the History of the Fist
The "Copy" Technique is a very unique and a one-in-a-million Technique that is only present in less than a handful of Fighters across the three generations. This Technique allows the user to replicate the move based on memory, with flawless execution. This is an extremely rare talent that has never surfaced in the First Generation (from knowledge), and only has been seen in the
0th
and the
2nd
. Not even Tom Lee, the
Genius of Fighting
, possesses this ability
Explanation
The copy ability allows its user to perfectly replicate in a 1:1 way the movement he has observed, this makes those who possess this technique extremely dangerous, being able to increase their strength while fighting against powerful opponents. Furthermore, copying is not limited to whoever originally possessed the technique/fighting style, a Copycat if he meets another Copycat, one can copy each other's techniques as well.
It is implied that this talent is heriditary in both the Park and Seong family, as uncle-nephew duo Jinyoung and Daniel Park, and relatives Johan and Haru Seong possess this ability.
Difference between "Copy" and "Imitation"
As said by
Jinyeong Park
, not everyone can simply use this technique, as copying requires talent to do so. In other words, a fighter who does what his opponent just did is not necessarily a Copycat, for example;
Kitae Kim
can try to copy
Jichang's
Hand Blades, or even the strength of his father,
Gapryong Kim
, but this is nothing more than a cheap imitation.
Types of Copy
There are two forms of copies; the copying of a technique and the copy of an individual's physique.
Technique Copy
Daniel Park's 2nd body copying Hard Fist
This type of copy is the most used, allowing the user to perform and execute a movement that they have seen. However, there are fighting techniques/styles that require more specific training, therefore making this technique difficult to copy. For example; in his original body,
Daniel Park
couldn't copy
Taesoo Ma's
Hard Fist and other
1st Generation Kings'
fighting styles, so he had to undergo training to make his body fit for it.
This use of the Copy cannot fully 1:1 replicate the
true essence
of a strike. Even with the perfect body, Daniel Park is unable to replicate the essence of
Gongseob Ji
's domain of one step,
Taesoo Ma
's Ultimate Fist and
Jinrang
's Conviction.
Infinite Technique
Johan Seong's library of copied fighting styles, integrated into one
Johan Seong's awakened variation of the Copy Technique: he is able to integrate a collection of fighting styles into a simple strike, allowing it numerous strike arcs, landing even when it does not directly hit.
Physical Copy
Johan Seong copying Daniel Park's second body
This type of copy allows its user to imitate the physique of extremely powerful individuals for a short period of time/attacks. For example;
Johan Seong
used this copying ability to imitate Daniel Park's perfect body in
Ultra Instinct
for 10 seconds, or
Jinyeong Park
copying
Gapryong Kim's
Innate Strength
and Fighting Style for three attacks.
Therefore, it is extremely dangerous to try to go beyond the limits of this copy, when a Copycat tries to go beyond the safe limit of this copy, the feeling is as if their body is shattering and breaking into pieces.

--- FILE: CQC.txt ---
CQC(Close-Quarter-Combat) is a highly sophisticated military martial arts technique, pioneered by the South Korean Military,  which involves attacking the opponent's vital spots in a repeated fashion, as long as the opponent is within the user's radius of attack.
Many
copycats
and characters from the Manager Kim spinoff webtoon also utilise this technique.
Explanation
This is a martial technique used by the military to neutralize threats within a radius of up to 100 feet (about 30 meters).
Within Webtoon, CQC is widely used thanks to its precision and range of techniques.
Notable Users
Warren Chae
Warren, under the guidance and training of Manager Kim, was able to master CQC and combine it with his
Jeet Kune Do
to create a new variation of the technique, that was even able to knock down
Jerry Kwon
and deal damage to
Gun Park
.
Manager Kim
A great practicioner of this technique, he has developed it so much that he has many variations of it, which include not limited to Guns, Daggers and Steel Wire,
He is Warren Chae's teacher.

Synopsis
Episode 161
Crystal
observes CCTV footage
Kouji
stole from the convenience store and discovers
Duke
took the place of Daniel's original body to cover for him. She suspects
Daniel
of having two bodies. She tries to catch him cheating during the exam but he doesn't and takes it all in one go.
Crystal runs into
Enu
and then Daniel. He asks if she can help him pick out women's clothes and she takes him for a player until he says they are for his mother. Crystal wonders if Daniel dresses nicely to attract attention in his second form, but she is horrified to discover he has a bad fashion sense. Crystal decides to pick out Daniel's clothing.
Jay
notices and is hurt.
Crystal runs to the convenience store and orders Daniel to call the other Daniel.
Episode 162
Daniel tells her the other Daniel is in a video with Duke, and she suspects it is prerecorded. However, the other Daniel picks up the phone. Crystal is shocked to see Daniel does not have two bodies. She runs to Duke's house and spots them in real time, proving they are two different people.
At the convenience store,
Vasco
is training with Daniel when another one comes in. Daniel's friends are shocked but then he explains that
his cousin Dylan
was substituting for him because they look alike. He worked out with Vasco because he was terrified he was a thug, and he looked enough like Daniel to fool them. The only one not fooled was
Zoe
.
Cookie 1
Daniel is shocked to see another stack of clothes from Jay, who was presumable jealous of Crystal. Jay exercises out of stress. When Daniel sees Jay at school he gives him his terrible outfit to thank him for the clothes. Jay decides to wear it everywhere.
Cookie 2
Johan
tells
Jin Jang
about Daniel, saying he wants to know his intentions. Jin Jang places advertisements to buy bank accounts all over Seoul, claiming the region is theirs to take.

In her original "attractive" body, Crystal possesses unrivaled beauty within the series and this, coupled with her status as the HNH chairman's daughter, is usually enough to mark her reputation and status of importance as well above others. Even
Aru Lee
, a famous idol star, couldn't help but feel jealousy towards the difference in their status as
DG
diligently attended to Crystal's every need, yet wouldn't even bat an eye for Aru.

Crystal is also fairly tall in this body, with a curvy physique. Ever since Crystal drastically transformed from her past overweight self, she became the sexiest, hottest and most gorgeous girl in the country. So immensely beautiful and attractive that she could have any guy in the country if she wanted.
Crystal keeping track of her unhealthy diet.
In Chapter 60, Crystal recounts her journey from feeling overlooked and unattractive due to her weight and says that she could never imagine being treated with kindness and admiration in the past as she experiences them when she drastically changes and becomes very attractive. This shift has left her skeptical of people's motives when they treat her humanely and kindly. She reveals the extreme lengths she went to in order to transform herself citing that she “almost killed herself to change”, admitting to contemplating drastic measures. Her meticulous tracking of calorie intake and strict adherence to a potentially unhealthy diet regimen underscore the lengths she goes to maintain her current appearance. Crystal wishes she didn’t have to endure a hellish life all over again as she ventures on to keep an eye on Daniel through her alternate, unattractive body, as per her father’s orders.
Crystal has an immensely good fashion sense, in direct contrast with Daniel, who has terrible fashion sense and only maintains his stunningly fashionable looks with the help of
Jay Hong
.

]
Crystal is very knowledgeable in fashion, even schooling Daniel when she was annoyed at his poor fashion sense despite him being in the fashion department. Crystal seems to prefer dressing in style while in her original attractive body, which may be why she assumed Park Daniel did the same as well (when she was suspicious of him having two bodies). She generally uses this body to attend business related events and issues. Crystal works out quite a lot to maintain this body rather than the unattractive body which indicates that this is her real body.
Alternate Body
In her “unattractive” alternate body, Crystal is strikingly similar to
Daniel Park
in his original body (before he lost weight), to the point that it's as if she was the female version of him. Crystal is obese and quite short in this form, approximately the same height as Daniel in the past. Much like Daniel, she is also referred to as 'Pig' by many people due to her size and height; usually girls who are jealous of her getting attention from Daniel in his second body.
Crystal recounts her exhaustive efforts to alter her physical appearance in this body through all sorts of diets and workout regimens. She was unsuccessful at losing even a bit of weight, henceforth implying that this her alternate body.
She has been shown to have a prowess in fighting while in this body as well, as she is seen beating up some bullies during the Picnic Arc in Chapter 144. She has also used the two body system to cheat on exams to get high marks; however, unlike Daniel, she seems to have no shame in using it this way. This could be due to the influence of her father, who shames Daniel for wasting his "gift".
Crystal mostly uses this body for school related events and issues to keep watch of Daniel.
Personality
Crystal's views of men around her.
[
5
]
Irrespective of what form she is in, Crystal harbors a prejudice towards attractive people, mostly due to how people used to treat her in her past when she was “unattractive” and overweight. She faces the same treatment in her alternate “unattractive” body (that she cannot change since it’s her second body) often being called her derogatory terms, being ostracized and bullied.
She developed a cynical outlook towards attractive people, due to how many times she has been humiliated by their fake kindness towards her Unattractive Body. This cynical outlook isn't just exclusive towards attractive people, it also extends towards all people in general—this is because Crystal is the daughter of
Charles Choi
, and as his daughter, Crystal has a lot of suitors due to her power and looks. As a result, she tends to generalize attractive people to be egotistical, and believe people to be shallow and superficial.
This belief and experiences led Crystal to close off her heart, finding comfort in being alone and genuinely not wanting to rely on other people. This belief also led to her initial distrust of Daniel, initially responding to his friendly actions with caution and politeness, and pushing him away from her because his presence and compassion towards her Unattractive Body at school is causing other girls to bully her.
Despite Crystal's prejudices and cynical outlook towards other people, she is a kind person at heart. She feeds and take care of
Enu
regularly alongside Daniel. She also helped them during the
Illegal Toto Arc
using her Attractive Body which surprised
Kouji
, stating that she had never bothered to help others before.
[

]
Crystal is slowly but surely maturing as she interacts more with Daniel and his clique and becoming less and less prejudiced.
Fighting Prowess
As
Charles Choi
’s daughter and under the protection of the likes of
Jong Gun
and previously
Goo Kim
, she does not have to fight very often, even though she has shown to be quite formidable in her own right. Gun, the training genius, has undertook her training. Although Crystal seems well versed in all sorts of martial arts-even showcasing Kyokushin Karate, Boxing as well as Aikido, and how she seems to quickly identify
Eli Jang
's moves and tries to find any correlation to the many martial arts she knows, it seems that she has only ever used and possibly learnt it for the sake of self-defence, which is the reason we are yet to see the extent of her full capabilities in combat.
However as she carries the blood of Charles Choi, or Elite, the Second-in-Command or the Underboss of Gapryong Kim’s Fist Gang in the Pre-Generation, she seems to have potential by her superior genes.
Original Body
Crystal using Gun's Aikido on Matt Kang.
At some point, Crystal was trained by
Jong Gun
on how to fight and is fully capable of taking care of herself.
[
7
]
The extent of her ability in combat has yet to be explored as she rarely ever has to fight in this body, but since she was trained by a legendary fighter it can be assumed she is a formidable fighter in her own right.
Crystal first fought when she beat and kicked Daniel’s stalker using
Jong Gun
’s training in the Stalker arc in Chapter 120
[
8
]
. Crystal was able to knock Daniel’s stalker who was wielding a taser, using a Kyokushin Karate kick.
Crystal has also showed enough strength to skillfully knock out Matt Kang, the boss of a small crew based in Cheonliang, for bothering her friends and herself, using the Corkscrew Blow and Gun’s Aikido move, during the Hostel Branch arc in Chapter 258
[
9
]
.
Alternate Body
Despite the hinderance of the height and weight of her alternative body, she is capable of doing jump kicks and was shown beating up three bullies in a bathroom for bothering Zoe, Mira and Yui during the Picnic arc in Chapter 144.

Family
Charles Choi
Charles is her father and he is the only one who knows the fact she has two bodies. He also ordered her to keep an eye on Daniel,  because he knows Daniel has two bodies as well.
As shown, despite caring for her father, Crystal was not blind to his faults and of how selfish and evil he was. This was shown during his funeral, where Crystal acknowledged that even though her father had so many working under him and had met so many people in his life, no one bothered to go to his funeral. A fact that Crystal found both heartbreaking, but fair, as he had hurt, used and abused so many people during his life and earned the justified hatred of many as well.
Friends
Kouji
Kouji and Crystal know each other well because Kouji is one of the ten people who were raised by Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. These ten special children are considered prodigies under his care. Even though the two know each other substantially well, they hardly meet unless Crystal needs Kouji's assistance in an emergency or any similar matter. Their relationship is based on money as he will only do her bidding if he makes a profit off of the work.
DG
DG and Crystal are close acquaintances and know each other quite well because of Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. His friendship with Crystal surprises many girls since he doesn't show any obvious kindliness to any other girl. Despite being very close to each other, DG and Crystal have no romance in their relationship.

Background
As the daughter of the HNH Group Chairman,
Charles Choi
, Crystal comes from a very wealthy background. However this was not always the case. Crystal seems to have grown up poor for majority of her life, before her father made his business successful. This is implied when she tells Daniel that she used to live under similar conditions as him, as well as looking into her father's own background. She is one of the few raised by the chairman of HNH Group,
Charles Choi
, as well as the only legitimate child and daughter. Crystal (much like Daniel) also has two bodies.
At some point, her father tasked her with keeping an eye on Daniel, which is why she transferred to Jae Won High in her alternate body while her original body is usually attending to her other issues after dusk, usually tending to business related issues.

Synopsis
Episode 132
Johan Seong
used to be childhood friends with
Zack
and
Mira
, going to church and school with them. He was a very religious child like
his mother
, and tries to please her by not fighting. However, he still gets bullied in school because he is poor and weak. Usually Zack saves him from his bullies, and Johan is embarrassed whenever Mira sees this because he has a crush on Mira.
The reason Johan refuses to let his friends visit is because his mom is delusional. His mother after a period of time lost her sight and while losing her sight she entered a cult for a dog god. His mother rants about being one of the chosen for the 666 and becomes violent, and he doesn't want his friends to see her in that state.
Episode 133
Johan is jealous of Zack's fighting ability and wishes he was as popular. When he spots Mira he gets embarrassed and runs away from her, expecting her to leave him alone. Mira decides to visit him anyway, and his mother invites her to visit a new church called "Eden" that she joined.
Johan confides in
a priest
and tells him he suspects his mother is in a cult. The priest decides to accompany him to keep an eye on his mother. Zack tags along as well, to hang out with Mira. In the cult a man is tied to a cross and is desperate to escape the cult.
Episode 134
The four of them set off to the cult and Zack is attacked by a dog. He is saved by the priest, who is suspicious of the place. They learn that children and adults are going to be separated, and Johan is nervous. When they get to the kids place they discover the kids are friendly. Johan decides to tell Zack his secret.
Zack is angry at Johan for endangering them all. He reveals that he knows Johan has a crush on Mira, and he was working hard to beat Johan. The two of them spot the man on the cross and go to investigate. Back at the kids section Mira discovers the kids are psychopaths who like killing cockroaches. They invite her to play the game and try to force feed her cockroaches.
Episode 135
They worked together untying the person on the cross and it was later revealed he was a reporter that wanted to write an article about the illicit dog cult. Zack goes back to save Mira and Johan is impressed by his fighting skill. The reporter tells them to meet him when they save their friend, but instead they go to the priest to warn him about the cult. The reporter is shocked to see they brought the priest, because he is the leader of the cult.
The priest seized this opportunity as soon as they were about to escape by grabbing Mira, then calling out his guard dogs leaving Zack and Johan greatly outnumbered. The reporter ran away from the scene leaving the three back into the camp. Johan and his friends were all locked inside dog cages forced to watch the sacrifice while the priest. Johan's mother (with her poor eyesight) regained her sanity after seeing Johan in the cage with her poor vision. The priest caught Johan's mother after she unlocked the cage commanding his disciples to use her as sacrifice for the dog gods.
Episode 136
The priest unlocked the cage Mira was inside and dragged her by the hair into the warehouse. The main worshipper took Zack and Johan out of the cages with their hands tied to watch the sacrifice up close. The disciples gathered around Johan's mother with stones and began chucking them at her, but before any rock landed on her, Johan directed the rocks away from his mother with quick jabs he learned from Zack.
Johan's hands were pouring out blood and it was revealed he got out of his handmade handcuffs by repeatedly grinding it against his skin peeling it in the process in order to slip out of them. Zack is not surprised by Johan's skill, because he was always jealous of Johan's boxing skill.
Episode 137
Johan rescued his mother from her being bound on the cross and went with Zack to save Mira. Cutaways ensued showing that the priest used hallucinogens to convince Johan's mother to convert herself away from Christianity. Johan and Zack fought their way towards Mira. However, the priest was guarded by his dogs and had a bucket of meat to coax his dogs. Since Johan and Zack were stuck at an impasse, they were hesitant. Mira then bit the priest in the leg buying enough time for Johan's mother to suddenly douse the priest in a concoction that lured his dogs to eating him alive.
The reporter from earlier called in the police and took over the case. Zack comforts Mira and Johan's mother was taken to a rehabilitation center leaving Johan alone once more. Afterwards he goes missing only to show up during the boxing completion that Zack was also participating in.
Episode 138
Johan rushes at Zack with speed and Zack dodges, stunning the crowd. Zack reveals he joined the competition so he can confess to Mira when he wins. However, he is beaten badly by Johan, who also decides to humiliate him by offering help after the match. Mira tries to catch up to Johan until she overhears him telling Gun that he has no friends. Hurt by this, she stops chasing him and Johan disappears with Eden.
Later, Mira smiles as Zack practices boxing. She initially disliked Zack because he changed into a bully after losing the boxing match, and he had no goals. Seeing Zack's return towards boxing made her happy again.
Cookie 1

"
God has chosen this place, the lowest of all places, through dogs. And I'm the Messiah.
"
—Cult Leader  in
episode 136
The
Cult Leader
is a minor character in
Lookism
.
Appearance
He is a middle aged man with combed black hair and a shaved stubble.
Personality
On the outside, the cult leader presents himself as a kind father-like figure to Johan and listens to other people's problems, acting as their savior.
In reality, he is a manipulative psychopath who has brainwashed and drugged multiple people, making them join his cult. He has absolutely no morals as he is not above scamming children and disabled people for his own gain, even taking enjoyment in these cruel acts. He feels no empathy for Johan, despite knowing his tragic reality, even smiling sadistically at manipulating his mother. He was also willing to cut off his hands and feet and locking him in his dog house. He is also very perverted, seeing as he stalked then later attempted to rape Mira, a middle schooler. When his rule is threatened, he reverts to a temper tantrum state, screaming that he is god. It is unknown if he genuinely believes he is god or is attempting to lie.
Furthermore, he is willing to fake a disability in order to get what he wants as shown when he becomes homeless and tries to get food.
He seemingly has an obsession with dogs, believing they are the key to godhood. He uses dogs to attack any unwanted intruders. He claims this is because they obey his every command when in actuality, he uses meat to control them
Relationships
Johan Seong
Johan looked up to the cult leader and would seek advice from him in a fatherly way. While the cult leader seemed to care for Johan, this was all a facade to hide his true nature from him as he would show no remorse in trying to kill him after manipulating him into his cult, which he tried to save his mom from.
Johan's mother
Like Johan, he seemed to be an ally to her. However, this was a facade to manipulate her into his cult. He shows no remorse over calling her a blind bitch and attacking her.
Mira Kim
He had a shameless pedophilic attraction to Mira with heavy implications he tried to rape her.
Synopsis
Backstory
The cult leader appears in Johan's backstory. He used to attend
Johan's
church but since then has started a cult, which he called the Church of Eden. Johan would often confide in him about his issues, and he agreed to accompany
Johan's mother
to his cult.
The cult leader used his charm to get people to join his church. He fed off their insecurities and promised them salvation if they listened to his every word, because he was their 'messiah'. He used drugs (which he likely brought from
Vivi
or her affiliates from
Workers 3rd Affiliate
) to make them susceptible to his influence. He trained his followers to worship dogs, which he controlled using scented liquids. If his followers disobeyed him they were either tortured or killed.
The cult leader tries to get Johan's mother to join his cult but she stopped when she realized her son was in danger. He attempted to stone her to death but Johan saved his mother. The cult leader also tried to rape
Mira
, but he was stopped by Johan's mother who instigated his dogs to attack him. The cult leader was eventually arrested and became homeless, making money using disability scams. Later, he got beat up and mugged by a group of
Hostel
thugs.
Fighting Prowess
He doesn’t seem to have any fighting skill, mainly relying on his dogs and cultists to do his dirty work.
Quotes
The meek shall inherit the Earth. God has chosen this place. The lowest of all places... through dogs.

Synopsis
Episode 75
Daniel
is posing for his part-time job as a fitting model. He runs into some male escorts arguing with their boss. The boss offers Daniel a job that will make use of his looks and he agrees to it
Daniel gets dressed up and appears to the workplace late at night. He mentions he is a minor and the man panics and tells him to pretend to be older. Daniel realizes he is working as an escort.
Episode 76
Daniel is disgusted by how the men view the women as sources of money. He is uncomfortable in the adult setting and tries to play cool but one of the women there, Jessy, falls for him. She tries to woo him with gifts but he refuses, because Jay already gave him a lot. He does ask for a rice cooker, and when he takes a drink to cool his nerves he gets drunk from the alcohol.
The other guys believe Daniel is trying to steal their customer and decides to discipline him. Daniel is inebriated, and becomes cocky in his drunkenness.
Episode 77
Daniel beats the escorts except their leader, who he tells to get a life. They are arrested for previous offenses and he leaves to go to school. The other students are shocked to see Daniel is drunk and running around with older women.
Episode 78
At the fashion department the other students are concerned about Daniel.
Jay
gives him hangover medicine which he doesn't take, and he tries to flirt with
Crystal
but she rejects him.
The Burn Knuckles
don't mention Daniel's drunkness and decide to stay away from him. A teacher discovers Daniel works at the escort place and orders him to stay after school.
Vasco
hears about Daniel's drunkness and decides to discipline him.
Episode 79
Vasco is shocked to see Daniel can still fight in his drunk state. Cho Ma, a fashion sophomore, steps in to stop the fight.
Jace
tells Vasco to leave Daniel alone and he tells Daniel to meet him later.
Eli
remembers seeing Daniel at his salon late that night and wonders what kind of person Daniel really is.
Daniel spots Crystal and corners her in an alley. He asks why she is avoiding him and almost collapses on her. Eli restrains him and asks what he is doing to Crystal. Daniel passes out and wakes up in his original body.
Episode 80
Daniel runs into Vasco while getting robbed on the way. He explains to Vasco the situation and he instantly believes him, saying Daniel does not tell lies. As Eli stares at Crystal she remembers how kind he has been towards her and wonders if he is attracted to her. She denies it because no one can be attracted to her fat body.
Daniel returns to the escort service to settle everything and meets the woman from before. She gives him the rice cooker he asked for but it is filled with money. He doesn't accept the money but is thankful. When he calls his mother he realizes he is ashamed of the work he did and lies about it. He goes back to working at the convenience store.
Cookie
Daniel thanks Jay for washing the suit he lent him. Jay did not actually wash the suit though; he just bought him a new one because he couldn't wash it, and let the dogs wear the older one.

Synopsis
Episode 172
As
Daniel
falls to the ground he has flashbacks to his memories in his second body. He wakes up in a cold sweat and races to find himself. As the ambulance takes him away he struggles to catch it but is not fast enough. He tries to smash his head in to wake up but only knocks himself out in the snow.
Jiho
is interrogated by the police and begins to panic. The detective mentions that if Daniel and
James
do not wake up he will have to wait for answers. Jiho begins to hope that Daniel and James don't wake up, and the detective notices the bruises on his face.
At the convenience store,
Zoe
waits for Daniel and wonders why he isn't there for the first snow.
Episode 173
Daniel is dreaming that he is back in school, and his second body is hanging out with his friends. His friends don't recognize his old self and leave him behind. As he pleads for them to come back his handsome body gives him a devilish smile. Daniel wakes up to find out he was dreaming, and not in his second body.
Daniel finds his body in the hospital comatose and the police struggle to identify him. They are worried about Daniel and believe James was the perpetrator of the incident. The detective interrogates Jiho about the pocket knife and he starts to panic.
The police call
Daniel's mother
and tell her about the incident. She gives Daniel a hug and a policeman is confused. He calls the detective to tell him there are two Daniels in J High.
Notes
In South Korea, there is a belief that confessing your love in the first snow of winter will grant the relationship longevity and good luck. That may be the reason Zoe is waiting for Daniel.

“
"Don't Worry, Zoe. You're finally...looking at me. Don't worry, it's all over."
”
— Daniel Park reassuring
Zoe Park
,
Ep. 198
Daniel Park
(박형석 Park Hyung-Seok)
is the main protagonist of
Lookism
. He grew up in a poor single-parent household and was bullied for being severely obese. Unable to endure the bullying any longer, he moved to central Seoul, where he suddenly found himself in a second handsome body. Capable of transferring his consciousness between two bodies, he begins living a double life—an ideal school life in his new body and a mundane existence as a convenience store clerk in his original one.
His Alternative Body would eventually lead him into the underworld of Seoul's Generations. Disturbed by the amount of unchecked injustice, Daniel would take it upon himself to fight back and stop their illegal activities. He would get into many gang fights all around Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the
Four Major Crews
,
1st Generation Kings
,
HNH Company
, and
Workers
.
Currently, he is a student at
J High School
's Fashion Department and the head of
Allied
—his current goal is to stop
James Lee
and
Kitae Kim
from starting another generation of war.
Appearance
Daniel has two bodies. His original body used to be short and overweight, now he's a lot more handsome, tall and muscular, and his second body is of tall height, thin and handsome and stated to be the perfect body.
First Body
In his original body, Daniel is usually bespectacled, and short to the point only
Duke Pyeon
and
Crystal Choi
's original body near his height. Daniel is extremely overweight, which is why Logan calls him "Pikachu" (Dog in the anime).
Daniel's first body is deemed unattractive by most, if not all, the exceptions being Crystal and Zoe. In this body, he's exposed to the true nature of society. Daniel uses this body at night to work part-time at a local mini mart, which is why it's usually seen in his work uniform.
Despite the difference in weight and height, his first body gradually begins to resemble his second. After his fight with
Logan Lee
and the incident involving the homeless man who broke his glasses, Daniel's face is more striking, and he's noticeably taller and slimmer, measuring up slightly taller than
Zoe
in height. After intense dieting and training with Sophia, he loses over a hundred pounds, so his original body is practically identical to his second body, though it is shorter. After Gun's training, Daniel has grown very tall; nearing his second body in height. Daniel has also put on more muscle mass, making him look more defined, he looks really similar to his second body in chapter (424). His face looks quite identical to the second body as well. It was stated that he resembles a younger Jinyoung Park, and even his grandmother confused him as Jinyoung Park.
Second Body
Daniel Park first see's his second body
In his second body, Daniel has no glasses and he's taller. He has a healthy, athletic build and more physically attractive. This being his most notable trait, usually leaving women infatuated and men intimidated. Daniel's good looks make people think he is a famous model, idol, or star (which he eventually becomes) as they go so far as to ask for his autographs and pictures with him, much to his shock.
No one has ever been stated to surpass Daniel's good looks, and no one retains the center of attention as he does (albeit unintentionally), as a result, his second body is the most popular student at J High. He uses this body to attend school and it's usually seen in his school uniform, unless elsewhere.
Personality
Daniel is a very kind and friendly person at heart, preferring to avoid unnecessary conflicts if he can, but will help those in need even in dangerous situations.
Initially, due to being bullied, Daniel would take out his anger on his mom. However, he began to realize just how much she sacrificed for his sake, filling him with deep feelings of self-loathing and regret for his actions towards his mother to the point of vowing to be a better person. He often cries whenever he is reminded of how he treated her, such as when in his second body, he was asked to act out a certain role as a test to see his acting skills only for Daniel to cry while reading the script as the part was similar to a part of his life, he regretted the most. So as to not trouble his mother financially, Daniel is very humble and responsible as he does not bother with materialistic things unless they cut down on his or his mom's living expenses (e.g., rice cooker) and is willing to work so he can pay his own living expenses.
Daniel is also very sympathetic and protective of those mistreated, either because of their lack of strength or because of how unattractive they are, as he can relate to how both feel and is prone to stand up for them. Though it is implied in the Runaway fam arc he is respectful enough to not interfere in other affairs without permission.
Lack of self-confidence is often Daniel's biggest hindrance slowing his progress on his goal of trying to be a better person. In some cases, it leads to his being perceived as a pushover who is nothing but a coward. Fortunately, Daniel is constantly inspired by those who diligently work towards their goals, such as Euntae and Duke and is motivated to put more effort into overcoming his struggles to achieve his goals.
Due to his lack of social interaction with people around him prior to having his second body, he can be naive, much like Euntae, and is unsure how to act when placed under peer pressure. Likewise, he is easily deceived by perceived kindness. For example, he once accidentally agreed to become a host in a club and escaped the club while drunk. Moreover, he thought that Yui genuinely liked him for who he is while in his second body but was shocked when she treated him cruelly while he was in his original body. He also never smoked or intentionally drank before and didn't know how to refuse when putting under pressure to do so. However, this tends to create humorous situations and misunderstandings about him.
After temporarily losing his connection with his current body and being helplessly bullied by Logan Daniel regressed back into his old self before moving to Seoul. But after realizing that this world wasn't fair and how he needs to work harder to overcome that unfairness Daniel gets a way better appreciation for his old body and becomes more confident in it.
Daniel tends to become belligerent, overconfident, and apologetic when drunk.

In later arcs he is seen to also have an aggressive personality when in a tense battle.
History
Daniel was raised by a single mom, and they lived in poverty. In addition to his poor living conditions, Daniel was looked down upon due to his appearance, leading him to be bullied at school (mostly by Logan). No longer willing to put up with the bullying, Daniel's mother offered him a chance to transfer to a different school (Jae Won High). Daniel, unable to bear with his school troubles any longer, tearfully accepted.
Upon moving, Daniel's dreams of starting anew were quickly shattered by a humiliating defeat at the hands of
Zack Lee
, captured on video. With the video going viral, he cried himself to sleep only to awaken the next morning in a completely new body. He discovered the following rules:
He has to sleep to change bodies
If one body is forcefully awakened, the other body will go to sleep.
The sleeping body has to be cared for like an actual body.
He is conscious at all times (cannot have dreams).
In a state of lost consciousness, he cannot change bodies until the other body recovers consciousness.
The sleeping body experiences all physiological phenomena normal bodies do.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Copy Technique
Seoul, the land where monsters fight- he commands those monsters, a genius no one can defy. He is someone who rose from the bottom- the head of Allied.
Daniel is actually a natural-born fighter despite his lack of confidence and any formal training prior. Regardless of which body he is in, Daniel can memorize any technique down to its textbook mechanics after seeing it once and execute it with the same amount of competency as a skilled expert. In addition to this skill, he possesses incredible foresight in a fight, able to clearly see all attacks his opponents throw at him. Whether or not he is able to dodge the said attacks usually depends on his opponent and Daniel's current body. Daniels' ability to copy other people's techniques is so amazing that to others who fought Daniel felt like they were fighting themselves. Later on it was stated that Daniel’s ability to copy others Techniques were far superior to Johan Seong(Another copy cat genius) stating that Johan only imitates others while Daniel is the real deal (which correlates with him being as competent as a Skilled master in that martial art or field) In the more recent chapters whenever he copies a character his hair or physical appearance turns similar to them.Further his fighting senses were so accute that he was able to catch Gun (while in trainning) and DJ offguard while fighting them which proved his calm and levelheaded attitude even in strenuous situations. According to Gun, Daniel has the eyes to figure out his out his opponent, but he isnt able to use it to its full strength. If he focuses, he can see more. During Busan arc his copy ability in second body further developed and he could copy others move effortlessly but during his fight with Jinrang when he copied the moves of his opponent along with the techniques and moves of other kings he could copy them easily but couldn't genrate the same power .Jinrang mentioned that he could copy the moves but he could never copy the intents or its force due to not understanding its significance and hardwork required to develop them thus the power of those techniques were weak.
Original Body
Daniel's old body
While not on par with his second body, his weight does add an incredible amount momentum to his attacks unleashing them with such surprising force that he even forced Euntae (who possesses unbelievable strength) to resort to knocking him out when he felt he could no longer withstand his punches. He rarely ever fights in this body due to his lack of confidence while using it, but as the series progresses, he does become a more capable fighter, especially under
Vasco
's strict workouts and guidance despite him not being aware of it. In this body, he severely lacks the desired reflexes he gains in his second body. Despite being able to see the attacks (even once commented on how slow they were), he was still not able to physically dodge them due to this body's lack of agility and reflexes. It should be noted that if attacks are executed by non-skilled practitioners, even in this body, he has no problems defending against them. Despite its many shortcomings Daniel's first body still has impressive strength and endurance as he managed to take and multiple hits from Logan Lee and recover from the experience with no lasting injuries. even
chairman hong
was surprised that daniel took an attack from
sophia
and survived while most can not. With enough determination, his fat body could take out a person with little or no fighting experience.
Daniel trained his body becoming unrecognizable to most people in this new form looking closer to his second body than his first, even
Zoe Park
and
Logan Lee
did not recognize him as the transformation was extreme. The weaknesses his body had are now gone as his body is faster with the addition of Systema. he has high tolerance to drugs that the drugs that were in the cookies were ineffective. Later on, he is trained by Gun as a potential successor, making him a far more fearsome fighter, he is shown to easily beat a Workers Executive and even throw Xiaolung, who is known for being a powerful opponent to many. He is also seen countering Yuseong's attack by blocking his fist and using the other leg to kick him into the ground. He has gotten so strong to the point where Eugene even compares him to a First Generation King.
Original body after training (Episode 411)
In chapter 438, he was able to use "
Self-Hatred
" mode in his Original Body just like his Second Body.
In chapter 439, Daniel was barely able to copy the moves of James Lee, but he was not as fast as him. Jichang praised his strength and said he understood why seokdu lost and why taesoo got fired up. This may imply Daniel was on the level of Taesoo or Seokdu.
In Chapter 439, Gun Taught him about Subconsciousness by choking Daniel on the neck and gains an ability to use
Ultra Instinct
again just like his Second Body.
In the current arc as of chapter 453 it is known that he can take on someone on the level of Jichang Kwak (being superior to the same only when using the Ultra Instinct), who himself is stated that brute strength wise is on par with Gun Park (stated by Daniel Park himself), and Jichang Kwak was someone that even Elite (Charles Choi) was interested in becoming his bodyguard before he took Jichang's life.
It is also shown in the recent chapter that Gun mentioned that Daniel's copy ability was inefficent in his old body  earlier as he could not generate the same power while executing the techniques that he copied, but after his training with Gun his body became strong to such level that Gun mentioned that he could now easily imitate all the moves of Gen 1 Kings almost perfecly (including
Taesoo Ma's Fist techniques
).
In the recent chapter he copied
Kwak Jinchang's
Hand Edge Technique
perfectly while fighting Logan Lee and pulverised him thus defeating him easily.
When he used Ultra Instinct against his second body, it was stated that he and his second body was moving so fast that not even Warren could keep up. If Vasco, Warren and Jerry steped in the fight, they would die. He and his second body were using every fighting technique under they experienced so far, and given that they had the same movements and techniques, they could be mistaken as the same person. However, little Daniel was being pushed back due to the experience gap between the two bodies.
According to Gun Park, His ultra instinct (along with his second body) is fundamentally different from his. With Ultra instinct, he fights efficiently by adjusting to his opponent's combat power. He is mechanical with his counterattacks by returning an attack equal to the one he received. However, he does not have control over it. Due to that , when receiving the same attack the second time, he will give the same response each time.Futher in comparison to his perfect body he was inefficient in perfecting the power of the used  techniques
Gun Park mentioned that Daniel Park was his greatest masterpiece he ever created .
Second Body
Second body in UI mode
In this body, Daniel is among the strongest in the entire series. Even before he developed his technique and skill, he was able to defeat most opponents, solely relying on reflexes and instinct and is one of the few characters to naturally be on the level of skilled fighters with no prior formal training, the other being Johan. This, coupled with Daniel's ability to instantly replicate any fighting skill he sees just once, makes him one of the series' most formidable fighters by outdoing many others with their own fighting techniques.
It seems Daniel has become used to his abilities and immense fighting prowess in this body, able to dodge attacks merely on reflex with extreme ease, even while in deep thought. In some fights, he has found some attacks to be annoying.
His biggest testament to his fighting prowess is being one of the only people (the other being Euntae) that Jong Gun, a fighter of legendary status, acknowledges even once. Gun stated that, although Crystal was heading for a dangerous situation, if she is accompanied by Daniel and Euntae, then she's not in any real danger. However, he is not yet on the level of Jong Gun or Joon Goo, as he was easily defeated by Gun but in his UI state he fought a contolled UI Gun Park on equal footing in his hideout. Meanwhile, Euntae, his fighting equal, was soundly defeated by Jake Kim, who Gun promptly defeated.
So far Daniel's biggest weakness is that his compassion can often lead to unfair or synchronized fighters like Chuck Kwak and Justin Peng to overwhelm him. He also can't copy the determination that comes from the moves he copies, which makes opponents like Zack hard to fight.
Daniel's last trick is when he enters a state known as "Ultra-Instinct," in which he is rendered in a state between conscious and unconscious. He is able to maximize his fighting potential by utilizing every single move of his knowledge without hesitation. In this state he is so powerful that he is able to suppress Jerry Kwon and even able to break one of Gun's arms in their one-on-one fight. He was able to defeat 2 Crew Head (Jake Kim and Samuel Seo) simultaneously. He then proceeded to easily defeat Jerry Kwon and Lineman. After that, he completely dominated a raged Johan Seong in their fight. Although, he was not able to defeat Goo because he suddenly passed out, he still inflicted a huge damage on him. The downside of this state is that he is unable to control himself, making it difficult to discern between friends and foes.
In chapter 467, Gun has stated that Ultra Instinct was able to control (Gun Park can control UI) and the one who can control it can "adjust" their strength whatever they want. The one who aren't able to control UI will "adjust" their strength based on the opponents. For example, if the opponent is weak, UI will adjust its strength being weak for that opponent. If the opponent is strong, UI will just adjust its strength being strong for that opponent.
While he and his real body had the same techniques and movements, Warren states that Big Daniel had more experience using those techniques. Its as if he has more practiced and that little daniel was simply copying him.
In chapter 470
Jinyoung Park
said that Daniels strength is on the level of the ones whom the
Gapryong fist
was fighting against and he is way past the level of the 2nd and 1st generation and also said the he wanted to see Daniel and Gapryong in a fight this implies that he is around the level of
Gapryong Kim.
According to DG, Daniel and Gun share ultra instinct, but their fighting styles are different (possibly due to having different bloodlines). With Ultra instinct, he is more like a cool-headed machine. He uses sophisticated techniques to maximize his efficiency like a perfect weapon.which was a flaw as even an injured Gun Park defeated him in his Ulta Instincrt staye mentioning that until he controls it he couldn't kill Gun Park.
Druing his fight with Jangyeon Na he fought with a higher intensity owing to his training with Shiro Oni, he used  his Heat mode and Yamazaki Kyokushin Karate to overpowering King of Incheon shocking him and other spectators equally.

Jinyoung Park
(Maternal Uncle)
Jinyoung Park is the only one apart from Charles Choi and James Lee to know about Daniel's two bodies. In chapter 439 and 440 ,
Bakgu Noh
calls Daniel as young master and tells him that he looks exactly like Jinyoung Park when he was young and tells
Jichang Kwak
not to put ' his' blood line in jeopardy. With this we know that he is related to jinyoung park in a way.After the cheonling arc we find out that Jinyoung Park is actually Daniel's Mother's younger brother.
Daniel's Old School:
Hyeji
Hyeji's boyfriend
Logan Lee
Mae Kim
J High School:
Crystal Choi
Crystal liked the original Daniel, despite them seeming to despise each other mutually whenever they met in their new body, both having slight prejudice against people with an attractive exterior. However, as the plot progressed, the negative feelings between the two seemed to subside, especially during the Stalker Arc. She won the auction for a date with him in her second body, yet she never went on a date with him. Crystal has shown to be suspicious of Daniel's second body and attempts to investigate, but has not found any concrete evidence.
However as the plot progressed, despite Crystal's original body appearences was reduced,  it is left ambiguous if Daniel has abandoned any feelings for the original Crystal.
Doo Lee
Duke Pyeon
Daniel respects Duke for his commitment to music despite receiving a lot of hardship for his appearance. Duke reminds Daniel of what he could be if he tries harder. He is the one who helped Duke get into PTJ and supports him by watching him and appearing as a guest on his channel from time to time.
Eli Jang
Gordon Park
Han Park
Jay Hong
Jay is Daniel's best friend. The two are refered to and shown to be very close multiple times throughout the episodes, as Jay appears to be deeply caring for Daniel's wellness. Indeed, Jay is often shown doing nice things for Daniel, without him realizing it most of the time (buying him thousand of dollars worth of clothes, giving Daniel very expensive schoolbooks for him to study with, involving himself in fights for Daniel even though Jay hates fighting, etc). Jay even has pictures of Daniel on his phone and wallet, and becomes quite panicked if he looses them. Their bond is also demonstrated through the fact that Daniel is one of the only persons who can understand him, as Jay is only ever seen in the webtoon speaking in dots.

Vasco is one of Daniel's inspirations to begin working out in his old body. He admires the dedication Vasco has in improving himself and the loyalty that the Burn Knuckles have towards him. Vasco is one of the first people in the story to call Daniel a friend, and encourages Daniel to constantly improve himself.
Vin Jin

Zoe Park
When Daniel transferred to J High School, she immediately started flirting with him. In fact, she was the first girl to have ever flirted with him. Although Zoe at first didn't respect Daniel in his original body, she began falling in love with the original Daniel after he saved her from an internet stalker, which seemed to confuse her because she still has a crush on the new Daniel.

When Daniel second body was caught by the workers Daniel came to Gun asking to be taught how to fight and become stronger. Gun takes him and trains him in a junkyard for a month and Gun calls him his masterpiece.

Synopsis
Daniel Park used to be bullied a lot by Logan Lee.
[
1
]
When his mother witnessed his bullying, he decided to transfer schools to escape Logan. He moved to a new house and got into a fight with Zack Lee in his old body. He cried himself to sleep, but when he woke up he saw he had a new body, which was handsome and strong.
[
2
]
Daniel decided to go to school in his new body and work at a convenience store in his old one. He quickly gained popularity for his looks, and boys became jealous of him. He beat both Zack and Vasco in a fight, and became enemies with the Burn Knuckles before Vasco changed his mind about him. Zack used to bully him as well, until he learned about Daniel's struggles. During his time in school he made friends with Zoe, Jiho, Duke, and Jay, who became his best friend.
A few months in school there was a transfer student named Crystal Choi, who many people thought was unattractive. Daniel fell in love with her, and she fell in love with his actual body. However, neither of them knew that they both had two bodies. When Crystal and Daniel met for a second time, they resented each other because each thought the other was arrogant. They took turns taking care of the lost dog Enu before Daniel adopted her and gave her puppies to Jay.
DG became interested in Daniel when he heard about him from Gun. He told Daniel that he could tell him the secret of his bodies if he united the four crews. Daniel came across Johan Seong, the leader of the God Dogs, and they became friends. When Jiho got scammed by the God Dogs, Daniel offered to help get his bank account back. He even helped save Jiho from James Gong, but Jiho became jealous of Daniel and pushed the two of them out of a window, making Daniel's second body enter a coma.
While trying to learn about his secret, he ran into Crystal's father, who told him he had to surpass DG to learn about his secret. Logan Lee had also began bullying Daniel in his old body, and forcing him to woo Zoe for him. Daniel became overwhelmed and decided to run away and become homeless for some time. He eventually returned to find out Logan was sexually harassing Zoe. He fought Logan in his old body, and was able to get his second body back.
Daniel returned to school and met up with Johan, who offered him a position in the God Dogs. He refused, and made a promise to destroy all four gangs. He later became interested in Hostel when he learned they were using pictures of girls to sell perverted items. He infiltrated Hostel and managed to save some girls from prostitution scams. While Jace and Johan were busy fighting Hostel, Daniel and his friends went on a trip to Cheongliang and met up with members of Vin's old gang who wanted revenge on him.
Daniel returned to school when he learned Jasmine was missing again. He found her after Zack, who told him he could not take her home. When Zack refused to tell him why, Daniel assumed he was being unreasonable and decided to fight him.

Zoe

Logan
, which surprises everyone at
J high.

asks Zoe to come with her if she is scared and Logan threatens to beat her.
Zack
challenges Logan to a fight but Zoe drags Logan away, causing Zack to become concerned. Other students begin spreading rumors about Zoe being a slut. At night
Crystal
witnesses Zoe being forced to kiss Logan in an alleyway.
Daniel
returns to his mother. He is upset to find out Zoe didn't message him, and even more upset when he finds out she dated Logan, knowing he is a terrible person who hurt him. Crystal stops by Daniel's house and slaps him. She tells him Zoe is being forced to date Logan, and she overheard it in the alleyway. Elsewhere, Zoe cries in a shower about her situation. Later, Daniel confronts Logan in an alleyway.
Episode 196

Episode 197
Daniel begins copying Zack and
Vasco's
moves but he is overwhelmed by Logan. Despite his weaker physique he continues to fight until Logan hits him with his right hand. He passes out.
Daniel is in the convenience store when he sees all his old friends. His second body comes in and walks away with them, and he is sad to be left behind. Then he sees his old body come to him and ask why he can't approach his friends first. He races to catch them and thanks his old self, but it has disappeared. He smiles and realizes he had to leave his old self behind before he could change into his better self. With this, he wakes up in his second body.
Episode 198
Daniel
gets up from the hospital and races to find his body. He finds
Logan
still beating the crap out of his unconscious self and stops him, calling Logan pathetic. Logan stands up but feels disoriented from Daniel's beating. As Daniel carries himself he is proud of the way he fought in his real body.
Back at the hospital Daniel's nurse is worried about him, but he tells her he will be alright. His original body is resting in a different bed. The nurse mentions a friend who lived in the hospital to take care of him, and Daniel spots
Jay
in the hallway. He was reading medical books to figure out how to help Daniel wake up. Daniel thanks Jay and he cries tears of joy.

Synopsis
Episode 285
Gun
tells
Daniel
to stop investigating about James Lee, or he will make an enemy of the chairman. He agrees to tell Daniel about James Lee if he is willing to start a crew, even going so far as to threaten his friends to work under him. He offers him money and power, but Daniel refuses and Gun decides to kill him. As Gun is choking Daniel, he becomes unconscious, allowing Daniel to tap into UI for the 2nd time and begins fighting Gun. He overwhelms him until he wakes up suddenly, and was revealed to be winning against Gun.
Episode 286
Gun is impressed that Daniel managed to break his arm, and gives him a card with the words "ONE MCN", saying it is a clue to overwhelm the four crews. Meanwhile,
Charles Choi
and
Steve Hong
are out hunting after accepting his offer. Hong asks Choi about gangs of minors he has heard, and he thinks they are being exploited by a businessman. Choi shoots close to Hong, claiming he saw a raccoon. Hong does the same, and calls out
Goo Kim
from behind the tree where he was hiding.
In Gangnam,
Hostel B
are waiting outside the ONE MCN building. The girls are interviewing for an online streaming position at the company, and
Warren
is cleaning the place to appear presentable. They wait near the entrance as
Samuel Seo
and his entourage appear.

Darius Hong (홍두표
Hong Du-Pyo
)
is the leader of Gangdong's Back-Door Gang.
Appearance
Darius is a tall man, as he is visibly much taller than
Eli
when standing in front of him. Darius has a muscular structure, with well-built legs that are thin in comparison to his broad shoulders and large biceps. On his left arm is a sleeve of tattoos, some colored. He has rather messy, black hair with the sides cut short, and prominent sideburns. He is normally seen with a smirk or disturbed expression.
In
Juvenile Prison Arc
, he wears the prison uniform with a yellow name tag. Outside of juvenile prison, he wears a black sleeveless shirt, blue pants, painted nails, and a necklace with a bow.
Personality
He is somewhat flirtatious in nature, and is rather feminine since he has a bow chain necklace and blue nails and because he tends to sugarcoat words in ways to make his words seem innocent when fighting, such as calling people “sugar cake” and “strawberry cake”.
Relationships
TBA
Synopsis
Juvenile Prison Arc
He meets Jiho in the prison cell, and they are the only ones who have yellow tags standing for violent crimes. Jiho threatens him, by Darius is not amused. Darius makes Jiho's life miserable, by forcing him to clean the toilet, sleep in the coldest spot, and beating him up.

In the lunchroom, Darius tries to start a fight, until he realizes that he picked a fight with Jake Kim. He then apologizes. He lets Jake stomp his head on the ground without putting up any resistance. The guards come in and stop the fight, asking who did it, and Darius insists that he fell on the ground and that Jake wasn't involved. When leaving, Darius glares at Jiho, threatening his death.
In the bath, Jiho sneaks up behind Darius, determined to live.

His own fear was later used against him similar with Eli with Jiho grabbed ahold of his towel and wrapped his neck around it. He was then defeated once he saw Jiho's face of someone who wanted to murder him. It is then likely that he became scared of Jiho similar with the other prisoners.

Eli

The
Dark Society Faction
formerly called the
Dark Crocodile Society
is a powerful faction that has ruled Incheon in the shadows since the
0th Generation
era, originating from China with its members immigrating to Korea, with their base being Incheon's Chinatown where they expel Korean citizens for the Chinese to populate, currently led by
Yujae Seon
, one of the two Kings of Incheon.
Organization
Crew Strength
Fighting Capabilities
In addition to Yujae's power that rivals that of the other kings of the
1st Generation
, the faction has a thousand highly capable subordinates as well as powerful captains who command their troops in their civil war against Jaegyeon Na's rival faction for possession of the Incheon territory. The organization is so powerful and influential that it attracted the interest of both
Jake Kim
and
Gitae Kim
to form an alliance, both of whom prioritized recruiting them over their
Speed Faction
.
Weaknesses
Specialization and Professions
Unlike the rival faction, they operate Incheon's underworld in a much more organized manner and across various sectors of the economy, with their large number of members they maintain shadow control of Incheon's main businesses, establishing their base in Chinatown.

“
I, Gapryong Kim's disciple, am the sole King. Someone like me can't be fighting these nobodies.
”
— Dayoung Oh,
Episode 550
Dayoung Oh (오다영 Oh Dal Yeong)
was a minor antagonist in Lookism, he was the former King of Busan.
Appearance
Dayoung has pink hair, with a slightly prominent mouth and cheekbones.
In his youth, Dayoung had a messy bowl cut and wore jeans, sneakers, and a simple white shirt with a green vest. His appearance was that of someone who was humble or concerned.
After years, Dayoung changed completely, having a short haircut, with his hair pulled back and shaved at the corners. His attire also changed, wearing a dark gray suit, a tie with an animal-spot pattern, and a fur cloak. He is also often wearing a pair of expensive-framed glasses.
Personality
According to people in Busan, Dayoung was a helpful person with a "romantic fist." So much so that he caught the attention of
Gapryong Kim
, who made him his disciple.
However,
Jongnam Hwang
and
Yongpal Bae
began to manipulate him, and Dayoung gradually changed, to everyone's surprise, perhaps revealing his true repressed side. Thus, Dayoung Oh is vain, selfish, a liar, sadistic, and violently arrogant to everyone except Jongnam Hwang and Yongpal Bae, obeying them in most of their requests and suggestions, calling them "godfather".
Dayoung also seems to have a hollow pride, and he always needs to mention Gapryong Kim in any argument as an excuse to do whatever he wants.
Relationships
Gapryong Kim
Dayoung deeply respects Gapryong, even though he currently does absolutely nothing that made him worthy of being his disciple in the past.
Jongnam Hwang
and
Yongpal Bae
Since they were the ones who brought Dayoung's evil side to light, he respects and obeys them, having a nephew and godfather relationship.
Jinrang
,
Sang Baek
and
Jungseok Hwang
For a time, the three were bodyguards and Dayoung's people, who always abused them, using them as if they were dolls or objects to pass the time.
Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
As a disciple of Gapryong, Dayoung is familiar with his fighting style, and uses it sparingly. He is arguably stronger than many members of the 0th Generation, but he still lacks much focus and attention, as Dayoung is always arrogantly carefree and with his guard down.

Warren Chae
TBA
Synopsis
History
Max and Derrick grew up in the same orphanage as Warren. Derrick was left abandoned as a baby on the back seat of a express bus.  Ten years later they met
Warren Chae
as he entered.
The three of them went to the same middle school and gained a reputation for their fighting skills. When Sally Park allowed Warren to stay in her home, they followed him.
The two of them are known for their fighting skills. Gun compared them to Johan Seong in terms of skill. Even Warren could never beat Max and Derrick together, although alone they are not that much. They got matching tattoos in Hostel, unlike the other members, to signify their strong bond.
When Eli Jang left Hostel, Max and Derrick left to earn money to support them. They returned in episode 278, called by Sally Park, to fight Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak, defeating the duo. Ever since, Max and Derrick have remained with Hostel.
Fighting Prowess
While not very powerful on their own Max and Derrick were described as Warren to be a 10/10 in terms of fighting capability. Their main strength is their ability to fight as one while supporting others through combo moves. They are so skilled in fact that they defeated Gangdog's, Mighty Warren Chae and were described by Gun as being equal to Johan Seong. It also could be said that they're equal to Hostel A's Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak given Olly's need to create his own Hostel.

"I would love to stop making enemies, but once again I've ended up with even more of them."
”
— DG, Episode 427
DG
(
Diego Kang
; 강다겸
Kang Dagyum
)
is a famous Korean idol and also the head of
PTJ Entertainment
, an idol training agency. He is one of Charles Choi's Ten Geniuses and has close ties with him. He used to be known as
James Lee
but discarded this identity. He is known as the legend of the 1st generation. During the
1st Generation
, Charles Choi used
DG
to murder
Gapryong Kim
. This incident was completely hidden, according to
Eugene
, it was the incident with the murder of
Baekho Kwon
and
Gapryong Kim
that was Charles' weakness. He’s one of the few people who knows about Daniel Park having two bodies.
Appearance
DG is a physically striking individual with a slim physique and pale skin. He is known for his distinctive pink hair and dark eyes. He often wears dark sunglasses and has a tattoo on his forearm.
When assuming the identity of James Lee, DG adopts a starkly different appearance. He wears an all-white outfit, including a woolen sweatshirt, and covers his face with a mask.
Personality
DG is more cool and composed than most, if not all, characters in Lookism. He tends to watch and observe others silently, but when he talks, he acts quite aloof and distant, only warming up to a few people. DG is also very honest, but he doesn't talk much so it's sometimes difficult to know what he is thinking.
He is known to be extremely intelligent and talented. A hall of his trophies and awards were displayed in his previous school which is now abandoned, showing his expertise in various fields. Some of the awards includes him being a champion in art, poetry, golf, swimming, tennis, and many more.
Back in the 1st generation, James was extremely ruthless. He made sure to leave a mark or reminder to each of the Kings by either incising or removing a part of their body, like
Taesoo Ma
's eye.
Fighting Prowess
As the legend of the first generation, DG is immensely powerful and is one of the strongest fighters in the PTJ verse. Sometimes it is said he is the strongest in the verse. He single handedly took down Darius Hong and his gang with ease, showing prodigal skill in combat. It is said that he ended the
first generation
, a notorious era of well known fighters. He bested Taesoo Ma, the "King Of Ansan" in a fight with little to no injuries. He fights using an acrobatic style , and being incredibly quick and swift, to dodge other's attacks. His fighting style is described to be very graceful. He is also one of three users able to use
Invisible Attacks
, where one attacks the blindspots of an opponent so quickly, the attack seems invisible to the eye.
In chapter 428, he fought the J High trio and says that he will spare Big Deal and Burn Knuckles if they manage to land a single clean hit on him. Over the course of the fight, he overpowered the trio with little to no effort while keeping his left hand in his pocket.
In the past, James had managed to defeat and disband the
Generation of Circles
(1st Gen) all by himself, and take a body part of the regional kings he had defeated, such as Taesoo's eye and Gongseob Ji's leg (with some
exceptions
).
As of chapter 463 it is shown that in the past during his fight with Gongseob Ji, James was shown an incredible technique by Gongseob called the 'Gongseob Ji Counter' where it is described to be a double edge sword as you need to have an immense desire to not fall and to win to get back up to land a devastating punch on your opponent that could potentially end the fight with your win, but it was shown that either James dodged the attack or took it head on and received no damage whatsoever. Even James wanted to learn the technique but Gongseob declined and stated he would never take on a student (which
changed
) and made the stone faced sarcastic James Lee lament and sigh stating that its sad that Gongseob will have to retire and that the technique will fall with him.
In his fight with
Seongji Yuk
, he reveals that he has "overcome the threshold" in two areas, speed and technique, those two alone allowing him to be as legendary as he was. He also states that he isn't able to overcome another threshold because he's lacking in potential.In the later part of the battle he was able to overcome the threshold of strength against Seongji Yuk.
Quotes
I would love to stop making enemies, but once again I've ended up with even more of them.

Etymology
The name
Shion
is written in hiragana (しおん), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (紫苑 or 詩音), it could possibly mean:
紫苑 - "
aster
", a plant of the daisy family that has bright rayed flowers, typically of purple or pink.
詩音 - "poetry, poem" (詩) (
shi
) and "sound" (音) (
on
).
Shion's surname
Izaki
means "that one" (伊) (
i
) and "cape, peninsula" (崎) (
saki
/
zaki
).
Trivia
DG's design and name are references to
G-Dragon
, a real-life Kpop rapper.
Based on the trophies previously showcased at his old school, DG excels in a variety of domains besides fighting such as art, poetry, swimming, golf and tennis.
[
3
]
DG's school's name has been shown in Episode 176 but its full name was revealed in Episode 396.
[
4
]
DG first appeared in episode 19 in a poster on student's Namsoo Lee's Wall.
He has an angel motif, established by his all white clothing and graceful fighting style. This contrasts with Gun Park who has a demon motif.
In Episode 479, people started to believe that DG is actually Charles's second body. This speculation however has been invalid as in Episode 480, DG said he had followed Charles's action on "kidnapping" Baek Gyul because Charles was scared that Gyul could ask Park Jin Young about his weakness.

Background
Every parent's dream
James Lee abandoned apartment
DG was previously known as James Lee, the Legend of the First Generation who put a violent end to the first generation via a swift and (presumably) individual defeat of all of his contemporaries. He disappeared after accomplishing his goal, but soon reappeared in Seoul as one of Charles Choi's
ten geniuses
taking part in the creation of the
four major crews
. His exploits and power were so great that he became a target, leading to him assuming a new identity as DG the pop star. Thus he changed his name, attitude and the way of talking as he accomplished his goal.

James Lee's father's market
DG was placed as a trainee after
Oliver
, quickly becoming world famous due to his skills and appearance. DG became a very famous singer and the head of PTJ Entertainment.

]
James Lee's school uniform
While investigating his second body, Daniel discovered several clues about DG's previous life as James Lee. Daniel discovers a file containing a clue about his second body: it is called James Lee. The file gives information about James Lee's address, that he lives alone and his parents live overseas. He visits the address on the file and finds it is empty and abandoned except for James Lee's jacket. The jacket leads him to a school with many awards and trophies addressed to James Lee. He finds a photo of a market with a family, and an old man there says that a boy and his father used to live there five years ago.

Plot
Pavlov's Dog
DG asks Crystal during a meeting if he can go visit Daniel since he is curious about him, and the president is also keeping an eye on Daniel.
PTJ Entertainment
DG
observes Daniel's skills and grows suspicious of him. At the agency Daniel meets DG, who is disappointed at Daniel for working in a convenience store. Daniel tries to get him to explain but he walks away. DG invites Crystal to a meeting with the executives of PTJ Entertainment, making Aru jealous.
DG,
Gun
and Crystal discuss Aru's departure and DG tells them about the photoshoot Aru is scheduled to do. Crystal asks why DG is not doing anything, and he reassures her that he has a plan. DG informs them in front of the director that he used his shares to vote in remove the director from his position as CEO of the company, and replace him with Charles Choi. He bought more shares during the drop in price as well, and added those to his previous shares.
At the end of the incident DG tells Daniel that he has no reason to talk to him now, and he will approach him when the time is right.
Stalker
Crystal congratulates DG on his position as the new CEO of PTJ Entertainment. He tells her he more happy that his stalker has stopped harassing him, a woman he was terrified of for a very long time.
Jake Kim
Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.
Later James Lee meets with Goo Charles Choi, Tom Lee, Eugene to discuss starting the four major crews. Goo asks what James Lee is planning on the side with Charles Choi, since he is busy with Eugene creating the four crews. James Lee simply greets him.
Workers (3 Affiliates)
DG shows up in front of Daniel and asks why he has Vivi's cookies.
An Invitation From the Dead
DG
confiscates the cookies from
Daniel
and is too fast for him to take them back. He pats Daniel down and recognizes that he is Daniel Park. Daniel is surprised because he hasn't met him in the little body. DG asks Daniel if his secret move was taught by
Sophia Alexander
. DG eventually decides to give the cookies back to Daniel because he intends to meet
Steve Hong
himself. He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know.
James Lee
Eugene
tells Daniel the story of James Lee and the
History of Fists
. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.
Daniel asks DG if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee. Daniel asks how DG knows about the two bodies, and DG tells him that he's known about Daniel's bodies since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.
DG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by
Gapryong Kim
, who was known as the "Legendary Fist". The crews at this time were called "fists", and the crew heads were called "bosses", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called "circles". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of
Charles Choi's
geniuses
, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.
Eugene later calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.
One Night III
DG goes off to find the James Lee crew and put an end to their misuse of his name. He comes to their headquarters and finds Backdoor members. He asks if they know about James Lee, and they decide to attack him and bring him to Darius. DG beats them all and walks away.
DG then comes across Daniel and the J High crew fighting Taesoo Ma and interrupts them.

Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
The King of Pyeongtaek trained his fists, this can be seen by looking at the scars he had on his fist, and his strongest attack is his punch that comes from below. As for his level, he would scale similar to the King of Suwon, since defeating Seokdu required the combined effort of pre-mastery Eli and Samuel(Warren didn't do much) while the King of Pyeongtaek was defeated by the duo of Eli and pre-mastery Warren.

—Doo Lee  in
episode
331
Doo Lee
(이현도 Lee Hyun-do)
is a student in the fashion department at
J High School
, and a former Executive of
Workers
2nd Affiliate group under the alias "Hannya".
Appearance
He has a skinny, lanky body and a long cleft chin. His black hair is pointed up at his bangs. He has exaggerated expressions at times.
Personality
He is a bully, and his most notable victim is Jiho. He also thinks highly of himself. He is usually accompanied by his two friends, Han Park & Kay Jang  they all act as
Zack
's lackeys.
But as the series advances, Doo continues to change, he stops bullying other students and he starts to take actions on his own rather than being ordered around. This is evident following the downfall of Workers'
4th Affiliate
, in which he is taken in by
Workers
, due to Daniel forgetting to rescue him.
Despite not being strong, he helps out
Daniel Park
in his mission. Doo Lee is cunning enough to fool
Eugene
and pose as an Executive in the Workers' Second Affiliate.
Fighting prowess
Doo Lee possesses great strength, although lacks technique. This is shown in
Workers (2nd Affiliate)
when he punches
Daniel
in an attempt to fool the Second Affiliate, knocking him back. His younger brother Hyeondong Lee is also shown to be a veteran fighter in Questism - although with low potential.
History
Doo is initially portrayed as a bully at
J-High
, being one of
Zack's
lackies, with common targets being
Jiho
and
Daniel Park.
Doo, along with
Warren
and Daniel, go to the ONE MCN building in order to rescue Daniel's original body, as well as Like What and So Funny. He distracts most of the security guards by drawing attention to himself, allowing Daniel and Warren to find the secret floor where the streamers were held hostage. However, once their cover was blown, and the 4th Affiliate collapsed, Doo was taken and moved to the 3rd Affiliate, and employed as part of
Vivi
's clean up crew along with
Alexander Hwang
. Here, he helped out a captive
Daniel Park
, disobeying Vivi's orders to pour acid on him and bumping into the security guards at the entrance, allowing Daniel to escape. This is a pivotal point towards his character development, as he desires to have a fresh start.
Despite all this, Doo manages to avoid trouble and gets promoted to Executive in the Workers'
Second Affiliate
, due to Eugene overhearing his unique ideas that could be implemented into the fighting circus. He is next seen in the
Workers (2nd Affiliate) arc
, where he was known as Hannya. Here, he seems to have built up a reputation, lying about being a tough guy who's ultimate move is the "Dragon Fist", even being referred to by
Ryuhei
as
"..the only Korean [Ryuhei] acknowledge[s]".
While initially lashing out at Daniel for not saving him, he soon reveals key information about the circus, helping Daniel create a plan to take them down.
Doo manages to escape following the defeat of the 2nd Affiliate. Before he leaves, he has a final encounter with Ryuhei, where he confessed that everything he told him was a lie, including the "Dragon Fist", and he was just a bully. Ryuhei tells him to turn over a new leaf and become a Korean worthy of his respect. This is a major turning point for Doo, who decides to take his advice to heart.

Synopsis
Second Hand Rana Arc
Doo Lee, his two friends, and Daniel are initially recruited by Zack to help him confront the scammer who took his money, but after running into and recruiting
Euntae
, Doo Lee and the other two lackeys were told to stay behind with Euntae reasoning that too many of them would make the situation more complicated.
Autumn Boot Camp
On the bus to boot camp, Doo Lee, along with
Zoe
and
Yui
, ecstatically invite Daniel to sit with them (along with Zack, Jiho, and Mira) in the back of the bus where they play some games to pass time, much to Daniel's pleasure.
Later that night during the curfew, Doo Lee brings Daniel and Zack to a place where his two cronies and the Beauty Department girls (hoping to hang out with Daniel and Zack) were waiting for them. But both Daniel and Zack made excuses to get themselves out of there, much to the disappointment of Doo Lee and the girls. He, along with the two cronies and the Beauty Department girls were later caught by the camp instructors and forced to do squats as punishment.
The next night, Doo Lee assists Daniel, Jiho, and Zoe in searching for Mira and Zack. He suggest that they might just be hanging out and will return soon, but they keep searching regardless. Along with the police, they eventually find Zack beating up
Heemin Kim
after the latter attempted to rape Mira.
Attention Whore
Doo Lee offers
Park Tae Joon
to make a video with him on Pacebook, which he accepts. He then tries to offer Daniel to join him (hoping that his looks will get them views), but Zack tells him to shut up. Tired of being told what to do, Doo Lee reminds him that he spent his own money to buy things for him and that he should be thankful. Just before they're about to fight, they are separated as Doo Lee shouts that Zack has no friends, but rather underlings who do things for him.
In the Pacebook video Doo Lee makes with Tae Joon, they call out the gangster Shin Dae Hoon, gaining them popularity. Tae Joon worries about the possibility that Dae Hoon will respond, but Doo Lee assures that it's all going to be alright. As they make more videos targeting Dae Hoon which gets more and more attention every time, Dae Hoon finally responds after they make fun of his mom, saying that he will find and catch them, knowing that they both go to J High.

Duke Pyeon
(편독화 Pyeon Duk Hwa)
is a supporting character of
Lookism
. He is a student in the Vocal and Dance Department at
J High School
.
Appearance
In appearance, Duke is quite similar to Daniel (in his original body). He is so close in appearance to Daniel that when he was wearing glasses to cover for him at his job at the Mini Mart,
Crystal Choi
mistook him for Daniel when she looked at him from behind. Duke is obese and quite short as well, and much like Daniel, he is also by many referred to as 'Pig'.
Duke also changes his appearance a lot during the series rarely wearing the same clothes for long. When doing his live streams, he is usually shown wearing a black long sleeve shirt with some accessories at times.
Personality
Duke is very determined and is a very good rapper as seen at the time in the talent show when he did the duet with Daniel. Although he gets shunned a lot due to his appearance, he doesn't give up and writes his feelings down in a notepad as lyrics for future raps.

Background
He has a similar background to Daniel and lives with his grandma, he inspires to be like Eminem and would even be in Vocal and Dance Department to inspire his dreams.
Festival Arc
Duke was first introduced in chapter 21 being the last to audition in an entertainment company named DY right after his classmate from the vocal dance department. However, the president took one look at him and he was immediately dismissed without him being able to perform his piece. Frustrated by the unfair rejection he proceeded to take out all his emotions and turn them into lyrics. The next day in school the students in the vocal dance department were talking about the up incoming festival and discussing on who should perform Jin Ho and someone irrelevant was chosen to perform and Duke volunteered to perform as well and for that he received all kinds of back lash. While walking down the hallway he heard Daniel singing and asked him to sing with him in the festival. During their practice Daniel noticed their similarities and realized how amazing Duke was to be able to create such wonderful lyrics despite being in his situations as well as having the courage to try even after all the rejections he has received. At the start of their performance Daniel made a mistake so Duke covered for him and showed that he had his back they did really well and all the audience were surprised and Duke finally got the recognition he deserves. At the end of the performance the president of DY approached them and gave his business card and offered a job....to Daniel who humbly declined but that did not stop Duke.
Paprika TV Arc
After his 2nd rejection from DY, Duke started to perform his rap songs in Paprika. He barely got any views at the start but steadily began to grow and people started to recognize his talent.
Midterms Arc
In this arc Duke was relieved to be the top 5th person in his department so he helped tutor Daniel for the midterm exams.
Attention Whore Arc
Duke was briefly mentioned as one of the top three most well known paprika stars in school.
Illegal Toto Arc
Duke was seen discussing in a cafe about the trending illegal gambling game called Toto.

Welcome to Lookism Wiki's editing policy! To keep our pages consistent and organized, please do the following.
General Guidelines
All articles should be written in English.
Use the present tense when writing, unless it is about a past event.
Reference information as often as you can.
Page Format
Character Pages
Write the character names from the English translated Webtoon. Korean names are provided at the top of the page to clarify the character for readers that use other platforms.
Each character that is mentioned by name should get a character page. However, minor characters have a different character format than main characters, as they do not have enough information to warrant the usage of tabbers.
Relegate major plot information to the “History” and “Synopsis” sections of the character pages.
Please pertain to keeping information to the subject header. Many people will write other characters stories when it does not pertain to the page nor subject itself.

Episode and Arc Pages
Each episode that is released should get its own page.
Arc pages are meant to compile episodes from the same arc/chapter. They follow a similar format to episode pages.
Title each arc the way it was released. Title each episode with "Episode" and the number following. Example: Episode 56.
If an arc has the same as a character or organization in the story, add (Arc) at the end of the title. For example, Jake Kim is a character. His page is titled “Jake Kim”, and the arc named for him is titled “Jake Kim (Arc)”.

“
You're my family now. I will protect you.
”
Eli Jang
(장현 Jang Hyun)
is a secondary character in
Lookism
. He is a student in the beauty department of
J High School
,
Yenna's
father,
Heather's
love interest and one of the three children trained by
Tom Lee
. As well as the leader and founder of the
Hostel
. He briefly served as the president of the
Workers
‘ 5th affiliate, before joining Hostel with Allied.
Appearance
Eli Jang is considered to be attractive by many girls at J High School. He was referred to as, "an Angel from Heaven."
[
1
]
He has a tall stature and slender body frame, with pale skin and dark-colored eyes. On his back there are multiple scars including even a bullet wound he got while living on the streets. He used to wear rugged clothing when he was younger, but now he typically wears brand clothing or his school uniform.
Up until he was 15, he had long straight black hair. During the
Eli Jang Arc
, Heather had given him a haircut, where the sides of his head were shaved. Throughout the majority of the series, he is seen with his hair dyed blue with pink and lavender highlights, but as of the
Workers(3 Affiliates) Arc
, he is revealed to have changed it to a bleached blond mullet.
[
2
]
Now as the President of Workers 5th Affiliation, Eli dyed his hair back to black.
He has a letter-shaped scar on the left side of his forehead from his fight with
Darius Hong
[
3
]
that he covered with henna and later on with an "H" tattoo to commemorate his time with his friends and the creation of Hostel.
Personality
Eli Jang seems to be rather kind. He doesn't judge by appearance, seeing how he has a crush on Crystal's short body. This is possibly due to Crystal being similar to his dead lover, Heather. who is the mother of his daughter, Yenna. He also has a lot of self-confidence despite his terrible hair-cutting skills. He dreams to be a hairdresser when asked by Vasco what his dream is, this most likely have been influenced by
Heather
.
Eli Jang single-handedly defeats several members of the God Dogs.
He usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna; he did not protest even when some of the
God Dogs
treated him harshly, rather he apologized, seeking to end the argument peacefully.
He is very protective of his daughter Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he ever received. He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew.
In his past, Eli proved to be a very violent man as he grew up on the streets. He was willing to do just about anything to get what he wants. While he did display a very simple vocabulary he also showed to be very street smart given that he was able to come up with the idea of Hostel in the first place. However, despite his attitude, Eli only desired a family that cared for him and he is willing to do just about anything to protect and provide for them, as evidenced by him picking a fight with Gun to go see his daughter Yenna and him attacking
Johan Seong
for harming his allies.
Fighting Prowess
“
I'm not fighting Eli ever again. Because it felt like I'm fighting a beast.
”
— Warren Chae about Eli Jang's fighting style
Street Fighting and Savagery
Eli Jang is one of the most savage and aggressive fighters shown. His upbringing on the streets with
Mister Carpenter
coupled with his lack of formal martial arts training cultured fighting instincts often called "animalistic". He was so fearsome that Gun took him as his protégé, comparing his fighting style to his partner Goo's. Eli's fighting style can be surmised as pure efficient savagery, utilizing any-and-all attacks to finish the fight as succinctly as possible. This includes biting, groin grabbing, eye-gouging, headbutting, fiercely stomping a grounded opponent and using any weapon he can get his hands on. Interestingly, it is noted that his fighting style is a mirror copy of Tom Lee's by employees of the White Tiger Centre. His savage fighting style gets more dangerous when Eli is cornered. He uses his opponent's clothes or accessories to restrain or to inflict great damage on them as seen when he used Warren's clothing as makeshift handcuffs
[
4
]
and when he strangled Darius with his necklace.
[
3
]
After meeting Eli once again, Tom Lee remarked that he isn't as strong as he expected him to be and resolved to teach him everything again from scratch in order to awaken the real beast inside him. After a month of training and getting beaten up, Tom told Eli that he awakened something called the Animal Instinct, only then Tom acknowledges Eli and gives Yenna back to him.
[
5
]
Physical Endurance
Eli has great endurance as he was able to spring back up after being hit by powerful fighters like Warren Chae and Darius Hong. He is also quite powerful as he once knocked out Johan Seong in one swing of a flute and it is implied that after training with Gun he got much stronger giving Gun the scar on his chest when the latter decided to test him. He is strong enough to defeat
Ivan Park
and
Hope Park
, two fighters renowned for their physical strength, with ease.
[
6
]
Aikido and Weapon Use
Thanks to Gun's training, Eli now knows Aikido as a martial art and seems to have proficiency in the usage of stun batons. Gun remarked that he gave Eli a stun baton because he is too strong, metaphorically referring to that weapon as a chain to restrain Eli. His fighting method is proven to be efficient and effective as Eli could defeat singlehandedly Hostel A's mobs and Darius for the second time.
Hunt for Big Deal arc
In the hunt for Big Deal arc Eli became incredibly more powerful than before so much so that some underlings in Big Deal stated that Eli was overflowing with power and that
Mandeok
said that he has finally became a strong man and made up for the 3 year hiatus. This is proven even further with the fact that by this time he has played a crucial role in defeating two 1st Gen kings and taking over their territory. His endurance is so great that during the fight against
Sinu Han
even though he was bloody and beaten he still didn't fall to the ground until
Gun
finished the job.
Quotes
"As a dad, I won't hit anyone or abandon anyone or leave anyone all alone. You're my family now. I will protect you."
[
7
]
"
I won't cry from now on. Even when sad things happen, I promise to smile.. like you told me to."
[
8
]
"Yenna is not the only one that I've brought to life. I gotta be responsible for everything I give birth to because I'm a dad."
[
9
]
"Who told you to wear a necklace to a fight?"
[
10
]
"I was curious about middle school. The uniforms... Books.. And school lunches, all that. I was curious
."
[11]
"You guys were right. I was short-sighted. We are Gangdong. Gangdong will protect its own."
[12]
Etymology
Japanese
The name
Satoshi
means "intelligent, clever, bright" (聡).
Satoshi's surname
Isono
means "shore/seashore, beach" (磯) (
iso
) and "field, wilderness" (野) (
no
).
Trivia
He is the only male in the beauty department of J High School.
He is bad at cutting hair, yet girls want their hair cut by him anyways because he is attractive.
Jang Hyun is modeled by Aboki model Jang Hyun (same name).
During the Eli Jang Arc, it showed his tragic start in life, then how he survived as a runaway at 10 years old, then finally his quest for a normal life at age 15.
He was Gun's favorite choice for successor.
When he was younger, his hairstyle was an overgrown mullet.
The all-male architecture department feels jealous of him because he is always surrounded by girls.
He tries to always smile whenever he can because of Heather's late suggestion.
When in a state of motivation (the “animal instinct” power-up), Eli's left eye is drawn glowing green.
Eli (like many other male characters in Lookism) is stated in a comedic manner to have a large member.

He is the Author's favorite character along with Jiho Park

Family
Yenna Jang
Eli holding his daughter.
He is Yenna's father.
[
1
]
After Heather's death, Eli devoted his life to Yenna as a single parent. He often laments heavily whenever he can't spend enough time with her and has shown to be able to take abuse for her sake. However, if she is in danger, he will resort to his old self to protect her.  In fact, Yenna is primarily the only reason why Eli didn't want to get involved with Olly Wang's Hostel.
Friends
Sally Park
Sally took Eli into her home and was one of the few people he felt safe around. She had a crush on him but he never reciprocated her feelings. Regardless, he still considered her family and cared for her as a member of Hostel.
Warren Chae
Eli has a close relationship with Warren. While they did not get along in the beginning, he grew to accept Warren as the uncle of Hostel.
Love Interests
Heather
Heather and Eli after she gave him a haircut.
Heather is the girl Eli fell in love with and Yenna's mother. She influenced Eli to stop stealing and become a more optimistic person. Eli decided to quit Hostel so he could be there for Heather, but by then it was too late since she suffered an unfortunate death due to childbirth. It is implied that he became a hairdresser because that was Heather's dream.
Crystal Choi
Eli Jang seems to have shown interest towards  Crystal in her alternative body, as shown in Chapter 121
[
2
]
, in where he hands her a carton of milk, causing Daniel to feel jealous. Earlier, in chapter 79
[
3
]
, Eli had saved Crystal who was being harassed by a drunk Daniel. After the event, in chapter 80
[
4
]
, Eli gave his number to Crystal so that she may contact him whenever she needs him. Eli is known to put up a wall to the other girls at school and never gives his number away to anyone either. Crystal is the first to know about his secret life as a father (In Chapter 208
[
5
]
), and she does not judge him for it, instead she believes that Eli is a great father. Crystal even offered to take care of Eli’s daughter, Yenna Jang while he worked. Eli feels comfortable around Crystal and tries to befriend her through small actions. Her resemblance towards Heather in aspects of personality and actions seems to have sparked an interest.
Allies
Daniel Park
Eli Jang first met Daniel original body in Chapter 2, he gave him a haircut at the salon he worked at. When he first met Daniel in his alternative body, he wanted Daniel to model for him. Both of them are interested in Crystal, so they get jealous of one another.

Overview
As a child, Eli Jang lived in an abusive household. He ran away when he was 10 years old and met someone he referred to as
"Mister Carpenter"
who taught him how to survive alone on the streets and also some carpentry skills.
[
1
]
Some time afterwards he met Sally Park and her friends and decided to live in Gangdong with them. Together they formed Hostel, one of the
Big 4 Crew
, with Eli as their leader.
During his time in Hostel, Eli fell in love with a girl named
Heather
and conceived a child with her. When Heather died, Eli left Hostel to take care of his daughter, Yenna, and stopped fighting. It was shown that the reason he is interested in
Crystal Choi
(the original body) is because she reminded him of Heather.
Upon coming to J High, Eli became the crush of many beauty department girls, who complain that he disappears after school. The reason he avoids them is that he is very busy taking care of Yenna and working at his part-time job as a hairdresser.
Background
Eli Jang was subjected to a rough upbringing with his father abusing his mother. This led to his mother running away. Eli's father remarried, with the new wife beating him severely. Eli's father died from unknown circumstances with the new wife seemingly indifferent, implying she was involved with a life-insurance fraud involving Eli's father. In either case, the new wife remarried her old husband and brought in her biological children to Eli's household.
The mother continued her abuse and neglect of Eli, keeping him locked away whilst the rest of the family enjoyed their new dwelling. The only memorable interaction Eli had with his family was when he played a twisted version of hide-and-seek with his mother where once the hider was found, they would be severely beaten. This game warped Eli's conception of love with him coming to enjoy the game as this was the only time his new mother would come to seek him out. The culmination of Eli's childhood was his running away at the age of 10. On the streets, he was brought up by "Mr. Carpenter".
Eli Jang Arc
Chapter 232
Sally finds that
a cat
had let itself into her house. She follows the cat to find a homeless boy that had apparently snuck into her house. She is intrigued and asks what he is doing there, and he responds by calling her a bitch. The boy is
Eli Jang
in the past.
Chapter 233
Sally decides to allow Eli to stay in the spur of the moment. He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then "he will get in big trouble".
At school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.
Warren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park. He doesn't like how close she is to Eli and tries to intimidate him. Eli bites his nose and swears at him, and Sally realizes he is scared of Warren. Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.
Chapter 234
Sally tells Eli not to fight and Warren punches Eli. Sally then gets angry at Warren and tells him he is mean for hitting Eli. Warren walks away feeling hurt, but returns in the night claiming he will stay at Sally's so he can protect her. Sally protests but eventually allows him and his friends
Max
and
Derrick
to stay.
In Sally's house, Max, Derek, Warren, and Sally explain their backstories. They ask Eli to explain his backstory, and he tells them that he killed his dad.
Chapter 235
Eli claimed when he was younger, he used to have parents, but his father got drunk and would hit his wife. When Eli's mother ran away his father married a new woman who was physically and emotionally abusive towards him. When Eli's father died his wife married a new man who was just as abusive. Eli grew sick of his treatment and ran away from home with Lyon, saying that it was more comfortable on the streets.
Everyone is shocked to hear his story, and Warren asks if Eli has any good memories. Eli mentions a hide and seek game he used to play with his biological mother, and Sally suggests that they play. Eli doesn't want to play but the others race to find hiding spots. Warren opts out of the game, and Eli begins to count.
Max and Derrick are the first to be found. Lyon scratches Max and he yells, causing Eli to find him. Eli then suddenly attacks Max, and when Derrick comes to the rescue he beats up Derrick as well. Sally moves around during the game and finds Max and Derrick on the ground. She freezes and Eli finds her. Right as he is about to punch her he is stopped by Warren, who asks what he is doing. Eli explains that he is it, and Sally realizes that Eli was abused by his first mother as well.
Warren asks Eli why he didn't hit him back, and Eli says he doesn't fight unless he gets something from it. Warren offers Eli anything he wants if Eli wins to fight, and if he loses Eli has to leave Sally's place. Eli stands to fight him.
Chapter 236
Warren and Eli start fighting, and Warren notices that Eli fights very dirty, poking him in the eyes and kicking him in his manhood. When Warren is knocked to the ground Eli grabs a sign to smash his head in, and Warren sees that Eli has the eyes of a killer. Max and Derrick manage to hold Eli back, and Sally tells all of them to get out. They stop fighting because none of them want to freeze in the cold.
Sally asks Eli why he is fighting over her and he says he wanted to try on Warren's uniform. He explains that he only liked the hide and seek game because that was when his mother payed any attention to him. Warren gives Eli his jacket and calls the fight between them a draw.
At Sally's cram school she finds herself surrounded by Backdoor members. Her friend Olly Wang tries to diffuse the situation but is beaten. Eli shows up looking for Sally, and the Backdoor members mistake him for Warren Chae. He beats them all and Sally thanks him and introduces him to her friends
Heather
and
Olly
, later stating that if Eli hadn't met them their story may have been less tragic.
Chapter 237
Sally begins spending her food on her new roommates, causing her to miss school. Olly and Heather visit often, Olly because he likes Eli and Heather because she has a crush on Eli. Warren worries that Sally is running out of money, and to quell his fears Eli hands Sally a large stack of cash. Warren is shocked and asks where Eli got the money, but he won't tell them.
Olly follows Eli and asks him to show how he earns money. Eli shows him how to break into cars and steal money, and Olly is amazed by Eli's street smarts. He tells the crew he knows how to make money, and suggests they rob houses instead of cars. He even has a specific house whose patterns he studied. Warren is against it but Eli agrees with Olly, and they all go to rob a house.
When they enter the house Warren begins having second thoughts and is consumed with guilt. As he is about the leave Olly shows him the jewelry he found that they can sell. Eli compliments him but they are interrupted when the parents return. The father brings a stick and prepares to beat them but Olly intervenes and takes the hits so they can run. The father stops in shock as he realizes he hit his own son, because the house Olly decided to rob was his own.
Chapter 238
Warren beats Olly for hitting his parents, and is disgusted by his behavior. Olly asks why Warren cannot empathize with him, because he only robbed his house to help them. He explains that he feels trapped at home and wishes he had the freedom they had, even saying he wishes he was an orphan. Eli tells Olly that he understands him, but he needs to return home.
Olly is desperate to earn Eli's approval back. He begins robbing minors using Heather's photograph. He shows the money to Eli, but Eli is upset. He asks why Olly wants to be like him, when he has lived such a sad life. Olly disagrees with Eli, saying that his hardships are worth becoming as cool as Eli is. They are interrupted by Darius Hong, who mistakes Eli for Warren and gets too close to his face. Eli punches Darius and is horrified to see not only did it do no damage, Darius seemed to enjoy it.
Chapter 239
Eli Jang begins fighting Darius, but is overwhelmed by his strength. Darius doesn't take the fight seriously, and flirts with Eli as he beats him to a pulp. When Eli bites him he gets pissed off and throws him to the ground. Eli takes the opportunity to grab Darius by the necklace and choke him until he passes out. Back at the building Warren has beaten all the Backdoor members, and lays on the ground bloodied. He tells Sally not to worry, and Max and Derrick grumble that he cannot do anything without them.
The girls clean the boys' wounds and Warren complains that Sally sounds like a mother when she nags them. He then suggests that they become a family, since they have nobody else to take care of them. He proposes he will be the brother, and Eli proposes to be the dad, with Max and Derrick as brothers and Sally as the mother. Eli chooses the name 'Hostel' for their family, an acronym of their first letters of their names. Olly is upset that he isn't a member of
Hostel
, and Eli explains that unlike them, Olly and Heather have families.
Elsewhere
Gun
is upset that Backdoor was defeated so easily by Warren Chae. He disqualifies Backdoor as one of the four crews, and asks about Hostel.
Johan
tells Gun to forget about Hostel, and to give Gangdong to him if he can beat Eli Jang.
Chapter 240
Heather makes Eli promise not to steal after catching him in a store. They begin to spend a lot of time together. Sally knows that Heather likes Eli, which makes her sad because she also likes Eli.
She proposes to the others that they allow runaway children to live in her house, because she has a lot of room. When Warren asks how she will get the money, Eli suggests a point system of organized crime. Olly is impressed, but Heather is disgusted and tells Eli he can't engage in crime. Warren notices the romance budding between Eli and Heather and Sally's crush, which makes him upset.
Chapter 241
Jerry reveals that he was late to arrive because he was on the bus, but he intends to take over Gangdong. Warren makes Jerry promise to leave them alone, and Jerry agrees, stating Big Deal will take over Hostel. This doesn't sit well with Johan, who says he wants to take over Gangdong and defeat Eli Jang. Warren begs Johan to leave Eli alone but he refuses, saying if Warren wants to protect Eli he needs the strength to do so.
Warren in desperation bites Johan's foot, claiming one day he will do the same. Johan decides to step on him but before he can he is attacked by Eli, who bites him in the neck. Johan gets up and asks Eli who he is, and Eli tells him to not touch his family. Warren and Gun are shocked to see the savage look on Eli's face.
Chapter 242
As Gun marvels at Eli's savagery, Jerry and Johan quarrel over the right to Gangdong. Jerry says he will allow Johan if he can land a scratch on his face, and Johan uses Lyon to scratch him. Eli and Johan begin fighting, with Johan easily winning the fight. When Johan knocks Eli out, he asks Gun to give him the right to Gangdong. Gun refuses because Johan is too weak, and Eli proves this by knocking him out in one shot. Gun asks Jerry to take Johan home and asks Eli what makes him so desperate. Eli responds that he wants to take care of his family, and Gun is triggered and decides to destroy Hostel as revenge for ruining Backdoor. He begins his assault by grabbing Max and Derrick and threatening them. Warren laughs at Gun because Max and Derrick are the only people he ever lost to. Warren, Eli, Max and Derrick surround Gun and prepare to fight him four on one.
Chapter 243
As Gun is fighting Hostel he realizes they are stronger than he assumed. They push him pretty far, stopping his blows and even making him bleed. Gun eventually beats them and decides to take Eli's teeth as revenge. Before he can, Olly interrupts and tries to convince him that Hostel is as useful as the other crews, citing the runaway crew and point organization as evidence. Gun is impressed by their teamwork and gives Eli a phone to contact him by, making Hostel one of the
four crews
.
Chapter 244
Back at Sally's house Eli gets a haircut from Heather. He confesses his love for her and she tells him to continue to smile, even when life gets difficult. The boys renovate the building and decorate it to surprise Sally when she comes back. Heather and Eli decide to spend the night together at Sally's place.
When Eli and Heather wake up they see a scene of chaos. Sally's orphaned friends are returned to the orphanage and Sally's home is destroyed. Eli notices an officer glaring at them, and Heather realizes that this is her mother.
Chapter 245
Eli is brought into custody and interrogated by
Heather's mother
. She accuses him of ruining her daughter's reputation and tells him to stay away from her because he only causes people misfortune. Olly reveals that he called child services on Hostel in an attempt to get rid of Heather, but it backfired and broke apart Hostel. Sally becomes depressed and angry at Heather and accuses her of ruining everything.
Heather tries to tell Sally that she is pregnant but Sally refuses to speak with her. She begs Olly to help her find Eli and he hands Eli a phone to contact her by, but in reality she is contacting his number and he is filtering her messages. Eli begins training with Gun and establishes the runaway families to earn some money. When Heather tells Eli that she is pregnant Olly messages her to abort the baby.
Chapter 246
Heather is angry at Eli because of his text messages and he is doesn't know what is going on. When he realizes how hurt she is he decides to distance himself from her, believing he makes people miserable. She begins to cry and asks how he can tell her to abort his own child. Hearing these words, Eli tries to chase after Heather, but she leaves in a taxi and never returns.
Eli confronts Olly and begins beating him for causing the misunderstanding. Olly is unrepentant, saying Heather was only jealous and Eli would have said the same thing anyway. Olly then asks Eli where Lyon is, implying he killed him. Eli doesn't believe Olly and knocks him out. He tries to call Heather but reaches the gynecology clinic she is in. They inform him that Heather had an unexpected delivery that day, and he needs to show up immediately.
As Eli is about to leave he is stopped by Gun, who demands the monthly payment from Hostel. He is angry that Eli is not paying attention to his responsibilities as a head of a crew. Eli retorts that money cannot buy a family, and he is going to see Heather even if it means fighting Gun. Gun decides to test Eli, saying he will only allow him to leave if he is still alive after.
Chapter 247
(Last Chapter)
Gun beats Eli badly but decides to let him go out of sympathy for his situation. When Eli makes it to the clinic he finds out that Heather did not survive. The family holds a funeral ceremony for Heather and her mother blames Eli for her death. Eli accepts responsibility and is beaten by Warren, who is angry that Eli could ask for an abortion. The gang are upset but decide to leave Eli because they are too upset at how he treated Heather.
Gun finishes telling the story to rest of the story to
Goo
on in present time. After the incident Olly decides to kill Lyon the cat. He is stopped by someone but Gun doesn't say who it is, and ends the story there.
Eli visits the hospital where his baby
Yenna
is. He recalls Heather's words and decides to raise Yenna on his own. Before Eli leaves, he returns to his friends and suggests that they play a game of hide and seek. With those words he disappears, and has been missing ever since.
In present time
Daniel
and his friends and walking to school.
Logan
is jealous of his company and rages, throwing them all in the air. As he prepares to harass them Sally Park yells at him for knocking her to the ground.

Chapter 248
(Epilogue)
Sally and Warren introduce themselves to the gang, and are surprised to find

is a friend of theirs. They leave with those same words and meet Eli, who dyed his hair a mix of black and purple. They welcome him back into their family and catch up with each other.

Synopsis
Episode 232
The story begins with
Sally Park
, a middle schooler in Gangdong. Sally has a good life on the outside; she is pretty, has a lot of friends and her family owns a large building. She has a lot of boys wanting to date her, one of them being
Warren Chae
, an orphan from another middle school. She even tells Warren that she feels sorry for him, which makes him confused. In reality, Sally is an orphan who lives alone in an empty building. She feels sorry for Warren because she knows what it is like to be an orphan, and she longs for a family.
One night she finds
a cat
let itself into her house. She follows the cat to find a homeless boy snuck into her house. She is intrigued and asks what he is doing there, and he responds by calling her a bitch. The boy is
Eli Jang
in the past.
Episode 233
Sally decides to allow Eli to stay in the spur of the moment. He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then "he will get in big trouble".
At school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.
Warren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park. He doesn't like how close she is to Eli and tries to intimidate him. Eli bites his nose and swears at him, and Sally realizes he is scared of Warren. Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.
Episode 234
Sally tells Eli not to fight and Warren punches Eli. Sally then gets angry at Warren and tells him he is mean for hitting Eli. Warren walks away feeling hurt, but returns in the night claiming he will stay at Sally's so he can protect her. Sally protests but eventually allows him and his friends
Max and Derrick
to stay.
In a bathroom, Backdoor's leader
Darius Hong
is using the toilet when he hears that Warren Chae beat multiple members of Backdoor on his own. He decides to retaliate and asks if Warren is pretty.
In Sally's house, Max and Derrick explain their backstory to Sally. Max was abandoned in a clothing bin and Derrick was abandoned on a bus. Warren explains that he, Max and Derrick live in the same orphanage and that is how they met. Sally explains her backstory, that her parents died in an accident and left her the building. They ask Eli to explain his backstory, and he tells them that he killed his dad.
Episode 235
He claimed when he was younger, he used to have parents, but his father got drunk and would hit his wife. When Eli's mother ran away his father married a new woman who was physically and emotionally abusive towards him. When Eli's father died his wife married a new man who was just as abusive. Eli grew sick of his treatment and ran away from home with Lyon, saying that it was more comfortable on the streets.
Everyone is shocked to hear his story, and Warren asks if Eli has any good memories. Eli mentions a hide and seek game he used to play with his biological mother, and Sally suggests that they play. Eli doesn't want to play but the others race to find hiding spots. Warren opts out of the game, and Eli begins to count.
Max and Derrick are the first to be found. Lyon scratches Max and he yells, causing Eli to find him. Eli then suddenly attacks Max, and when Derrick comes to the rescue he beats up Derrick as well. Sally moves around during the game and finds Max and Derrick on the ground. She freezes and Eli finds her. Right as he is about to punch her he is stopped by Warren, who asks what he is doing. Eli explains that he is it, and Sally realizes that Eli was abused by his first mother as well.
Warren asks Eli why he didn't hit him back, and Eli says he doesn't fight unless he gets something from it. Warren offers Eli anything he wants if Eli wins to fight, and if he loses Eli has to leave Sally's place. Eli stands to fight him.
Episode 236
Warren and Eli start fighting, and Warren notices that Eli fights very dirty, poking him in the eyes and kicking him in his manhood. When Warren is knocked to the ground Eli grabs a sign to smash his head in, and Warren sees that Eli has the eyes of a killer. Max and Derrick manage to hold Eli back, and Sally tells all of them to get out. They stop fighting because none of them want to freeze in the cold.
Sally asks Eli why he is fighting over her and he says he wanted to try on Warren's uniform. He explains that he only liked the hide and seek game because that was when his mother payed any attention to him. Warren gives Eli his jacket and calls the fight between them a draw.
At Sally's cram school she finds herself surrounded by Backdoor members. Her friend Olly Wang tries to diffuse the situation but is beaten. Eli shows up looking for Sally, and the Backdoor members mistake him for Warren Chae. He beats them all and Sally thanks him and introduces him to her friends

and
Olly

Warren worries that Sally is running out of money, and to quell his fears Eli hands Sally a large stack of cash. Warren is shocked and asks where Eli got the money, but he won't tell them.
Olly follows Eli and asks him to show how he earns money. Eli shows him how to break into cars and steal money, and Olly is amazed by Eli's street smarts. He tells the crew he knows how to make money, and suggests they rob houses instead of cars. He even has a specific house whose patterns he studied. Warren is against it but Eli agrees with Olly, and they all go to rob a house.
When they enter the house Warren begins having second thoughts and is consumed with guilt. As he is about the leave Olly shows him the jewelry he found that they can sell. Eli compliments him but they are interrupted when the parents return. The father brings a stick and prepares to beat them but Olly intervenes and takes the hits so they can run. The father stops in shock as he realizes he hit his own son, because the house Olly decided to rob was his own.
Episode 238
Warren beats Olly for hitting his parents, and is disgusted by his behavior. Olly asks why Warren cannot empathize with him, because he only robbed his house to help them. He explains that he feels trapped at home and wishes he had the freedom they had, even saying he wishes he was an orphan. Eli tells Olly that he understands him, but he needs to return home.
Olly is desperate to earn Eli's approval back. He begins robbing minors using Heather's photograph. He shows the money to Eli, but Eli is upset. He asks why Olly wants to be like him, when he has lived such a sad life. Olly disagrees with Eli, saying that his hardships are worth becoming as cool as Eli is. They are interrupted by Darius Hong, who mistakes Eli for Warren and gets too close to his face. Eli punches Darius and is horrified to see not only did it do no damage, Darius seemed to enjoy it.

Daniel's Unnamed Former School
Summary
Smoking in the boy's bathroom,
Logan
and
Hyeji
remark how smelly it is before insulting one another. Annoyed, Logan focuses his attention on
Daniel
and orders him to stop any teachers from coming in. Soaked in fear, Daniel keeps quiet which unintentionally irritates Logan instead. Logan then proceeds to put his feet against Daniel's face, all the while ordering him to make various animal noises before his smashing his face onto a urinal.
Daniel is fat and poor, so Logan likes to pick on him. He frequently physically assaults him and takes his property by force. He also makes him do degrading acts like pretending to be an animal and being his personal ashtray. In addition to the degradation, he makes him do it in public, making him feel more pathetic and tormented as well. Logan's friend,
Panjun Kim
also joins in the bullying of Daniel Park. In the episode, Daniel is made to crawl from one classroom to another to give a flower to Hyeji Choi for their 100th day anniversary. Hyeji Choi pities Daniel for being bullied and angered for not standing up for himself. Daniel puts up with the abuse because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. He takes his aggression out on his
mother
, who doesn't know he is being bullied.
Seeing her son's aggression, Daniel's mother meets up with his teacher but is told that Daniel couldn't transfer schools due to his grades and transferring schools costing a lot of money (humiliating Daniel's mom due to her being poor).
One day at school Logan places a bet that Daniel cannot avoid his shot but he does. He bets that Daniel can dodge
Mae Kim's
shot, and Daniel couldn't dodge it. Logan begins beating up Daniel for not following the order he gave and making him lose the bet, and
Daniel's mother
witnesses this and approaches the bullies angered.

Summary
Jiho
had just gotten his mom to buy him a new Vibe limited edition backpack, and his friends were fawning over it. However, when Jiho was with
Jay
and
Daniel,
the girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Jiho thought it is because Jay and Daniel both had a lot of money to buy expensive clothes and silently berates them for not having to work hard to get expensive goods, even though his mother had bought him the backpack.
All of a sudden, Jiho notices that Jay had forgotten his wallet when he rushed over to Daniel's seat when Daniel said he didn't know how to do a problem. Jiho comments on how Jay's so good to Daniel it's ridiculous, running to him just because Daniel had called. Jiho is about to call out to Jay to tell him about his wallet, but decides to pocket it instead to play a prank on Jay.
Jiho, Jay and Daniel are later at the convenience store, and Jiho's thanking Jay for buying him a lot of snacks. Jay waves at him while Daniel translates that Jay's telling him it's fine and for him to eat up. The lady at the counter tells them it's 21500 won. When Jay reaches into his jacket to pay for the snacks, Jiho looks on expectantly, thinking he'll look ridiculous when he realizes his wallet's gone. However, Jay takes out his cell phone and pays with it instead. Jay and Daniel bow to the sales lady and leave.
Later, in the washroom, Jiho huffs, saying that it's no fun and that, if he had known, he would have just given Jay the wallet. He opens Jay's wallet to find pictures of
Enu
and an American Express credit card, which Jiho mistakenly thinks is a VIP card for a coffee shop. He then sees a 10 million won check in the wallet. Scared, he realizes he's landed himself in big trouble.
He then resolves to go and return the wallet to Jay, say he's just found it, and apologize, but decides to go and sneakily return it to Jay instead so Jay wouldn't know.
Jiho first tries to stick it in Jay's left pant pocket while walking past Jay. However, when he sneaks up to Jay, Jay sees three bees and hits them out of the air because Jay's scared of bugs. Jiho, after witnessing Jay's reflexes, decides to try another plan instead.
He then tries to put it in Jay's backpack after school is out. However, no matter how hard Jiho pulled on it, it wouldn't open. When Jay comes along, Jiho realizes it has a fingerprint lock.
Jiho then tries to catch Jay when he's leaving school, apologize, and return the wallet to him, only to have Jay rush away on a motorcycle.
As Jiho walks back home, he resignedly wonders how he can contact Jay again because he doesn't know Jay's phone number. After all, it's 10 million won. Then, Jiho realizes that all he has to do is put the wallet in Jay's desk. However, just as he realizes it, a trio of bullies come and forces him to exchange backpacks. Jiho belatedly realizes that Jay's wallet, containing the 10 million won, was still in the backpack they had stolen.

Summary
Jiho rushes to the convenience store where original Daniel works, and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that, although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow. Daniel then returns to the bullies with his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him. New Daniel then takes Jiho to Jay's home. They then see
Joy,
Jay's younger sister. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she's come over to play. Joy then tells them Jay's just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. Jay's answer is very frenzied, and Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and says it's not like her brother to do so. She then tells them Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel immediately begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl. He decides that it would be fine if he just threw the wallet inside of Jay's bedroom.
However, when Jiho opened the door, he saw Enu's pups inside, barking at him and telling him to leave because they thought he was a thief. They jump at him, biting him. Jiho flings them to the ground and throws the wallet at them, only to infuriate Enu for bullying her children. Enu starts to attack him.
Meanwhile, Joy greets Jay as he gets home. He's sweaty from running, panting and holding a plastic bag. She tells him she's come over to play and asks where he's been. Daniel explains that Jiho's come as well, and that, if Daniel had known earlier, he would have told Jay he was coming beforehand. Jay, seeing Daniel, immediately starts cleaning the room, while Joy tells him it's already clean. Jiho walks out, clutching at his arm and limping, his clothes ripped. Enu barks from behind, saying that she'd caught a thief. That's when Jiho sees the bag Jay is holding, which is full of 10 million won checks. Daniel says that he didn't know Jay had gone out collecting the checks, and that Daniel had a lot of them too. It turns out that the checks were just pamphlets promoting the online clothes shop that Daniel poses for, and Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho realizes that all his work was for nothing and faints.

The day before, Jay was walking through the streets when he receives a pamphlet for the clothing store that Daniel works for. People were throwing them away when they realized they weren't checks. When Jay puts Daniel's picture in his wallet, he smiles.

Summary
Vasco
realizes that, even though original
Daniel
had persevered in exercising for 3 months already, he wasn't getting any thinner. So he's determined to find out why. That day, Vasco followed Daniel to the convenience store.
When a customer began to berate Daniel for not heating up the food and was acting really confrontational, Vasco told him to heat it himself, and that store employees are still people. Daniel tries to get Vasco to stop because the customer is known for his bad temper, but, instead, the customer apologizes meekly.
Later, when a middle-aged looking woman comes over to buy alcohol, Vasco asks for her identification. Angered, she asks how old they were to be ordering her around. Vasco replies he's 16. Daniel tries to explain that the lady has bought alcohol every day already, but, instead, the woman apologizes and calls Vasco "oppa," showing that she was actually younger than them.
When nobody was coming, Daniel began to exercise during the break. Vasco watches him, wondering why he wasn't losing any weight even though he was so diligent. Suddenly, Daniel sits down, saying he's very tired so he should replenish his energy. He starts wolfing down a hamburger. Vasco realizes the reason why Daniel can't lose any weight is because he's eating so much and orders that Daniel goes on a diet. Daniel can't stand it, and starts wondering why his other body wasn't getting fat even though they both eat the same amount. All of a sudden, he realizes the fifth truth: his other body's shape can't change.
The next day, at the cafeteria, Daniel heaps food onto his plate and wolfs it all down. Girls, seeing him, giggles and says he eats like a man. However, when Ji Ho tries to do the same thing, they call him uncivilized and dirty instead.
However, at night, Daniel realizes that, no matter how much his new body eats, his original body is still very hungry. When he goes training with Vasco in the morning, he feels weak and hungry. He takes out a banana that he had saved from before, but Vasco snatches it away, saying that he shouldn't eat it. Daniel starts to cry, and, when Vasco takes a large bite of the banana, something breaks within Daniel because, whenever Daniel is very hungry, he would lose control. He rushes at Vasco, arms flailing. Vasco tries to tell him to calm down a little, but Daniel punches him hard, and Vasco is only barely able to block it.
Notes
Despite Daniel exercising every day, he still hasn't managed to lose weight. Vasco has some doubts. But In later Episodes he loses his weight.
It is the first episode in the english translation to get a name.

Summary
After
Daniel
punched him,
Vasco
, frantic, gets into a fighting stance, trying to tell Daniel to calm down. As Daniel lunges to punch Vasco he hits Daniel in the neck, rendering him unconscious.
Daniel wakes up in his new body, embarrassed that he had acted the way he did. He realizes that he had completely lost control and puts on his jacket to go and find Vasco and his unconscious other body. However, just as he tries to call Vasco, he sees his vision blurring again.
It turns out that Vasco, had woken him up by sticking the banana in his mouth. Apologizing and crying, he promises that Daniel can eat the banana. Daniel, realizing that his other body was now lying unconscious somewhere, tries to tell Vasco not to wake him up, only to feel himself losing consciousness again.
Daniel wakes up in his new body to see
a girl
above him, trying to wake him up. She asks if he's alright and apologizes, saying that she saw him suddenly faint. Daniel wonders if there had been someone there earlier, but thinks nothing of it. Thinking he must have scared her, he reassures her that he's fine and thanks her. The girl suddenly retreats, apologizing for touching him, and Daniel, thinking she must be very introverted, says she shouldn't apologize and if anything he should thank her for helping him.
At that moment, Vasco rushes over crying with original Daniel on his back. He explains that he called the emergency number 102 but nobody picked up. Daniel tells him it's 120, but secretly feels relieved that it was Vasco to find his body, because he couldn't remember the number to call the ambulance. Meanwhile, the girl thinks that Daniel has fallen in love with her and that, this time, her love wasn't one side. At the same time, she picks up the key to Daniel's room that Daniel had accidentally left behind.
In a flashback, the girl remembers her backstory. She used to have a crush on a boy called
Heemin
, but he rejected her because she was ugly. In school when she was older people would gossip about her, saying she's gloomy and that they're unlucky because they have to work in the same group with her for a project. Even now her neighbors would still gossip about her, going so far as to say that she should leave because she was bringing down the house prices. She would scratch at her arm, thinking that nobody loves her that she was very lonely.
The scene then cuts to PTJ's CEO
DG
.
Crystal
asks DG what he's plotting with her dad because her dad doesn't tell her anything. She congratulates him because he's looked happier after becoming the CEO, but he says that his good mood isn't because of his job but because his stalker finally stopped contacting him.
Daniel is working in the convenience store while a storm is going on. He thinks to himself that it would be terrible if he had lost his key in this weather, so it's lucky that he found the key outside his front door. Meanwhile, his new body sleeps at home. As the thunder rolls, the girl he had met that morning crouches in front of him, grinning.

Summary
Daniel wakes up the next morning to find that all the dishes in the sink were clean. He is confused because he doesn't remember cleaning the plates, but blames it all on the diet, saying that he's been rather forgetful lately. When he leaves to go to school, he sees the girl shivering outside his front door. She calls out Daniel's name and makes small talk with him. He wonders why she is sitting in the cold and realizes that she's eating something as well, but he doesn't comment on it.
She suddenly holds out her hand and asks if Daniel likes her ring, the same ring that she had shown her childhood crush. Daniel tells her it looks really pretty and asks if she's made it herself. Just when she's about to ask him another question,
Zoe
shows up, offering to walk to school with him. The girl grows jealous of Zoe, who doesn't notice and hands her a hot pack. When they leave the girl remembers how Daniel had told her to go back home and believes Daniel would love her alone. She then takes out the key to his home, saying that she'll listen to him and return to their "love nest."
When she enters Daniel's home, she says "I'm back," as if she were returning to her own home. She then smiles that hes's used her dishes, which she licks clean. The girl goes to fold the sheets, only to find original Daniel sleeping in them. She gets angry and grabs a kitchen knife to kill him.

Summary
At that moment Daniel arrives, coming home after a rough day. He looks around and sees that the room's suddenly become cleaner and wonders if he's hallucinating. He then notices the kitchen knife lying on the ground next to his mattress and the dishes are washed. As he takes a shower, he decides that his mother couldn't have come over and wonders if it is a manifestation of his dual bodies. Meanwhile, the stalker watches him take a shower.
As Daniel dries his hair, he walks over to his original body, slapping himself awake to get ready for work.Then, he uses his new body to continue drying his hair, saying that he doesn't want to go to work and deciding to eat before he goes. All this time, the stalker watches, wide-eyed, from behind the bathroom door.
Crystal walks by Daniel's home to see the stalker taking out the trash. She says that there are only two boys living inside that house, and asks who she is. The stalker replies that she and Daniel are one and that they are family. She then asks if Crystal is his friend. Crystal replies "ah, yes" whist wondering if the stalker is his sister. The stalker girl, angered by this reply, asks if they are close, and Crystal is scared and answers no.
Meanwhile, at Daniel's convenience store, Zoe is speculating whether or not the girl is stalking Daniel because she says she'd seen her before too, but hadn't paid much attention. She says that, now that she thinks about it, it seems kinda strange and wonders if the girl might have entered Daniel's home. At that moment, Crystal barges in worriedly, sweating from running. Crystal and Zoe both wonder who the other is, because they keep seeing each other around original Daniel. When he asks if she needs anything, Crystal replies that she's not there to buy anything but wants to know if he has a sister. He rushes home, scared, and looks around, only to find nobody there.
The next day, Daniel tapes pieces of tape to the door, and, when he rushes home, realizes that they hadn't been touched, showing nobody had opened the door during the day. He pushes the door open, and sees nothing has been touched and everything was just as messy as before. He rushes to the sink and is incredibly relieved to realize that the dishes hadn't been washed either.
In a moment of dramatic irony, the scene cuts to a cockroach, and then zooms out to show that it was crawling on the stalker girl's face as she lies in the space under the kitchen sink, grinning and saying that, as long as she's able to see Daniel, she would be happy. As she lies under the sink, she sees original Daniel slap his new body to get ready for school, and wonders why, whenever he switches bodies, one of them falls unconscious. She grins creepily as she realizes that it means that she should be able to take one of them.

Summary
The next morning, Daniel and Crystal see each other while jogging. Crystal asks him whether he comes exercising everyday after work. Daniel replies yes, and that he exercises with a friend (Vasco) every morning before going home. Crystal, finding something in common, exclaims that she also often exercises as well. Daniel looks at her suspiciously, wondering if she's bragging about staying in shape. At the same time Crystal thinks that original Daniel is kind, fond of small animals, determined, and hard working, and wonders why someone as good as him would live with someone like new Daniel.
She asks Daniel whether the stalker's been coming around anymore lately, and he replies that no, she hasn't, and thanks Crystal for helping, but asks how she knew which place was his. Crystal, not wanting to reveal that she's been investigating him under orders of her father, explains that she saw it when she came over to feed Enu. The stalker angrily wonders who she is and decides she must have her eyes on new Daniel and wants to steal him away.
Zoe comes over right afterwards, asking if he'd seen the stalker again and offering to walk to school with him. She then notices how the place where Daniel lives isn't really fancy so she asks what Daniel's parents do. He answers that his mother does a little of everything and Zoe mistakenly believes that his mother's in charge of a huge company that dabbles in a bit of everything and is incredibly impressed. Unbeknownst to them, the stalker watches them from within Daniel's room, and thinks that Zoe is there to seduce Daniel as well. She wonders when the permission form will be sent to her, and frantically check her cell phone only to smile when she realizes that it's just been approved.
While at school, Daniel tells his classmates about his stalker. Zoe offers to walk with Daniel to school every morning, and says it'll be great if original Daniel comes along as well. Jay suddenly hands Daniel a utility knife and tells him to keep it. Daniel doesn't know why Jay is handing it to him but accepts. As he looks down at his hands he sees the ring the stalker had on, and realized that it must have been put onto him while he was asleep, showing that the girl was still in his home.
Frantically, he runs back home and realizes that his original body had disappeared. He looks all over the place for a sign of the stalker. When he checks the space under the kitchen sink, he realizes that, although nobody was there, there were a lot of soiled adult diapers. The stalker girl appears behind him and tasers him.

Summary
When Daniel wakes up, he finds that he isn't in pain and realizes that he's in his original body, but he can't move because he's been bound. The stalker is seen coming out of the bath, talking to an unconscious Daniel. She says that the two of them can live together forever, and that she's put the "annoying pig" in a place where nobody would ever find him.
Meanwhile, original Daniel tries to scream under the tape on his mouth and flails in his bonds. He tries rolling around and falls onto the ground. Suddenly, he feels something sharp and starts to use it to cut at his bonds. When he is finally able to take off his blindfold and open his eyes, he finds himself in a room that is covered with his own photographs. He realizes he'd fallen out of the closet full of wine bottles, and the sharp object he had used to cut off the ropes was actually a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After wondering for a while what he should do, he decides to run to the police office.
The policeman, upon hearing his story, are surprised at hearing his story and commends him for running to report it immediately. When Daniel gives his address, the first policeman tells Daniel to wait a moment because the address Daniel had given was an hour away from the police station, which didn't fit with Daniel's story that he had directly ran to the police office after he saw the crime. The police then comments on how Daniel smells of alcohol, and decides he must be drunk. When Daniel replies he hadn't drank, the police admonish him for lying and begin interrogating him.
Suddenly, Daniel loses consciousness as his other body wakes to find himself bound to a chair with his arms behind his back. They're in another room that's also covered with pictures of himself, and there's a circle of candles surrounding them. He asks her why she's doing this to him, to which she replies that they are one. She explains that this is their new home, and she'd specially decorated it for him, and that there were even some couple photos of them. She also explains that she's eating his fingernails and toenails as a snack, which she ate earlier when Daniel saw her outside his door.
Daniel exclaims that she can't do this, that she'd also kidnapped his "friend" and that this was illegal. However, the stalker only turns around, grinning, saying that she knew his "little secret".

Summary
The stalker girl reveals that she knew about the fact that Daniel had two bodies, and that he changes by slapping himself. Daniel doesn't correct her, and decides to figure out where he is. When she refuses to tell him, he says that he won't marry her. The stalker is angry, thinking he's lying to her, and tasers him again.
When Daniel wakes up in his original body, he's still in the police station, and the police still think he's lying. He asks Crystal for help. The police promise to help and are very reverent towards Crystal because it turns out she's very close to the department head. When Crystal asks how Daniel had contacted her without a cell phone, he explains he'd sent a message to original Crystal and asked her to pass the message on. Crystal offers to help find new Daniel, and Daniel thanks her and leaves, saying he's already found a lead.
Crystal calls
Kouji
and tells him to locate Daniel's cellphone. The Kouji tells her that he's not going to do it, but Crystal only tells him Daniel's phone number and hangs up. She looks incredibly angry and says that nobody should bully her Daniel.
Original Daniel, on the other hand, heads to a telephone stand where he calls the number of the noodle restaurant where the stalker had called for takeaway. He'd memorized the phone number of the restaurant while tied up in his new body. He asks the restaurant to tell him the address of the woman who'd called for two bowls of noodles. However, when the restaurant owner hears his request, he seems to mistake Daniel for a stalker instead and hangs up.
Crystal had already gotten the address from the Kouji through text. He tells her that it's a good thing Daniel's cell phone was still on, and tells her she shouldn't go alone and should bring Gun with her. She replies that Gun had went with Goo out of the country, and that it was an emergency, so she can deal with any danger by herself. The Kouji replies that it's true, she isn't pretty when she gets mad either, and tells her that it's free this time, but he wants her to think over his last request some more. As she gets closer to the address the Kouji's sent her, Crystal starts to get a little scared. However, when she arrives, she starts because she realizes she's been here before.

The stalker girl appears behind Crystal, and tasers her, believing she is there to seduce Daniel. She ties her up in a chair next to Daniel, saying that they should settle this dispute between themselves before “her husband” wakes up. Crystal then says that she knows the stalker, because she was also DG's stalker. The stalker asks if Crystal is talking about her ex-boyfriend, and says that she seems to have an interest in all of the stalker's past boyfriends. She continues to say that Crystal can have DG because she is already married now. The stalker's wearing a headdress, a white dress, and holding flowers, but Crystal realizes that the headdress is actually lace underwear and the stalker’d made the wedding dress herself.
Crystal asks her if she knows what she's doing. After all, she'd already kidnapped 3 people already. The stalker laughs and tells Crystal how she'd always been discriminated against because of her looks, but immediately starts talking about how a pig (original Daniel) would dare to sleep in her spot without even realizing how unfit he is. Crystal points out this discrepancy, telling the stalker that, even though she blames society's lookism, she herself is only attracted to handsome guys. Angered, the stalker lunges forward to taser her, only for original Daniel to walk in through the door.
In a flashback, original Daniel had continued to call the noodle restaurant, telling the owner that he was trying to help a friend who was in danger. The owner, hearing that he was trying to help a friend, changes his mind about the matter extremely quickly and tells Daniel the address. To his surprise, it turned out to be his home.
The stalker asks how he changed bodies when she hadn't slapped him, and Crystal is surprised to hear this. Daniel wants to use his strength to defeat the stalker, but the stalker throws a candle at him, and, when he's dodging the candle she tasers him. He falls unconscious and wakes up in his new body. Meanwhile, Crystal starts crying for the stalker to stop hurting original Daniel while the stalker continues to electrocute his unconscious body. She calls the girl a stalker, and the stalker tries to taser her but Daniel takes the hit, telling her not to hurt Crystal. The stalker begins to hit Daniel repeatedly until he is covered with blood.
She then tells him he should apologize, because then she'll forgive him, but she doesn't know he is only buying time for Crystal to escape while handing her Jay's utility knife. However, even though Crystal's hand was on the door knob, she hesitates to leave him behind.

Summary
The stalker noticed Daniel looking in her direction and launches herself at her, taser out. The scene cuts to
Gun
who is on the phone with the
Kouji
. He tells him that Crystal had left alone, and worried for her, had phoned Gun to ask when he was coming back from overseas. Gun says he's coming back soon, and that Goo was still having a lot of fun beating someone up. He continued to say that he isn't worried about her because he'd taught her some moves earlier.
Crystal kicks the stalker's head,causing blood to come out of the stalker's mouth. She says that this is a lot less than Daniel had to suffer and locks the door, telling the stalker to prepare to have her ass handed to her. The stalker cries and tries to squeeze Crystal but she aims her elbow at the stalker's back, incapacitating her in one blow. As the stalker falls to the ground, Crystal uses the taser to electrocute her. Daniel, thanks her, and she asks him why he'd let her go earlier. When he replies that it's because she's a girl, she continues to say that the stalker's a girl too, and tells him to stop judging people based on their looks. She realizes this may be the first time they’d seen each other for who they were inside.
The police had arrived and had put the stalker in handcuffs. As the stalker is led to the police car, she cries for her "husband", trying to explain that her "husband" had two bodies. Meanwhile, the people around her snicker, saying she's lost her mind. Daniel smiles, thinking that nobody would believe the stalker's words, but, behind him, Crystal, wide-eyed, seems to realize the truth.
Epilogue
The stalker girl asks two guys if they like her ring, and they answer that it's really pretty, if she made it herself, and that she was very good with her hands. They ask her if she has an accessories shop and where it's open. It turns out that the stalker had become really pretty. While in prison, she met a girl who had kept some makeup from the guards, realized the stalker girl could become really pretty, and taught her to apply makeup. When the stalker girl leaves prison, she uses the new technique to look beautiful, and she suddenly realizes that everyone's asking her for contact information and even offering her jobs. The story ends with the girl from prison telling her the moral that who you are inside doesn't matter because, in this world, everyone only cares about appearances.

Summary
Daniel
sits on the bed in the Nurse's Room, thinking deeply about how to avoid
Logan
. He comes to the conclusion that since Logan is in a different class, it won't be difficult to avoid him. Daniel gets up and tries to open the door so he can leave but the door won't budge because Logan is also trying to open it from the other side.
The scene then cuts off to
Vasco
and
Jace
walking down the hallways with the freshmen greeting them with respect. Vasco notices
Leonn
greet him casually. Vasco asks him for his name and the people tell him to speak formally to his senior, Vasco. Leonn states that Vasco promised to fight him in the past. Vasco is still unable to remember and this angers Leonn, who then proceeds to kick Vasco in the shin out of frustration. Vasco collapses and Jace asks Vasco if that Leonn's kick hurt him that much and Vasco says it was Logan's attack that did it. Vasco labels Logan as a 'punk' and comments that he's unbelievably strong.
The scene switches back to Daniel and Logan. Both of them continue to attempt to open the door with unbelievable strength and force and the door finally opens and Daniel accidentally bumps into Logan. Daniel panics, remembering that the two have actually met before and hopes that Logan doesn't recognise him. Logan tells him to piss off and Daniel attempts to leave. Suddenly,
Zoe
holds Daniel's arm and asks him if he's okay. Remembering his insecurity around handsome guys who always have girls follow them around, he stops Daniel with anger.
A flashback to Logan's past is shown, when he had his first girlfriend. Logan used to date
Mae's
old girlfriend, who liked him because he was strong. She cheated on Logan for a handsome guy, and from that day on Logan hated handsome guys. He also became violent towards women. He grabs Daniel's shoulder and is surprised when he doesn't back down.

Cutaways ensued showing that the priest used hallucinogens to convince Johan's mother to convert herself away from Christianity. Johan and Zack fought their way towards Mira. However, the priest was guarded by his dogs and had a bucket of meat to coax his dogs. Since Johan and Zack were stuck at an impasse, they were hesitant. Mira then bit the priest in the leg buying enough time for Johan's mother to suddenly douse the priest in a concoction that lured his dogs to eating him alive.
The reporter from earlier called in the police and took over the case. Zack comforts Mira and Johan's mother was taken to a rehabilitation center leaving Johan alone once more. Afterwards he goes missing only to show up during the boxing completion that Zack was also participating in.

The girl runs off in tears and almost trips when Vasco catches her. He tells her he is sorry for being a terrible date, and that he is only inexperienced. The girl falls for his kindness and decides to give him another chance. Jace is happy to hear it but Leonn is not. She kicks him and walks away, and Jace suspects she has a crush on Vasco.
Near the Han river Leonn skips stones, upset that Vasco's date is going so well. Vasco appears with the fireworks and asks if he is late to the event. Leonn is surprised that he remembered, and Vasco tells her he left his date because the Burn Knuckles are more important to him than love. She chases him with the firecracker and laughs at his stupidity.

Vasco explains to the girl that he cannot date her because he wants to raise a kangaroo. He leaves her to go to the Burn Knuckles, and Jace is confused.

. This secretly makes Daniel feel miserable and immense guilt and he even called himself the 'world's biggest piece of trash'. After school his mother sits him down and confirms that she allows him to transfer. Daniel realizes that his mother knew that he was getting bullied but pretended not to know, and he starts crying. Despite feeling guilty, Daniel listens to his mother and decides to start fresh. Daniel finds his new home which turns out to be an old shack. Daniel goes to
a hair dresser
and has his hair cut to a 'two-block' hairstyle, but he ends up looking like Kim Jong Un
[
1
]
, but Daniel doesn't get the hint as he is too immersed in his own world .
On his way from the hairdresser he spots
Mira Kim
looking at him. He thinks that she is interested in him (while she thinks he is weird), so he smiles at her, which ironically creeps her out.
Zack Lee
sees Daniel smile at Mira and gets jealous, but Mira prevents him from fighting. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behavior. However, Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Unable to keep his anger under control, Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders take pictures and upload them online.
That night, Daniel cries himself to sleep because he had gone viral online, and had lost his chance at a new start. When he wakes up, he goes to the bathroom to check his probably tear-swollen eyes and finds that the ceiling and sink look much lower than before. He then finds himself looking very different, with a slim figure and extraordinarily handsome appearance. He stays in utter shock before falling out of the bathroom in confusion and bewilderment, only to find his old body which is found to be sleeping peacefully on the floor.

Summary
Leonn Lee has started working at a gas station because she wants to be close to Vasco. She has to dress like a girl for her job to attract customers, so Vasco doesn't recognize her yet.
At the karaoke place the animation department is touched by Logan's dedication towards them. Hope Park is a fighter who relies on his strength, so having Logan beat him is unacceptable. He tries to rush Logan but Logan uses his jiujitsu skills to slip past and hold him in a lock. As he passes out he fears that Johan will have to fight a monster.
Back at the gas station Vasco is surrounded by God Dogs, who ask him to wash his car. Vasco agrees to the task, unaware of the implications.
Johan

Summary
Johan is surprised to see Vasco won't fight back against him. Vasco explains that he is only fighting to protect his friends, because power exists to protect others. Johan is triggered at this response and beats him viciously, but Vasco doesn't budge. He is angry that he cannot win against Vasco and decides to leave. Jin begins beating Vasco to keep him quiet and doesn't stop until Johan glares at him. Johan confirms that people only listen to power, and walks away fuming.
Jin buys gas and orders Vasco to drink it, using the other Burn Knuckles as hostages. Vasco looks to his peers then opens his mouth, but is stopped by Leonn Lee. Leonn brings the first year Burn Knuckles and shouts that they are not worthy if they cannot protect Vasco. Vasco is moved and realizes he doesn't have to fight on his own. He tells the Burn Knuckles they can begin fighting back, and Jace assembles the sophomores to beat the God Dogs.

The Burn Knuckles quickly recover and mow down the God Dogs. Jace knocks out Mark Sa, who assumed he was the weakest due to his status as an analyst. Jin Jang quickly surrenders to Vasco but he rejects his apology and tells him to stand up for his beating. He thanks Leonn for calling the rest of the crew, as he learned to rely on others.
Zack leaves the boxing ring and remembers a conversation with his coach. His advice was that Zack stop fighting with emotion, and that was the only way to beat his opponents. Zack remembers the coldness Johan showed him during their last fight and wonders if he can fight like that.
He returns to the ring to find Scott Kwon waiting for him. Scott harasses him and asks about Vasco, but he ignores him and starts training. When Scott hits Zack and he does not respond, the coach gives him his gloves, congratulating Zack on controlling himself. Zack puts them on and tells Scott to come to the ring.

He is torn between his old self who was loved and his current self who is powerful. When Daniel approaches him he asks if they are still friends.
Zack is running when he comes across Scott, who wants a rematch. He refuses because they are not in a match, but when Scott is persistent he beats him and his gang. Scott recognizes Zack as second place in the middle school boxing match, and mentions that the first-place winner is his leader, Johan Seong. Elsewhere, Johan asks Daniel to join to God Dogs.

Eli races to Crystal's aid and ruins the hair of Dominic Min, who chases him angrily. When Dominic finds out Eli is a father he begins harassing him, and brings a cigarette close to Yenna. Eli smashes his face in the wall and warns him to stay away from his daughter before beating all the God Dogs in the room.

Summary
All the guys stand facing each other, not knowing what to do. Vasco states he will punish them all and they begin fighting each other. Johan interrupts the fight by hitting them all, then tells Daniel to join him. He tells Daniel that money is power, and asks if he has something he wants to protect. A large amount of God Dogs appear behind him, and Logan and Vin team up to fight them.
Vasco attacks Johan and Johan counters with Vasco's own kick. He tries to punch Vasco but his fist is caught by Daniel. Daniel rejects Johan's offer and tells him he looks unstable. He explains that power is useless if you lose what you are trying to protect, because that would leave you all alone. Vasco stands by Daniel and the rest of the Burn Knuckles appear to back him up.
Daniel asks Johan to stop the fighting and send his gang home. Johan laughs at Daniel and attacks him, simultaneously holding his friends back. He tells Daniel without power he can't protect anything, and tells his men to fight the Burn Knuckles. He is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. Daniel is shocked as the God Dogs laugh that they waited this long just to attack Johan.

Summary
Logan and Vin realize they have no reason to be there anymore, but stay to watch the fight. Johan lunges at Gun and begins remembering pieces of his past.
After Johan's mother was taken to rehabilitation he visited her and learned she needed a cornea surgery. He dropped out of school and began stealing expensive shoes from street thugs and reselling them for money. He was approached by Gun in an alleyway, and Gun offered him a position as a head of a crew. Johan took the job and took over Jin Jang's old crew to earn money for Gun. When Johan collected enough money he went to a doctor but learned that his mother was at the bottom of a waiting list. He begged Gun to move her up the list and Gun gave him the task of uniting the four crews.
During the fight Gun notices how much Johan has improved. He can fast enough to hit Gun, and does so multiple times. He is powerful and very skilled, but it is not enough to beat Gun. Gun states that Johan's only weakness is that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with a one punch.
As Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him. He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out the way by Zack. He asks if Johan is okay and Johan stops crying. Gun asks Zack who he is and Zack calls himself Johan's friend.

Summary
Jace decides Gordon Park is lying because he was in the room and he did not leave after getting the book. Yui is lying because she was still wearing makeup despite washing her face. Zack was clearly asleep, because
Mira
would never ask him on a date. Logan was not in the nurse's log, so he also lied. Vin and Mary's stories contradict each other, but the cafeteria lady did confirm Vin came with a girl to the café.
Jace is upset and thinks he can't solve a case when he remembers his grandfather's advice: always go to the crime scene. He comes across the
Burn Knuckles
destroying the place and finds a small gem. He sees a CD in the room and puts everything together. Jace goes to the homeroom teacher's office and declares the culprit.

Summary
Jace explains that Yui did go to the bathroom, but not to wash her face. Her pills were laxatives, and the noise Zack heard was her going to the toilet. She is acquitted. The singing that Yui heard was not Duke but his CD Vin listened to in the bathroom; he is also acquitted. Zack is acquitted because he was clearly asleep.
Mary is acquitted because she was at the lecture at the time. Logan claims he did it but Jay-Gal denies it, saying the reason Logan was absent was to give Zoe a picture he drew of her. He leaps out the window with Jay-Gal and the both of them are acquitted. Mr. Park is also acquitted, because Jace only saw him looking, and he did nothing more.
The real culprit was
Jasmine Huh
. She lies about being rich and then placed her wallet in Vasco's locker to pretend her money was stolen. She pretended to be Mary and went with Vin to the café, but he didn't notice because his glasses were too dark. The last piece of evidence is the small gem from her headband she left at the crime scene. Jasmine is revealed to be a mythomaniac, a perpetual liar. Jace ends the case happy with himself, and with a bunch of new enemies.
Cookie is Gordon Park giving Jasmine her wallet with all the money in it. He placed his own money in there because he genuinely believed Jasmine lost her money, and complains that his wife will be mad.
Later, a weirdo wearing a stocking mask tries to sell an internet café computer to some strangers. When they refuse him he beats them with a keyboard and escapes the scene. He is approached by members of Hostel, and removes his mask to reveal himself as

is walking to school when a man asks to buy her spit. She runs away and the man is pursued by Logan, who beats him senseless.

Jasmine is still lying about her life and Zack is annoyed. Mira tells him the story of the boy who cried wolf and tells him to have faith in Jasmine. Jasmine takes a photo with Mira and uses it to sell spit to strangers. When one asks to see her in person, she takes Mira on a shopping trip and pretends to be her courier. She hands the spit to her client, a juvenile lawyer. They run into Zack, but he walks past them.
Jasmine takes Mira home and laughs about the scam she pulled. The lawyer grabs her face and orders her to take back her spit. Zack approaches them both and reveals he saw everything that happened.

Summary
Jin Jang suspects that Eli will be in trouble because he hasn't fought in a while, and Jay was overprotected as a child. Jace thinks otherwise, believing that Jay and Eli are just hiding their strength. Eli has difficulty fighting the Park brothers because they are trained and he is a streetfighter, and Jay has the opposite problem. Jin reveals that he set up these matches so they would have no chance of winning.
Jace has faith that Eli will win his fight regardless of his weaknesses because Eli has determination and willpower. He will do anything for
Yenna
, and when he realizes he is late to pick her up he goes into savage mode. Jace is also unconcerned for Jay, believing that Jay still has one trick up his sleeve: the contents of his suitcase that nobody knows. With these words Jay pulls out a gun and aims a laser at Dominic's forehead.

Train perverts
Summary
The guys and girls are on the train to Cheongliang when the girls catch the eye of a small crew in Cheongliang, who are also a bunch of perverts. They want to approach the girls but cannot because they are sitting with
Daniel
and
Zack
. As they enjoy the ride Daniel realizes how much he missed not having to fight.
In another compartment
Jace
and
Vasco
are seated on the train, but in different compartments. They are on a mission to get information on Hostel's branch operation in Cheongliang. A girl comes to sit next to Jace and offers him candy. He tries to ignore her but he eventually falls for her.
The train perverts make their way over and begin harassing the gang, first by spilling Coca-Cola on Zack. He gets up to fight but is reprimanded by Daniel and decides not to. They are intimidated by Vasco, who tells them to fuck off. The perverts return to their leader Matt Kang and warn him of the gangster they just met (Vasco).
On a pit stop Vasco gets down to eat some sausage bars. He buys two for himself and Jace, but he took a lot of time and misses the train. Jace does not notice until his seatmate points it out. He tells Vasco to not to worry about the missed train, and that he will meet him at the destination they decided. Vasco yells at him to notice that the girl he is seated with has a tattoo of an 'h' on her wrist, and is therefore a member of Hostel.

Summary
Members of Hostel A muse about the girl with the 'h' tattoo.
Seth Lee
, the head of the Cheongliang branch has just been inducted into Hostel by beating Chuck Kwak. He asks if she is experienced and
Jasmine Huh
tells him that the girl will learn quickly because she is a runaway and desperate for a home. He wonders about the Cheongliang fam and is told that they will not interfere because they are just gangsters. They also tell him not to worry about
Burn Knuckles
, because there is no one smart enough to stop them.
Jace is talking to the girl with the tattoo and mentions that Hostel is in the region. He warns her to be careful, then tells her that she should keep the information secret, because no one knows it. A man in black is seated behind them and hears what they have said. It is revealed that the train perverts are headed to become a branch of Hostel in Cheongliang.
Since Vasco missed the train, the perverts decide to pursue the girls further. One of them smells
Joy's
hair, and in retaliation Zack decides to smell his hair. The man punches Zack and Daniel is concerned for him. He tells Daniel not to worry, that he won't fight because he doesn't want to ruin
Mira's
vacation. He makes Daniel promise to shave his hair if he fights. The perverts laugh and one of them hits Zack, but he takes it and decides to hold back.
Back on the train the boys see the girls being harassed by the gangsters. One of the perverts pours soda on Mira and uses it as an excuse to touch her thighs. Zack places his own thigh there and tells Daniel to get him a razor, as he intends to fight.

Jace is worried about Johan agreeing to fight for him because of he looks innocent and naive but soon he finds out that Johan is a vicious fighter, smashing people into the ground and stealing their shoes. He recalls that Johan never had a right-hand man compared to other gangs, and wonders what would happen to
Burn Knuckles
if Johan hadn't been betrayed by his gang.
Jace asks a Hostel member about where the girl is and is told she is at the tea house. He tells Johan and he decides to head over and beat everyone up. Jace protests that he needs a strategy, and when Johan refuses he reminds him that he is in charge. He comes up with a diversion plan: Johan will get information from inside Hostel and he will get the information externally. Johan is annoyed but agrees, and Jace is worried if impulsiveness will be a problem.

Summary
Jace tries to get Johan to calm down but the men snicker at him, causing him to snap and start attacking everyone. Jace gets the information from another Hostel member who tells him that the girl is actually at the gambling house. He is eager to tell Johan the news when he notices that Johan's hand was damaged from the fight. He remembers
Vasco
telling him a long time ago that he felt sorry for Johan because he was lonely. Jace offers Johan a bandage for his hands but Johan tosses it in the dirt, saying he doesn't need any help.
At
Jay's
beach house Zack is lighting a firecracker.
Zoe
complains and he throws a tantrum about being able to do it on his own. The sparks singe the clothes of the Cheongliang fam, who angrily ask them what they are going to do about burning their clothes. Daniel worries that they are going to finally get into a fight. Back at Hostel headquarters Seth Lee hears that Brett lost. Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak tell him not to worry because Jace is with Vasco, and Vasco is not as strong as Seth. They decide to meet them at the gambling house.
On the way there, Jace asks Johan how he managed to get so strong during his fights, and if he has any friends. Johan lists his dogs' names and asks Jace the same question. Jace mentions the Burn Knuckles and talks at length about Vasco and how he misses him. Johan becomes jealous of his admiration for Vasco and proceeds to show off his strength by beating the gatekeepers of the building, claiming that he is better than Vasco. Jace disagrees and calls his behavior childish. They argue until Jace is punched by Seth Lee, who asks if Johan is Vasco.
Jace is surprised at how powerful the shot was. Johan offers to help him up and Jace hands him the bandage, thinking that he, Johan and Vasco could have been good friends. He is attacked again by Seth, leaving Johan shocked. When Seth continues to confuse Johan for Vasco he puts on the bandage and copies Vasco's stance, saying he will show Seth what Vasco is really like.

Summary
Jace is confused as to how Johan will fight like Vasco. Seth is unimpressed by Johan and challenges him to a thumb war. He is known in his region as a thumb crusher with tremendous strength, and Johan looks fragile enough to break. However, Johan is stronger than Seth thinks, so Seth decides to fight him. Johan endures his hits and knocks him out, saying the only reason he doesn't fight like Vasco is that he doesn't his style. Jace realizes how much stronger Johan has become, and Johan commands Seth's underlings to help Jace up.
In the gambling house, the uncles are warned that Jace is on his way. They are unconcerned, as they just defeated the entire gambling house. They say that they can take anyone on with their skills, even if it is Vasco. As Jace and Johan make their way, Jace tries to warn Johan of the skills of the uncles. Johan isn't paying attention, causing Jace to be worried.
As they enter the building the men are frozen in their places, out of fear of Johan. He realizes how much he underestimated the reputation that Johan has built during his
God Dog
years. He walks the girl out of the room and into the arms of Jace. He thanks Johan and asks him to help beat up the duo, but he refuses because his contract is over. Jace wonders what Johan's true motives were as he disappears again.
The next day is the day of the meeting between the CEOs of HNH and H groups. As
the CEO of HNH group
makes his way down the road, Johan waits for him in an alley. He knows the CEO has the means to cure his mother, and Johan has all the money. He waits until the man approaches and greets him nervously.
The night before, Daniel and the others have made peace with the Cheongliang fam and they are sitting at a bonfire together. Zack mentions that their shades remind him of
Vin
, and the Cheongliang fam are suddenly alert. Elsewhere, Vin and
Mary
are reminiscing about the Cheongliang fam. Mary is excited to meet them, but Vin has a bad feeling. It is proven to be correct when the Cheongliang fam attack Daniel's friends.

Summary
The Cheongliang fam demand to know where Vin is, and Daniel clarifies that they are not friends. MC Pesticides is relieved to hear of it and lets go of Daniel, but MC Rice Bag continues to harass Zack. While watching them quarrel, Daniel tells MC Pesticides that his friend is in danger because Zack is a skilled boxer. He is unconcerned because his friend is also skilled, flipping Zack on his head. Zack rushes MC Rice Bag and lifts him up in an effort to prove his strength. They are both lifted by MC Pesticides, who tells Zack he will punish him. Daniel tells them to stop and then flips all three of them, surprising Jay.
MC Pesticides compares his strength to Mary, and wonders how Daniel can be so strong. Daniel is concerned that are outnumbered but then sees MC Pesticides running away, screaming about a monster. Then the remaining members of Cheongliang fam are flipped by Mary, the monster. She berates them for fighting, and when they ask if she came alone she reveals that she did not.
The next day, the two CEOs finally meet in Cheongliang. Jay's father compliments Crystal's father on how fast he is climbing up the ranks, and warns him not to get greedy. He implies that he suspects the other CEO is using children to collect money for him, and that he will expose him one day. Crystal's father realizes that the crew business is becoming dangerous for him, and is thinking of stopping it. He comes across Johan waiting for him in the alleyway.
He asks if Johan knows him and Johan stammers out his request. The CEO ignores him and turns to his men, telling them that this is the reason why the crew business was too messy and dangerous for him to continue. He tells
Goo
to take care of this mess and the latter kicks Johan's backpack, scattering his money all over the alley.
Goo tells Johan he cannot be seen with the CEO, and that he is naïve for trying to negotiate with him. Johan is enraged that Goo stepped on his money and orders him to pick him up. Goo is surprised that Johan would have the guts to challenge him, then notices that Johan's aura has changed and he looks deadlier than he used to.

Summary
Johan does not hesitate to attack Goo, hitting him with all he's got. Goo gets up but is knocked down again and again by Johan as he showcases skills from Vasco,
Jake
and
Gun
. Goo realizes how dangerous Johan has become when he copies Gun's punch. On his final blow Johan is shocked to see that he has missed Goo, and Goo quickly recovers. He is surprised to see that Johan missed his last shot because he looked so determined. Goo mentions that he initially wanted to be friends with Johan, but decided against it because Johan is a "momma's boy". He ends the battle by beating Johan unconscious with a stick.
Elsewhere Jace gives the hostel girl his number, and she asks him out to eat. He then spots Vasco coming towards him with the bear family he made on the road to Cheongliang. Vasco gives him the sausage bars, and proudly tells Jace of his trials getting to Cheongliang. Jace fills him in on what happened last night and Vasco apologizes for not being there, but he disagrees with Jace that Johan helped him out for the money. Instead he thinks that the reason Johan helped Jace that night was so he would have a friend for the night. As he leaves Johan in the alleyway, Goo says Johan may have a shot at beating Gun in the future.
Mary reveals that her companions are the middle school judo club who coincidentally all look the same. The men angrily ask where Vin is and she tells them that he ran back to Seoul, because he was afraid they might kill him. She asks about MC Pesticides and is told that he ran away because he was scared of her. She is a bit upset because she wanted to see him.
In the daytime MC Pesticides passes his test to join Hostel A by lifting a motorcycle with the uncles on it. He tells them he will bring the rest of Cheongliang fam along, and asks about the other uncle,
James Gong
. It turns out he is on vacation with Jasmine and the two of them stole
Olly's
bike. They are oblivious to the drama occurring within the Cheongliang branch.
In Korea's juvenile prison a rehablitation program is established by Hyunwoo Kim, a psychologist. He wants to prove that children can be changed for the better, but is disheartened when he sees the menacing looks of the inmates. He begins his evaluation with
Jiho Park
, who is there for attempted murder.

Summary
Riley Oh
is placed in
Darius
's cell after he was arrested for prostitution scams. He notices that nobody in the cell has eyebrows and is unnerved by it. Riley wants to appear tough, so he challenges Darius for dominance. Darius takes offense and decides to discipline Riley.
Mr. Kim
has begun his evaluations and is concerned about Riley, who is hysterical and begs him to save him from the cell leader. He questions Darius about his desires in an attempt to connect to him, but Darius tries to sexually harass him. Wally also proves to be unstable and tries to choke Mr. Kim on the orders of the cell leader. The only normal person is
Jiho
, who draws a cute picture of a house and says he likes Mr. Kim's fidget spinner. Mr. Kim takes the drawing to be a sign that Jiho craves affection, and tells Jiho that he is a good kid and shouldn't lose himself.
When Mr. Kim talks to the prison guards they say they cannot move Jiho from his cell. He is angry because he thinks Jiho will be harassed by Darius, who he thinks is the leader of the cell. The guards tell him that Jiho is the leader of the cell, and that he is not a nice kid. In his cell, Jiho is shown shaving the eyebrows of Riley and enjoying the terrified look on his face.
In the prison yard, the leaders of the cells are fighting each other for a position in
Big Deal
. Jason Yoon and Brad Lee recommend one fighter based on his strength, but that fighter is overwhelmed by a sneak attack from Jiho.
Jake
is pleased with Jiho's development but his underlings are not. Once Jake leaves, Jason attacks Jiho and tells him off for fighting dirty. Jiho doesn't care about fairness and says he can beat Jason as well. Jason challenges Jiho to beat him, and Jiho accepts.
Later in a woodshop Jiho appears behind Jason, who is cutting wood. He asks if Jiho plans to push him like he pushed Daniel. Jiho says that the only thing he regrets about pushing
Daniel
is that he did not get someone else to do it for him. At these words, Wally pushes Jason into the saw.

Summary
Jason Yoon is saved from the saw by the juvenile prison guards. Mr. Kim watches as Jiho and Wally are taken into custody. He tries to convince one of the guards that Jiho was not to blame for the incident, but the guard does not buy it. He shows Mr. Kim photographs of Jiho's victims as evidence of his sadistic personality. The guard believes Jiho is pretending to be kind until a decision to release him is made, but Mr. Kim insists that he is innocent because his picture showed an unconscious desire for warmth.
In the prison yard Jiho is being beaten by Brad Lee as revenge for his attack on Jason Yoon. Brad describes to Jiho that what makes Big Deal great is its idealism. He tells Jiho off for his cruelty, but Jiho insists that the only way he can win is to fight savagely. Jake takes Jiho's side and allows him into Big Deal, kicking out Jason because he lost. Brad is sad that Jake is changing, and wonders what to tell Jerry.
In the cafeteria Mr. Kim sits down with Jiho and asks him to turn himself in. He mentions that Jiho used to be different in high school, and tells him he can change. Jiho tells Mr. Kim that he has left his old self behind and knocks him out with his food tray. Guards swarm in and Brad thinks it is over for Jiho, but the inmates confess to his crime instead of Jiho. Brad sees the dangerous level of influence Jiho had on the inmates and is afraid that Jiho will lead to the destruction of Big Deal.
Cookies
Cookie 1 occurs directly after Jiho knocks out Mr. Kim. As he stands over his body, he places the fidget spinner in his mouth and smiles that he completed the picture. The picture that Mr. Kim thought was of a house was actually a picture of himself with the spinner in his mouth, foreshadowing the violence Jiho had towards the counselor.
Cookie 2 is Jiho standing after having beaten a number of inmates. He kept the fidget spinner from Mr. Kim and affirms that he doesn't need to be strong, he just needs to win.
Cookie 3 is the guards deciding who to release. They decide between Jiho or Jake

Eli and Olly continue their fight on the roof. Goo asks Gun in a different location why he favored Eli, and he mentions his reckless and wild behavior. As Olly and Eli are equally matched, Olly reflects on why he wanted to see Eli; because Eli is the first person who made him feel fear. Olly has had to pretend to feel emotions for most of his life do to his condition. But now he does not feel it, because Eli is stronger than him.
Warren, Max and Derrick and Sally appear and Olly beats them all except for Sally. He asks her why he is unable to feel anything, and tries to hit her but Warren protects her. Olly sees Heather in Sally and realizes that what he felt wasn't fear of Eli, but guilt for what he had done to Heather. He becomes overwhelmed with grief and jumps off the roof to kill himself.

Summary
A streamer, Jamie, has a bruise on her arm and the viewers quickly point it out to her. The viewers also comment on the lack of sleep she was getting, and the high amount of food she was eating. One streamer tells her to pick up a strawberry if she was kidnapped, and Jamie does so. Some of the viewers are skeptical, while others are concerned for her. Under the table, two grown men glare at her and urge to her behave. The introduction ends.
Amy
and
Natalie
apply to a job at MCN. They get the job quickly after
Samuel
, the CEO, sees that they do not have a background. He introduces them to the five most popular Kwitch streamers, which the two girls find strange.
At school,
Daniel
holds up the One MCN card that
Gun
had given him and observes it, wondering what he should do.
Doo Lee
walks up to him, fascinated. He says that he had been trying to get into streaming. He watched Doo Lee stream, but the viewers are not happy.
At home, Daniel tries it again in his old body, and instantly gets many people to watch him. He shows them what a loser he was in school, and the audience finds it relatable.
The next day, Daniel goes to MCN in his new body while carrying his old body in a suitcase. He has a brief encounter with Samuel, who confirms that he is a member of
Workers.

one of the streamers
blocking the doorway, the short one with an odd mouth. Daniel hides under the table with him as
Samuel
bursts into the room and then leaves.
Daniel decides to sign the contract since he didn’t get much information. Samuel gives the contract papers and the girls are eager to sign, but
the girl in the racoon outfit
snatches the papers and tells them to read beforehand so they are not scammed. After striking out some clauses, she hands back the papers and they sign.
Warren
brings some fried chicken for the girls but
Sally

Like What

They call for help and the girl in the racoon outfit tells them they should have read the contract more carefully, and to listen to the viewers requests or they will face consequences by the gangsters under their desk. Daniel wakes up in his own room to find he is locked, but when he calls for help he is hit on the back of the head with a baseball bat by gangsters. He passes out but remembers he brought his second body along as luggage.

he expects to be caught and that in case Warren should cause a ruckus. Daniel's small body frees the girls from their cells and they go to every imprisoned streamer to save them. On his way out he runs into Mr. Gold, who instead of helping him, punches him the face. He takes off his wig and smirk and reveals that he is the president of the company, and he wanted to keep an eye on Daniel from the start. He wonders where Daniel got a black badge, since he asked the VVIPs and none of them confirmed. He asks if Daniel is conspiring with
Samuel
behind his back, and brings the security back to round up the streamers.
Warren and Doo are brought to the president and he berates the security team again on their mishaps. He beats up Samuel and tells him he should be grateful for all he has done. Daniel shows up holding the beaten security guards and greets everyone before informing them that they are disqualified for illegal actions. The president asks how Daniel can prove the illegal matters. Daniel throws the illegal contracts in the president's face, and tells him that the Workers are disqualified from the four crews. He managed to get these files by using his black badge on the locked safe.

Alexander tries to encourage Samuel to fight like his gangster father, and Jake mentions how he hates his father, who is also a gangster.
Amidst the fight the Black Bear crew pull up, and order the students to stop fighting. Most of the kids flee, except Jake's friends and Samuel and Alexander. The crew asks who they are, and they say they are from Big Deal, in an effort to appear tough.

Summary
Sinu blackmails the leader with a Newtube video he made, explaining that he will save the kids captured by Black Bear. If Sinu doesn't return, the video will be uploaded and they will gain a reputation as child killers. When they escape from their territory, Jake and the others learn Sinu was posturing the entire time. He invites them to come eat with him.
Alexander begins bragging that Samuel is the son of a gangster, and Jerry blurts out that Jake's father was also a gangster. Then he asks why Sinu is protecting this particular street, and he tells him the girls who work there are really pretty. Jake is angered by this and dumps his food before leaving. He remembers that his father used to cheat on his mother, and he is disappointed Sinu is like that. Samuel doesn't seem to mind, remembering that his father would say similar things.
As Jake sits down to think, he is approached by one of storeowners, a girl called Yeonhui. She tells Jake that he is wrong about Sinu, and that he was only joking. Sinu has been protecting her street ever since he was a child, and he usurped the previous owner so he would have the manpower to continue doing so. The people on the street came to know of him as the "Boy of Promise", and they pay him a fee out of their own gratitude. Jake decided to visit Big Deal once more, and along with Samuel, they became members.
On a rainy day, Jerry was walking back from school. He came across Johan Seong passed out in the floor, and recognizes him from the news.

He feels that Samuel is not being a good leader, but Old Face disagrees. When Samuel comes to the clothing store, he notices that the girls are distracted. He finds them surrounding Johan, who was brought in by Jerry Kwon after he decided to make him a member of Big Deal. Samuel tells Jerry they don't have money for new members, but Jerry insists that he will let him stay until Jake complains. Johan tearfully decides to leave, and the girls complain at Samuel, saying Johan is only trying to take care of his mother. Samuel tells Johan that he needs to toughen up if he is going to survive, and he recommends stealing shoes to make quick money. Sinu gives Johan some money on the way out, and Jerry wonders if he will see him again.
Meanwhile, Jake is accosted by Olly Wang, who is eager to join Big Deal. Jake asks Olly why he wants to join, seeing as he isn't from a poor family. Heather apologizes for him and berates Olly for joining. Jake tells Olly he might let him join some other day, as he reminds him of himself.
The Big Deal members decide to have some fun on the beach. Samuel asks Jake how long he plans to stay in Big Deal, as Sinu is going to retire soon. He plans to head to Gangnam later, because Big Deal is too idealistic and small to suit him. He asks Jake to come with him, but he refuses. He says the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it wasn't like the other gangs. He resented his father for not caring about his family. Samuel is curious to know who his father is, and he tells him it is Gapryong Kim. Samuel's cigar slips out of his finger, because that is the name of the man he suspects is his father.
Late at night, Goo barges into Big Deal's store, asking if Sinu would like to join one of his four major crews. Gun is annoyed by his loudness, and Sinu is shocked and worried to see Goo.

Summary
Goo attempts to introduce himself, but Sinu hits him and tells the others to get back, because he is much stronger than him. Goo begins fighting Sinu, but Sinu's punches are actually doing damage. Big Deal are surprised to see Sinu fighting this hard. Sinu heard from other gangs that they have been defeated by Goo as a test, and his friend Jagalchi told him that he needs to be prepared for this. Sinu tries his best, and Gun feels as though he might be able to beat Goo. Goo takes the chopsticks Sinu was eating with and sharpens them into a weapon, which he begins slashing him with. As Sinu is being beaten, Goo tries to stab him, but Jake catches his hand with the chopsticks. Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.

Gun tells Big Deal that they made the cut, and he expects a 100 million won by the end of the month. The leaders of the gang sit down to discuss their prospects. Old Face proposes using the girls to make a profit, and Jason adamantly opposes it. Jake gets up to leave the meeting, saying they shouldn't make a decision without Sinu present. Samuel also disagrees, saying he will find a way to make the money himself.
When Jake goes to meet Samuel, he is standing by the lighthouse. Jake asks how he plans on making the 100 million won. Samuel tells him to get lost, because he can't stand seeing Gapryong's son. He is jealous of Jake, but he isn't aware of why.
Later, Goo and Gun come to a warehouse to collect their dues. Jake and his crew attempt to stop them, but Goo notices that they have the money needed. Samuel tells Goo that the money is ready to be collected, and kicks it before he can count it. He tells Goo that he has to test him before he can hand him the money. Black Bear gang are upset that Gun and Goo are trying to take down their enemies, and have decided to step in to assert their dominance.

Summary
Samuel has a flashback to when he asked the Black Bear gang to help him. He used the stores as collateral to ask for a loan of the Black Bear gang: they would pay the stores, and in return the gang would help them defeat Goo and Gun. However, he bet that Gun and Goo would defeat them, and in return he would not have to pay a cent. Gun is impressed by his foresight and wants to congratulate him, but Samuel gives Old Face the credit of the plan. Jake is disgusted by Samuel and decides to leave, reminded of his own father. The Black Bear gang eventually goes out of business.
Goo heads to a house in a neighborhood, where he finds Charles Choi sitting on the ground with a few others. He greets the workers head, who has just managed to make a name for his gang. There is also another person in the room: James Lee, one of the ten geniuses.

Summary
Samuel takes control of Big Deal, and orders one of his members to refuse the girls food unless they reach their quota. He asks if the others will listen to someone other than Jake, and Samuel beats him in a rage. He discusses his decision with Old Face, who agrees happily with the decision. Sinu pulls up on them and punches Old Face. He asks why Samuel has gone from being ambitious to leading with cruelty. Samuel reminds Sinu of his favoritism towards Jake, and tells him he isn't needed in Big Deal anymore. Jason and Brad prepare to leave Big Deal, but Jerry refuses to leave until Jake returns.
Sinu meets Jake at the lighthouse and tells him he has a plan to beat Gun, but Jake is skeptical. Sinu asks if he is hesitant to fight because of his father. Jake tells him he is correct, that he is trying to avoid the drama. Sinu tells him he doesn't have to join Big Deal, but he would like him to at least protect the storeowners, since he isn't strong enough to. Jake comes back to his mother's house and asks what kind of father he was. His mother confirms that he was a piece of shit, but would do his best to help those less fortunate than himself.
Jake comes back to Big Deal to find Samuel beating Jerry, who is trying to protect the girls. He tells Samuel he has never decided who the leader is, and while he dislikes fighting for passion, that he will do so regardless. Gun is sitting on a bench to watch the fight.

Summary
Samuel has a flashback to when he first learned about his father. He created Gangseo Union so he could become a gangster like Gapryong Kim. He would follow him to his campaigns and protect him from civilians who harassed him and were angry about his crimes. Samuel's hope was to become prominent enough to be able to approach Gapryong. When he came back from seeing Gapryong for the first time, his mother showed him his real father, an tradesman who abandoned his family a long time ago. The picture he cherished of Gapryong was taken by his real father during an outing with his mother. Gapryong also has a vasectomy, so he couldn't have children after Jake.
Samuel was so enraged he tried to choke his father. He made himself believe Gapryong was his father, because the alternative was too painful to bear. He never did get to meet Gapryong, and he is angry that Jake has the life he dreamed of. However, his emotions make Samuel unstable in the fight, and he ends up losing to Jake. Gun congratulates Jake on his victory. Sinu arrives at that moment to show Jake how to defeat Gun.

Summary
Sinu folds and reveals that there isn't a way to beat Gun; he and Jake should just surrender. Jake is livid and tells Sinu to give him the secret, but he tells him to wait. Gun has given him a card to contact the Workers, saying that if he cannot deal with the crew, it is best he sell it. He tells his plan to Old Face, and he asks the members of Big Deal to join him. Most of them do, but Jason and a few others refuse to leave Big Deal. He calls Jerry and tells him to take care of Gangdong, so he isn't present for the selling of Big Deal. Yeonhui overhears him and realizes that Sinu doesn't plan on selling Big Deal, but selling himself. Old Face and his crew decide to take down Jake on the orders of Sinu. He and the YB crew defeat them, and Jake hurries to stop Sinu from selling the crew.

Summary
Jake doesn't believe that Sinu would sell Big Deal to the Workers, but he doesn't see through the lie yet. He tries to beat Sinu into shape, but he is too easy on Sinu. He beats him proper and tells him that he did sell the crew, for 100 million won. The leader of the workers actually decided to rate him 1 billion won, for his prowess against Goo. Sinu asked to raise it to 1.2 billion won, to last them one year. Sinu continues to egg Jake on, even saying that he doesn't need the girls because Gangnam girls are more attractive. Jake tries his best now, but he is still too weak, and is knocked out by Sinu.
Sinu gives Jake his jacket, and makes his way to the Workers. Their leader tells Sinu that he will now be considered property, and no longer allowed to contact anyone. He is now No. 8 in the Workers, and his office is a giant cage.

Summary
Jake is preparing to leave Big Deal when Yeonhui gives him a recording Sinu made and never uploaded. Jake learned about the plan to gain enough money, and that Sinu expects him to defeat Gun and Goo in his place. At the monthly deposit, Gun asks Jake if he will be able to buy Sinu back, given his cost of $5 billion won. Jake tells him to be quieter, because nobody knows of this except himself and the storeowners. The storeowners offer to help buy Sinu, but Jake refuses because they are like family to Sinu. Jake hears about a gambling scheme being held in Seoul, and he begrudgingly decides to accept the position.
Samuel is also trying to get stronger to defeat Jake. He begs Gun to give him a second chance to be his successor, and Gun tells him to make a name for himself with his Gangseo Union. Samuel decides to weed out his weaker members by beating them, hoping that Gun would be impressed by his smaller, stronger team. Gun is disgusted by his actions and beats Samuel, telling him that he still hasn't learned why he was disqualified in the first place. The Gangseo Union abandon Samuel, and he is confused as to why he wasn't accepted.
Samuel hunts down Johan to ask him why he wasn't accepted, but Johan tells him to get lost. Jake and Olly also arrive, and both are surprised to see Samuel there. Apparently Gun summoned the crew leaders to see who is the strongest of them all.

Summary
Gun and Goo make a bet for 10 billion won on who will win. Gun bets on Gapryong's son, who is incredibly strong, and Goo bets on Olly Wang, who cannot feel pain. Johan attacks Jake first, and he is surprised that Johan is the same kid who came to Big Deal. Jake tells Johan that he is too kind to join a gang, and he should return home. Johan asks Jake to bet that whoever loses gives their territory to the winner of the fight. Olly quickly dispatches of Samuel and tries to beat the other two, but they ignore him and fight each other.
Samuel is wondering why he lost so hard. Everyone he looked down upon is stronger than him; Johan who was a crybaby, Olly who was a loser, and Jake who he thought was beneath him. Goo goes to take a picture to show Gun who won the fight, and the scene he sees shocks him. Samuel has already beaten Johan and Jake, and he strangles Olly until he passes out. Goo asks why Samuel wants to Gun to approve of him so badly. He already approves of Samuel, and asks that he become his new secret friend.

Summary
Jake's friends begin asking about the numbers racket, and Jake refuses to tell him. He is losing money quickly, and the head of the scam slaps him and asks if he wants them to fail. He tells Jake that making money isn't easy, and he has to sacrifice something to get what he wants. Jake remembers Gun's offer to earn money by becoming his successor, and swallows his pride, deciding to continue the gambling scheme. Even though he sees the pain of the people getting scammed, he decides it is worth it if he can rescue Sinu and save Big Deal.
When Vasco came to demand Jiho's money, Jake was reminded of himself. However, even his attempts to earn money were shut down when Gun disqualified himself. Jake recalls all of this as he wakes up in present time. He commanded Lineman to bring every member of Big Deal so they can attack the Workers, and force Gun to show himself to them.

Summary
Samuel Seo, now promoted to the rank of President of the Fourth Affiliate of Workers, stops Jake and the rest of Big Deal as they are headed to confront Workers. The current generation of Big Deal members reveal that he is still renown for outsmarted Gun and Goo back when he was still a member. Samuel and Jake engage in witty banter as Samuel suggests they abandon their ideology of passion and join Workers and tells Jake to start working smarter rather than harder. The two continue to converse casually as they engage in a violent exchange of fists. Samuel claims that it is ridiculous to even consider attacking Workers, as that will only help Gun. He then asserts that the Big Four Crews were created as a means to an end, simply to provide the funds for someone's business. Now that someone wants the crews to disappear as they have begun to attract too much attention to themselves, mostly due to Daniel's movements against the crews. Samuel postulates that Gun has received an order to wipe out the crews, especially Workers, since they are aware of the only weakness of "that mysterious person", presumably Charles Choi. Samuel Seo then offers an alliance with Big Deal. Jake then moves towards the car, asserting that he should finally be able to meet the elusive head of Workers if he is here to form an alliance, and the shadowed face of the head is revealed within the car as Jake Kim peers through the open window.
Daniel Park is doing better for himself as he has continued to stream with Kwitch. His self-esteem is higher and his living conditions have improved. As he is streaming within his home, he absentmindedly asks his viewers if they have heard anything about the four major something, eluding to the Big Four Crews. As he ponders when he will finally get rid of the crews, the Chairman of H Group, Jay's dad, and his subordinates approach his neighborhood.

Summary
Jake Kim announces to Big Deal that he is forming an alliance with the Workers. He tells them that they need to ally with the Workers in order to defeat Gun, but he hides the fact that Sinu did not betray Big Deal. He changes into a new outfit to infiltrate the Workers by himself.
Daniel tells Steve Hong that Gun and Goo are the two responsible for forming the four major crews, and that the four crews are comprised of minors. Hong offers Daniel an alliance to defeat the crews by offering him money, but Daniel is skeptical and refuses him. Then Hong offers him the chance to change his life, and the location of the third affiliate: Club Vivi. Daniel dresses up using Jay's clothing to enter the club, but he is rejected due to his looks. As he sits with the other rejected members of the club, they see Xialong carrying Vivi into the club, with the guards bowing before them. Daniel recognizes that the guards are wearing gold badges of the Workers. He returns to tell Hong that he was blocked from entering due to discrimination. Hong tells Sophia to make Daniel lose 90lbs by any means possible.
Tom Lee enters a bar to speak with the chairman of Workers, who is calling from a cell phone elsewhere. The chairman tells him to send his men back to the Workers, and Tom says his company only works for payment, mentioning Choi's offer of a new building. The chairman offers him even more money than Choi, so Tom decides to send an intern (Johan Seong) to the third affiliate.

DJ Chaerin notices the fight breaking out with Vasco and Ho Hwang, but decide to just crank the music because the people are enjoying it. Old Face interrupts them and tells the guards he will handle the situation, and Jake is annoyed he missed his chance to talk to him. Jake suspects that Vasco doesn't stand a chance against Old Face, but Vasco has gotten stronger and easily knocks him out. Ho Hwang congratulates Vasco's strength.
Jake takes Old Face to a bathroom and ties him up. He sticks a toilet paper roll in his mouth and threatens to pump water down his throat if he doesn't reveal Sinu Han's location. Old Face tells him that he doesn't know where Sinu is, but he knows something else thats valuable. The girl in the stroller from earlier is Vivi, the president of the third affiliate and the daughter of a Chinese billionaire. She runs Hotel Vivi and Club Vivi. She is currently in the Workers because she is a drug addict, and drugs laws are more harsh in China. Old Face also tells Jake that her bodyguard is called Xiaolong, and his loyalty and the guards' loyalty is towarsd Vivi above all else. Xiaolong is rumored to be as strong as Gun, and the other bodyguards are as strong as the crew heads. Jake decides not to interfere with Vasco's fight, because he is not strong enough to lead a crew.
Vasco is currently losing against Ho Hwang when he tells him that he has learned a lot about winning from bad guys: he has to use his most lethal move first. He grabs Hwang's face and uses two of Brekdak's forbidden moves: No. 7 (Dough Kneading) and No. 8 (Rice Bag Smash). Jake approaches Xiaolong guarding a door and asks if he can speak with him in English, knowing that Xiaolong only speaks Chinese, and will probably only fight him.

Summary
Xiaolong responds to Jake in Korean asking if he would step inside, and he is dissapointed he didn't get a chance to fight. When he enters the room a chicken foot is thrown at the wall by Vivi, who is angry that Xiaolong sent an unattractive guard to her. Jake realizes that they mistook him for someone else and decides to play the role, introducing himself as a member of the White Tiger Company. He fakes details about Tom Lee's life and says he thought he would have met Sinu Han during his interview, saying that the two of them are lovers. Xiaolong mentions that he is No. 8, and Vivi tells Jake that their love was not meant to be given that the numbers are kept secret. Jake tries sneezing his name and playing a song about Sinu, but they are interrupted when Johan arrives and introduces himself as the intern from White Tiger Company.
Vasco continues to fight the guards, breaking one of their legs with Brekdak's Forbidden Move No. 6. Johan recognizes Jake, and he attempts to leave but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar. Brekdak enters the club wondering what is taking Vasco so long.

Summary
Brekdak asks Alexander Hwang, who is now working as a valet at the third affiliate, to step aside. Other Workers members ask what is going on, and he explains that Brekdak is looking for someone. They tell Hwang they were going to report him for running a food truck without a liscence, and Brekdak backs off to save his business.
Jake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer and find more information about Sinu. Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen.
The two of them confront Vasco, and he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo. The three of them decide to fight each other.

Summary
Xiaolong reveals that he gave this test to Johan and Jake believing they would lose to Vasco. He does not trust the White Tiger Company, because the
chairman of the Workers
is using them to spy on the third affiliate, and he does not want any of his men in the club. Johan is fighting well using his taekwondo. Jake remembers a time he and
Jason Yoon
ate together, and Jason mentioning wanting to fight a powerful taekwondo fighter from Gangbuk, a guy whose moves resemble Johan's. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.
Johan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them, disappearing into an underground passage.
Steve Hong is impressed by Daniel's weight loss, and Sophia cries tears of joy now that Daniel has lost enough weight to go undercover.

Summary
Daniel has lost a lot of weight since training with
Sophia
and he is starting to see positive results. As he is stepping out of the house he smells soap in the air, and a girl his age passes by.
Doo Lee and Alexander Hwang are getting yelled at for talking too much while working. Doo was taken from the fourth affiliate to work in the third affiliate's cleanup crew. Alexander was sent to the third affiliate to do odd jobs after being taken by
Tom Lee
. Daniel runs into them crying on the road and decides to buy them some fried chicken. He is reminded of
Like What
and
Hilarious
and sees one of the waitresses being harassed by her boss. Daniel intercepts the boss as he tries to grab the girl, and the boss moves away. He tells the girl she should try making money in other avenues, and that he knows a guy (himself) who made it large using TikTacTok.
Johan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers. Daniel hands Jake his ID, which says he is 90 years old. Jake tells Daniel minors aren't allowed inside, and Daniel reveals his black VVIP badge.

Summary
Jake believes Daniel must know something about
Sinu Han
since he is a VVIP. He tries to send a signal by sneezing, and Daniel doesn't understand but tries to send his own signals asking about drugs and secrets of the third affiliate.
Vivi's friends Antonio, Michael and Jonathan ask her why she is working in the club, and she tells them about how difficult it is to sell and use drugs in China compared to Korea. They ask her about her other drug business, Pungsan. Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
Jake and Daniel are finding it difficult to tease information out of each other. Jake gives up and asks Daniel to ask the president about Sinu Han if he sees them, because Sinu is his long lost brother. Daniel says he will, and they go to ask Xiaolong to see the president since he is a VVIP. Vivi and her friends are high in a room lined with mushrooms, so Xiaolong denies them. Daniel says he'll report this to the Workers and Xiaolong grabs him by the neck, saying he doesn't care if Daniel is a VVIP or not, he can always go back to China. Daniel escapes the choke and asks Xiaolong if there are drugs inside that room.

Summary
Xiaolong considers killing Daniel, and that it would bring a lot of trouble. He eventually lets Daniel and Jake inside the room, which is now completely empty. They search but they don't find any trace of drugs or Sinu. Daniel suspects a secret room is inside there. Alexander Hwang tells him that Vivi only meets with the super rich and influential, so it will be difficult to talk with her. He asks why Daniel is acting poor when he can pay with his black badge. Daniel starts paying for everyone's drinks and the club starts getting wild.
Johan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him. All of the expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol asks Daniel to come to the president. He comes to a room with several influencers sitting around sweets, along with TikTacTok girl. He eats some of the cookies and asks them where the drugs are, and they tell him that he just ate the drugs: Vivi bakes them into cookies called "Vivi cookies". Daniel faints and wakes up in his second body that he rushes into the club with.

Summary
TikTacTok girl tries help Daniel but everyone around her is drunk. Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and orders her to get wasted as well. Daniel enters the room to find it's emptied out. Xiaolong tells Daniel he was expecting him to attack the third affiliate, and Jake knocks him out despite taking a heavy blow from Daniel.
Daniel wakes up in a hotel room where Vivi asks if he's okay. He asks why she cares about him and she tells him her dad said to befriend any billionaire's kid, so she can make friends. When he asks about TikTacTok girl Vivi says if he likes her he can be a part of the treasure hunt she set up with her friends. These rich kids invite influencers they fancy so they can assault them while they are unconscious. Daniel beats the guys and raises his fist at Vivi in anger when Taegon Wi, another Workers executive, throws a kunai at him. The other kids' guards rush in to say that Daniel isn't the son of a billionaire, but an unknown person. Daniel says the third affiliate is rejected from the four crews.

Summary
Taegon Wi, also known as "King Gon", had fought with
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
before. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it. He chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.
Jake tells Daniel that he is in the VIP room where they grow hallucinogenic mushrooms, what he suspects is the third affiliate's illegal activity. He also tells Daniel that he found out the secret of the room while Alexander was flipping tables: that the room itself rotates. Daniel tells Jake that in the rooms above the club influencers are drugged and taken advantage of. He begs Jake to save them and Jake says he doesn't care, he is only interested in finding Sinu. He switches off with Johan as bouncer but starts to remember Daniel's words. He calls Big Deal and asks them to send two people over, knowing Sinu would have probably wanted that. Jake and Lineman show up to the club.

Summary
Xiaolong is informed about the intruders, who are fighting executives. He tells the guard to tell the executives they can kill any intruder. He locks Vivi in her room and guards the outside.
Taegon Wi grew up without a family in China. He was targeted by kidnappers as a kid, and he did whatever he could to survive. When he became older he was approached by Xiaolong who offered him a position. Although he has been in Korea for some time, he hasn’t found any opponents as strong as those in China.
Taegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli’s baton away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.
Lineman is still standing after taking a beating from Huseong. Huseong asks why his tattoos aren’t colored in, because it looks amateur. Lineman says he can’t color them because Jake called him Lineman. Huseong decides to end things when Jerry comes out of the bathroom. Lineman asks Jerry if his act was worthy of Big Deal before passing out.

Summary
Huseong Ha was abandoned at a zoo when he was a newborn. A male gorilla decided to raise him, and he treated it like his mother. The authorities took Huseong out and he entered society, but he was always curious about why humans are weak. He joined the army and later founded the Gorilla gang. Later on, his gang was sold to the Bicheon gang by the authorities. Xiaolong approached him at dinner and asked him to help protect someone.
Huseong asks Jerry if he is trying so hard because Jake is watching him. Jake offers to get the badge for Jerry but he tells Jake to take Lineman and Daniel and leave. Once they are gone, Jerry punches Huseong into the wall, and his head breaks a hole into it. Huseong realizes Jerry was hiding his strength to not outshine Jake. Lineman returns and sees the wreckage, and Jerry tells him not to reveal that he is stronger than Jake. Vasco comes across Hwang Ho and uses Brekdak’s 7th forbidden move, dough kneading. Hwang sees it coming and blocks the attack.
Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he’s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn’t need help, since Johan is reliable enough. Samuel offers to help out if Xiaolong barks like a dog.

Summary
Jake takes Daniel and Tiktaktok girl to a room so they can pretend to be guests, warning them not to leave. Daniel asks the girl to go to sleep, and he tries to turn into his other body but it won’t wake up. Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.
The disfigured men attack Eli and he is surprised how little they care about being damaged. They even injure each other trying to kill him. Elsewhere, Vasco tries to get the badge from Hwang but the henchmen grab him. They are doused with gasoline, and they light a match while holding Vasco. The three musketeers are climbing the elevator when they arrive at a floor filled with the disfigured henchmen. They are even on top of the elevator.
Samuel explains that during the Great Chinese Fire, 103 children were burned. Xiaolong took them in and turned them into warriors to protect Vivi. They are part of the Bicheon gang (Bi meaning queen, Cheon meaning sky and heaven). Samuel doesn’t think they are as strong as Big Deal however. Jake, Jerry and Lineman mow down the men and arrive at Vivi’s room.

Summary
Vasco managed to avoid being burned, and the fire alarms have been turned on. In the wet, Vasco, Eli and Big Deal try to fend off the Bicheon gang, but they keep rising back up. Jerry grabs Lineman by the head and clears a path for Jake. Lineman pulls down a grate to block the horde.
The three of them face Xiaolong. Vivi breaks open the door and yells at Xiaolong for locking her inside, but he tells her to stay there and closes the door again, locking it with his spear. He tells Jake he will have to kill him if he wants to enter the door. Jake tells Xiaolong he isn’t protecting Vivi simply out of loyalty, and the flashback begins.
Xiaolong was among 108 unregistered Chinese children. He participated in a brutal match where he had to slaughter his fellow brothers in order to be recognized by Vivi’s father. He took him in as a guard to watch over Vivi. Xiaolong throws away Lineman and knocks Jerry into the ground.
Xiaolong says that Big Deal have already failed since their reinforcements are coming (Johan). Johan makes his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he’s working with the third affiliate when they’re responsible for the Punsang cult.

Summary
Xiaolong recalls when he sent Taegon Wi to monitor Jake Kim, going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well. He is shocked to see how powerful Jake was. Gun hears people comparing him to Xiaolong and says he would have to fight him in order to see how strong he truly is.
Jake tells Xiaolong that he’s going to take Vivi to get information about the Workers No.8, Sinu Han. Jake runs towards Vivi’s room and Xiaolong races after him. Jake throws the spear at Xiaolong, and when he’s dodging he grabs his head and slams him into the ground. With Xialong incapacitated, he walks to Vivi’s door.
Xiaolong recalls being promoted to Cheon No.1 by the current master Jiou Jeon. He is taught Cheon Hohuigong, a martial art that is passed down to the Cheon guards. It’s about making the body into a weapon. Xiaolong declines the offer to protect the chairman because he wants to protect Vivi. Gun continues his narration by saying he would have had to fight Xiaolong because he doesn’t know how he would fare against his martial art. In present day Xiaolong rises again to fight.
Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.

Hwang Ho recalls meeting with his peers: Huseong Ha of Gorilla gang, King Gon Taegon Wi, Hongwol Sowol Jin and Hwang Ho. Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest by fighting, and Hwang decided to challenge him. When Hwang asked why they were fighting, Taegon said because he is obviously the strongest of the four.
Hwang Ho decides he will go full force for Vasco, and Vasco warns him that people die from Brekdak’s five most powerful skills. They prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away. Daniel starts climbing outside the hotel so he can get to the penthouse.
Eli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan says to give the badge or else he will kill him.

Summary
Gun is asked how strong Eli is compared to the others. He says Eli could have been strong if he continued fighting, but he took a three year break. Without doing any training in that time, the others would have surely surpassed him. However, Eli has been doing some training. When Tom Lee found out Eli had a daughter, he kidnapped her. He kept her away from Eli until Eli regained his animal instincts: namely, being sneaky with stronger opponents. In one month he managed to win back Yenna from Tom.
Johan throws Eli’s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna’s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.
Jerry and Lineman wake up and are shocked to see Jake scarred from his fight. Jake tells Xiaolong he didn’t want to get serious, because he was losing his mind thinking about revenge. He’s willing to drop the facade for Xiaolong and pretend that he is Gun.

Summary
Zack
asked for a favor from
Namsoo
to look for a Limited Edition Jordans Shoes from the Craigslist. Having no idea on how much it costs, he only gave Namsoo $300. Namsoo had no choice but to find it despite the fact that it is almost impossible to get it with that price because he did not have the courage to tell Zack. Namsoo, who has almost given up, found a person who agreed to sell him the shoes for that price who, through the profile picture, appears to be a beautiful lady. The two agreed to meet the following day at Gian Station.
The next day at school, Namsoo informed Zack that he had found the shoes. Namsoo insisted on taking the shoes himself although Zack wanted to take it himself, saying that he is experienced enough to spot the product's authenticity (although this is actually because he wanted to meet the girl).
Right after Namsoo met the girl, he was startled with the presence of another two men who threatened to beat him up if he failed to pretend that they all are friends. He then realized that the girl was part of the scamming scene because she looked calm despite the situation. They all went to a quite, dead end, alley, and met the girl's boyfriend who presumably is the leader of the gang.
Haeri
(the girl) revealed that Namsoo had been chatting with her boyfriend Woojin, a thief from Gian High.
Woojin
took all the money and almost left when Namsoo suddenly stopped him and begged for mercy, stating that it is not his money, but his friend's who is a boxer. Feeling insulted by thinking it was a threat, Woojin beat Namsoo up.

Summary
The juvenile detention guards are chatting about their worst inmates when one of them brings up Gun Park. He used to fight the most violent inmates every day, staining the walls with their blood. Jake Kim surpassed him though, making the bloodstains even higher.
Xiaolong gets beat into another flashback. He remembers Vivi giving him his name Xiaolong, meaning “Little Dragon”. Vivi wanted to befriend Xiaolong, but he never had time for her because he didn’t want to indulge in her feelings. She even confessed to him but he apologized and said he didn’t deserve her. Xiaolong eventually became a eunuch so he could protect Vivi without her father’s suspicion.
Jake breaks Xiaolong’s two arms, and he tries to attack with his mouth. Jake grabs hold of Xiaolong and warns him that if he continues, he may never walk again. Xiaolong says he never intended to walk away from this battle, and Jake breaks his legs.
Jake opens the door for Vivi and tells her they are leaving. Vivi says that she isn’t leaving without Xiaolong and she sees him broken on the ground. Xiaolong crawls to Vivi and she runs to embrace him. Vivi and Xiaolong cry together, and he barks like a dog. Samuel hears him and smirks.

Summary
Daniel gets to the penthouse and releases the tied up influencers. They tell him there’s one more guy locked in another room, and he goes to investigate.
Xiaolong tells Samuel he will do whatever he wants if he protects Vivi. Samuel says he doesn’t want to. He was ordered by Eugene to help him break up the third affiliate’s current leadership, since they’re causing trouble. He wanted to make use of Vivi’s relationship with her father, but the leader of T Company refused to do business with them. If Samuel can bring Vivi to Eugene, he will be able to run the third affiliate.
Samuel mocks Xiaolong and tells Jake they are allies now. Jake asks what he is going to do with Vivi, because he needs her to tell him where Sinu is. Samuel says he will tell him about Sinu later but Jake doesn’t trust him, and they start fighting. As they are fighting, Daniel is thrown out between them. He warns them to run. The lights start flickering and influencers run away screaming. Daniel’s second body appears in ultra instinct form.

Summary
Samuel takes Jake to the basement, where there is a lit room with a stage and multiple bleachers. Sinu used to fight here in the Workers’ underground fighting ring. He and other prisoners were treated like animals and had to fight year long under grueling conditions. Samuel used to talk to Sinu during his breaks, but Sinu only remembered Jake and how he would save him. Samuel wondered if it was a side effect of the drugs he was taking. He would give him a pen to write with so he could have some amount of freedom, and Sinu would write on the walls. He filled the walls and the floor with the names of the Big Deal members so he wouldn't forget. Jake demands Samuel tell him where SInu is captured. He tells Jake that Sinu was moved to a bigger stadium, and that he brought him to this room to have a private place to speak. Samuel also says he will help him find Sinu if Jake helps him become king.
Daniel returns home and is upset that he didn’t do much, but happy that everyone is safe. He managed to steal some of Vivi’s cookies, so he plans on giving it to Steve Hong. He bumps into DG and drops the cookie, which the latter picks up and says he will be confiscating.

. DG eventually decides to give the cookies back to Daniel because he intends to meet
Steve Hong
himself. He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know. Daniel returns the cookies to Steve Hong, who is disappointed. Steve tells him that he won't reveal this to the public, because
Vivi
is the daughter of the chairman of T Group. He tells Daniel not to waste his money, because he will need it for the second affiliate.
Vivi and
Xiaolong
are living in rural China where
Goo
dropped them off. Vivi tells Xiaolong that if they keep a low profile, eventually her father will approve of their relationship. They say they love each other, and Xiaolong asks for Vivi to fetch him a blanket. Waiting for him is one of T Group's Cheon guards, Jiou Jeon, who takes Xiaolong away while stating there is no way for the two of them to be together. Vivi returns to find him gone.

Yui suggested the idea for Zack to try ordering from them again, this time with his own phone, telling them that although it's a fake phone, they will most probably will still be using it for a while due to the high cost. She also told Zack to change his profile picture into someone else who looked like a pushover, and they all decided on using
Jiho's
picture. Zack decided he would go and confront the thieves alone, but was surprised when
Daniel
volunteered after prodding from Zack's lackeys. The five of them begin to leave. Yui grabs Namsoo and says they should go as well;

Summary
Samuel
and
Eli
are grappling. Eli asks Samuel why he is holding back, and Samuel asks Eli what he wants. The chart he was looking at earlier with
Jin Jang
was the chart of crew heads he had to get on his side.
Jake
tells
Vasco
that he shouldn't change and become a bad guy, and Vasco rejects this notion, preparing to slam him with elbows.
Eugene
tells
Mandeok
to test
Daniel
, but
Zack
interrupts and starts monologuing about how he loses despite trying his best. Mandeok punches him but Zack gets up as though nothing happened, saying it is comical how often he fights without winning. He then does an instinctual spin that Daniel recognizes from his ultra instinct mode. Zack tells Mandeok the reason he keeps losing is because he tried to get rid of negative emotions, when he should have gotten rid of all emotion entirely. Eugene tells Mandeok to ask his name, and Zack introduces himself as a wimp. Daniel takes the chance to lunge at Eugene, but
the guy in the cap
stops him. Daniel senses that he is the strongest one there.

Mandeok
and
the guy in the cap
for protecting him like
Gun
and
Goo
have protected Choi, and calls them his friends. He is surprised
Zack
hasn't gone down yet, and also by how dirty Zack is fighting. He is doing all kinds of underhanded tactics like headbutting, hitting below the belt, and pivot blows: the tells of dirty boxing. Eugene tells them to stop fighting because Zack passed his test.
Jake
asks
Vasco
if he is really going to do a move that could kill someone, and Vasco tells him that he was the reason Vasco ended up this way.
Jerry
intercepts his elbow blows but injures his hand from the force.
Warren
left the fight with Jerry early because he was disappointed Jerry would not fight with all of his strength. They all stop fighting to watch
Daniel
fighting with the guy in the cap. Daniel's systema is barely keeping up with the other guy's speed. He tries to do a spinning kick but the guy grabs hold of him and pins him to the ground. Eugene tells Daniel he wants to talk to him, and he will tell him about
James Lee
in return.

Summary
Jiho
apologizes to
Daniel
for pushing him, blaming it on his insecurities. Before Daniel can get angry,
the teacher
thanks Jiho and tells the class he will be returning to prison shortly afterwards. Daniel wonders if Jiho has truly changed. As they are stepping out, Jiho asks the prison guard if he can use the bathroom. He runs into some old bullies from school, who harass him before he beats them and locks them in a stall. While he is washing his hands of their blood, Daniel approaches and asks him if he is truly sorry for what he did. Jiho tells him he would have been sorry if it were Daniel, but that he is not sorry for
James Lee
that was pushed. Driving back from school, the officer tells Jiho he will take him straight home. Jiho asks if he can meet someone and the officer obliges, saying he should make the most of his time outside of jail.
At the
Workers's
headquarters, Daniel asks
Eugene
when he can enter the second affiliate, but Eugene doesn't trust him yet. He upholds his end of the bargain and tells Daniel the story of James Lee and the History of Fists. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.
Jiho approaches
Big Deal
and asks to see
Jake
. One of the gangsters looks down on him, so he stabs him in the eye with the man's cigarette. Jake comes out with the commotion and asks if Jiho did that. Jiho says he kept his promise to Jake, and Jake asks him again.

Johan tells Hudson he can have Gangbuk if he wants. He went to a doctor earlier who told him he was losing his eyesight in the same manner as his mother, and he should not exploit them. If he doesn't find treatment, he will go blind permanently.
Jiho asks the prison guard is he's heard of James Lee before, and the guard finds it amusing. He says it doesn't matter since he is going back to prison, and laments that he did not get to go to the funeral of his grandmother. Jiho admits to the prison cop that he lied about his grandmother's death: he got his friends to fake the paperwork. Darius blocks the windshield of the car and leaps off just before the prison guard drives into a truck. Jiho steps out and tells the prison guard he didn't do anything wrong, so he doesn't deserve to go back to prison. Hudson has finished clearing out another karaoke club, one that he finds decent enough to run. The rest of Ansan Public arrive, waiting for James Lee to arrive. Jiho arrives with Darius and Ethan, calling himself James Lee.
Daniel is hanging out in DG's club that he owns. Daniel asks if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee.

Summary
Daniel
asks how he knows about the two bodies, and
DG
tells he's known since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about
James Lee
.
DG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by
Gapryong Kim
, who was known as the "Legendary Fist". The crews at this time were called "fists", and the crew heads were called "bosses", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called "circles". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of
Charles Choi's
geniuses
, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.
After announcing himself,
Channing
picks up
Jiho
and threatens to draw on him, and Jiho threatens to stab his eye with a toothpick.
Jacky
calms them down and Jiho tells
Ansan Publi
c that they need to stop pretending they care about James Lee, when they're only using his name as a reason to advance into Seoul territory.
Hudson
gives Jiho a score of 100 points and decides to listen to his offer. Jiho says he wants to start a crew called "James Lee". He can fill the members with
Backdoor
if Ansan will take care of the finances. Ansan reveals they want to start a private bar recruiting runaway kids from Gangdong. Channing will take care of the police and Jacky will take care of the workers. Jiho accepts and the James Lee crew is formed.
At
J High
, the students are discussing the news that Jiho was in an accident and escaped. Daniel and
Zack
talk about it when
Eli
comes in and annoucnes that Max and Derrick were attacked from James Lee, a guy who
Mr. Carpenter
knows well. Daniel mentions that Jiho might be involved in this matter, and Zack says if Jiho is involved, they also have to get involved.
Eugene
in his hot ride calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if
Workers
should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.

Jacky.
Zack
and Jace are pretending to be customers at a bar to get information on the illegal bar. Zack asks the girl next to him how old she is.

Zack
wakes up in despair that he could not protect anyone. He sees Vasco standing over him, holding the couple's tracker. He is staring at
Jace
, who
Channing
tattoed
Ansan's
name on after stripping him to his boxers. Vasco cries tears of blood, and he remembers Jace saying extreme anger can lead to a person doing that.
Darius
is making Daniel feel uncomfortable during his interview. Daniel stands up and asks where to see the boss instead, and Darius reveals he knows who Daniel is, and that his gang had prepared for them. Daniel punches Darius and rushes to the door, but
Hudson
appears and punches him back. He asks if Hudson is from Ansan, and he admits it. Hudson's punches are powerful enough to create holes in the wall. Daniel thinks it is kyoukoshin karate, but Hudson says it is just training. With Daniel cornered, he starts whaling on him, preparing to use his right fist. Daniel hits Hudson back and steps on Darius's face to launch a kick, but Darius grabs his ankle and Hudson punches him in the stomach. Daniel is incapacitated, and Hudson leaves Darius to do what he wants to Daniel's body. Before he can do anything, Daniel gets up and attacks him.
Samuel
explains elsewhere that the heated mode that arises during fighting is caused by inferior emotions that escalate into madness.

Zack
, looking for
Channing
. He tells Zack to not be a sorry loser and Zack decides to fight him, saying he never lost.

He kicks Zack into a car and Zack wonders aloud how he could lose this easily to these gangsters when he was doing so well against
Mandeok
. Jacky tells him he isn’t talented, and he should try something other than fighting. Zack is triggered and grabs Jacky, slamming him into a car. Jacky tries to escape but he is trapped within the metal folds Zack caused when he slammed him in there. Zack starts punching him in the face as Jacky begs for mercy before he passes out. Zack is satisfied he lost against someone stronger than Channing.
Vasco

Summary
As
Daniel
is fighting
Hudson
, Hudson recalls his call with
his senior
. He told the guy that
James Lee
may arrive in Seoul to squash the people using his name. His senior tells him not to use that name in vain, and Hudson says he is not joking. Daniel continues to slash Hudson in real time, and he says that the King of Ansan is coming, and he can’t let him see this mess. He rips off his shirt.
Channing
remembers when he used to bully people in school, tormenting his victims out of boredom. He tells
Vasco
he wants to be remembered forever as well, and slashes him with his tattoo gun. He mocks Vasco for playing crew with the
Burn Knuckles
, who are scrubs. Vasco says that he knows this, and it doesn’t matter because he will fight on their behalf. He said the same thing to the Burn Knuckles before, and
Jake
acknowledges this side of Vasco to
Lineman.
He punches Channing in the face, breaking the ground underneath him. Channing is stunned by the blow, and pulls out some more needles but Vasco keeps beating him. He wails that he was recognized by
Gun
and
Goo
three years ago, and Vasco uses
Brekdak’s
fifth forbidden move, and then a compressed low kick (his third forbidden move). Channing’s legs are crippled and Vasco tries to turn himself in, but the cop refuses.

Summary
Darius is asked what his dream guy would be like, and he says a strong man. When asked about DG he says it isn't possible to feel lust for a god. DG complains that he isn't as strong as he used to be, and leaves after beating up everyone.
Daniel and Hudson are exchanging blows. Hudson grabs his left arm to punch Daniel but he kicks him away. Hudson has a flashback to his master at a bonfire. The king of Ansan says that he will be giving the crew to Hudson, who will be the sun of Ansan. He offers him a roasted python and Hudson accepts his position. Hudson tries to motivate himself against Daniel but he is struggling because Daniel is copying his moves. Daniel kicks Hudson out of a window and slams his face into the ground as they fall. He tells Hudson to return as friends in the future.
Daniel then sees a guy walking towards him. He asks if he is the King of Ansan. DG is also walking in that direction when he notices something.

Summary
The guy ignores Daniel and walks to Hudson, saying he did well and it's okay he lost. He ignores Daniel a second time and says he isn't interested in the second generation, but he came for James Lee. Daniel asks if the guy is willing to lose again, and he gets irritated.
Tom Lee narrates that there were many powerful leaders of the first generation, one of them being Taesoo Ma, king of Ansan who Daniel is currently fighting. Taesoo has the trademark of only fighting with his right fist. He is very powerful, damaging Daniel's arm and stopping his reverse kick.
Taesoo recalls his past when he fought with James Lee and lost. James acknowledged Taesoo but said it was time for the first generation of fighters to end. Since Taesoo would never stop fighting, he decided to cut his finger off. Taesoo pleaded with him to take his right eye instead. Since then, Taesoo has wanted revenge against DG, and to do the same to him.
Daniel gets back up and says he will show Taesoo how powerful the second generation can be. Vasco uses Brekdak's skill No.5 on Taesoo, and Zack punches him with chains in his hands. Taesoo is pleased with them all and tells them to come at him. Then DG comes flying from the building to kick Taesoo. He tells Daniel to go inside since there is someone waiting for him.

Summary
Daniel, Zack and Vasco enter the building looking for Jiho. They find a Backdoor member who says Jiho is waiting for Daniel at the place, and he wants Daniel to come as himself and not James Lee. Zack is confused and wants to come with Daniel, but Daniel says he must go alone. He goes home and dresses in his uniform in his original body.
DG is fighting Taesoo, who doesn't recognize him. Hudson wakes up and is surprised with how quiet and calculating DG is during battle. Hudson starts crying seeing his idol lose, and Taesoo remembers his loss to DG. DG leans over Taesoo and says even though he lost, he is still cool. Taesoo recognizes DG and breaks down, flinging at him wildly with both fists. Hudson and DG are shocked to see Taesoo break his own rule of only using his right fist.

Summary
Ever since Taesoo lost to DG, he has been training his left fist for revenge. Even though he abandoned his principle, it didn't matter if he could kill DG. Now his fist reaches DG. Hudson is shocked to see James Lee threatened by Taesoo and dodging his powerful punches. DG however tells Taesoo that he's gotten weaker, and he kicks him to the ground. Taesoo recalls DG telling him after their first fight that the reason he was so powerful was the faith he had in himself. By giving up on his values, Taesoo is weaker in DG's perspective.
Hudson sees his idol crumbling before him and starts crying. DG tells Taesoo not to bother him, and he says that it doesn't matter. The first generation know that James Lee exists, and they will come after him for their own reasons. DG says it wouldn't be a problem since the second generation isn't made of pushovers.
Daniel confronts Jiho at the convenience store and asks him if he still pretends to smoke. Jiho asks how Daniel knew the location, and he says this was the first place the two of them fought. He then tells Daniel that he asked him to come like this because he has two bodies.

Summary
Darius visited Jiho in prison before he left and reported what he found out about Daniel. He couldn't find any information about his family except that they lived abroad. His friend just slept the entire day. Looking into his school files he found that the fat Daniel was on the school record. Jiho asks Darius if he has ever seen the two of them together.
Back at the convenience store Jiho reassures Daniel he hasn't told anyone the truth about his identity. He asks Daniel to give him the secret of the two bodies, but Daniel refuses and tells him to turn himself in. Jiho smashes Daniel into the window and says that he should understand the most how he feels. He slams his head into the ground and tries to choke Daniel with a string but he escapes. Jiho sticks a wine opener in his chest and twists it before slashing Daniel. Jiho stands over Daniel and says they are the same person, but Daniel just got lucky.
Daniel has a flashback to a meeting with Duke. His fans came into the room and Daniel mistakenly greeted them before they asked Duke for a picture. In real time, Daniel punches Jiho into a convenience machine and tells him to stop blaming his appearance for his failures, because people can change. Jiho tells Daniel he can't change, and Wally stabs Daniel in the back but Daniel removes the knife and throws him away. Daniel then starts beating Jiho with systema. Jiho begs for Daniel to forgive him and give him another chance. Daniel helps him up before elbowing him in the head, saying that Jiho doesn't get another chance.

Summary
Without hesitating, Jiho tells Jake that Daniel has two bodies. Jake grabs Jiho and yells at him to get it together, and that Jiho should have never left prison without taking care of his condition. He asks Jiho who he met in prison, and Jiho runs away. Worried about him, Jake sends two of his men after Jiho.
Jake talks to Brad and Jason about Jiho. Jason mentions how Jiho got a lighter sentence of two years despite his charge of attempted homicide, and Brad says it's understandable he wouldn't want to be caught. A Big Deal member comes in to tell Jake they've found Jiho, but there's a problem. Daniel Park and the detective run to a building where Jiho is on the roof, talking to someone. At some point, Jiho falls off the roof and Daniel fails to catch him.
At Jiho's funeral his parents weep for him. The detective goes over his medical report and notes that the reason for his early release was a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. The police searched the security cameras after the incident, but they couldn't find a second person. Only Jiho had entered the building. It turns out Jiho had been talking to a younger version of himself, who assured him that he has a plan to win before pushing him off the building. As he falls, Jiho thinks that he isn't a bug.
Eugene is on the phone when someone asks him why he seems happy. He mentions that a friend of his passed recently, but also that the sales of his circus have been rising. He compliments the Workers 2nd affiliate.

Doo
and

Doo asks Daniel if he's out of his mind especially after Daniel saw what kind of games they plan in the Circus. But Daniel response that it doesn't matter and that he's going to betray the alliance.
Eugene is eating with Neko as
Mandeok
guards behind Eugene and
Nomen
guards behind Neko. Eugene tells Neko that he doesn't believe that Daniel is going to betray the alliance because Daniel was the one who destroyed the 3rd and 4th affiliates. Eugene believes that Daniel is planning to make Workers think that he betrayed the alliance just so he can destroy the 2nd affiliate. So, then Eugene says how he'll make members of the alliance participate in the alliance so that Workers can eliminate them. Eugene thanks Neko for helping him out. Neko thanks Eugene for letting her meet Sinu. But then she her knife at Eugene's neck telling him that if anyone dares to ruin what they have, she will murder them, including Eugene.

Summary
The episode begins with
Doo Lee
observing that his friends at the Circus are managing to get by, wondering how
Daniel Park
(2nd body) managed to warn them.
A flashback takes place where it shows that Doo worked at the second branch on the cleaning crew, he tells his crew during a sidewalk cleaning about a game called "Doo Lee's Game",
Eugene
overheard him telling about this game and how it became an executive at the
2nd affiliate
, he regrets that his gambling brought the sadistic deaths of dozens of people.
The third game, Quest-ism (or produce) begins, (see Workers page for game details) the first to receive a mission was
Akira Katsuzawa
, his mission was to pull out the teeth of player #71, Akira, after hearing who would receive a reward of 500 million won, attacks without any qualms, he is applauded by the VIP crowd, Daniel decides to keep an eye on the Japanese
Quickly, the other players begin to receive their respective missions, the most important and relevant to the plot:
Zack Lee
: Should break the nose of player #27,
Li Chao
(Taegon Wi's kidnapper), Zack denies it at first, but remembers that everyone there is a criminal and completes his mission without any problems
Vin Jin
: Must protect himself from being without his glasses for three minutes, players who managed to remove Vin's glasses would be rewarded.
Daniel Park
: Must kick player #70,
Minsik Choi
, in the testicles, Daniel succeeds, Minsik doesn't seem to care, knowing he did it because it was his mission
Sally Park
: She must hit player #41 in the head, she lies that she did it so as not to disturb her teammates
Warren Chae
: Must defeat Akira Katsuzawa in combat, Warren charges in, and lands a blow, Akira suddenly gives up, as he has already accomplished his mission.
After Warren completes his quest, he goes with Sally on the way to the next game with the others, until the door stops Sally from going, she explains that she lied about having completed her mission, as she continues in the arena, some participants go to harass her.
Before this happens,
Minsik Choi

Summary
The Burn Knuckles
join the fight.
Vasco
waits patiently, and is jumped from behind by one of the three henchmen, the judo guy, who grabs Vasco's shoulders. Vasco easily raises his arms, breaking free effortlessly. Vasco uses his famous vice grip (shoulder grab) to bring him down. Everyone who's felt it sympathizes with the pain.
Meanwhile,
Jay
smokes next to his motorcycle. Apparently, Woojin called more backup (freshmen), and Jay took them all down by himself. A new face (with another guy) appears, complimenting Jay's fighting skill, saying they don't like the kids from Gian High. He tells Jay that he should stop smoking or he won't get a lover, then he and the other guy leave. Jay drops his cigarette and decides to quit smoking.
Back to the main events, we have Woojin feeling caged. He charges
Daniel
, since he mistakes Daniel's nervousness as weakness, and realizes that both Vasco and
Zack
just calmly watch. He wonders why, trying to punch Daniel, but of course our cinnamon roll dodges like a boss. Because of the girls behind him, Daniel knows he can't do anything but fight, so he jabs (quick punch) at Woojin. Woojin jumps back before it hits him. Daniel decides to retry a straight (Zack's signature punch, which Zack showed little Daniel before), and steps forward, hooking (swinging from the side) him in the stomach, then going for the straight, right in the face. The fight is over. Vasco tells Woojin to cherish his girlfriend. Haeri cries over Woojin, holding his hand, and Vasco cries out of jealousy. Vasco insists that the BNC walk home because they don't have helmets.
Gun
was watching the whole time, recognizing Daniel's improvement. The beaten Woojin, leaning on Haeri, and the big judo guy approach and notice Gun (they were in the same high school). They chitchat, and Gun's apparently the same age as them (has to take the qualifying exam for university).
Back at school, Zack says Daniel must be a boxer and he lied, and wants a rematch in an official ring.
Namsoo
notices that Zack got his shoes in the end and envies it, knowing he couldn't have bought them for the amount of money he had. That's when
Yui
asks Zack if he'll study for mid-term exams (he won't), which makes Daniel realize he didn't study at all.
Notes
The guys who advised Jay to quit smoking to find a lover are from PTJ's other work, "The Real Anti-Smoking Campaign."

Summary
This episode starts off in a classroom, where people are casually talking about how time flies so quickly.
Jiho Park
is being bullied by
Doo Lee
and his friends who are forcing him to fan them. The homeroom teacher comes in and tells everyone to be quiet, stating that there's a new transfer student.
Daniel
enters the room and everyone becomes astounded at his heavenly attractiveness. The girls' hearts race while the boys become slightly alert and jealous of his appearance.
Daniel goes to his assigned seat and tries to make friends with whoever is next to him, so he smiles and greets whoever is next to him. To his shock, Daniel realizes that the person sitting next to him is
Zack
, the boy who punched him earlier.
Zoe Park
begins flirting with him, and Daniel is confused how to respond. Zack sees
Mira
staring at Daniel and he becomes jealous of him. The next scene is set in the cafeteria, where Daniel eats with Zoe. He is happy he isn't being bullied, and is unaware of her aggressive protectiveness over him.
Doo and his friends confront Daniel and tell him to meet them after lunch, which worries Daniel. Surprisingly they offer him a cigarette and say that he should hook them up with girls. Daniel lies to them that he quit smoking (so that he doesn't have to smoke while not making himself look 'uncool') and informs them that he doesn't know any girls. The three other boys, including Doo, feel intimidated and think of Daniel as imposing while he quickly runs off in fear.
Later, Daniel is seen peacefully sleeping with Zoe watching him adoringly. Daniel wakes up in his old body and panics, trying to force himself to sleep. As he wakes up he accidentally swears at Zoe, but this only makes her fall for him even more.

at night. During the math test he finds it hard to concentrate because he was staring at Zoe the whole time. Daniel falls asleep and wakes up in his other body when he gets the idea to study at home.
After the exam, Daniel finds out he placed top, beating Jay and the class president. Jay is proud of Daniel for being the top student but the president cries out of jealousy. He is angry because his only good trait is his intelligence. Daniel feels ashamed of himself and decides never to cheat again. He decides to exercise in his old body as well.

Summary
The episode starts at Big Deal Street where
Jake
is resting on a desk.
Jerry
approaches Jake with a report of everything
Lua
could find about the pre-generation and the first generation. The information revealed the status of many members of the pre-generation and it was revealed that Jerry's father Baekho Kwon died on the same day as
Gapryong Kim
. Lua makes her way into the room so; Jerry and Jake consider making an excuse to leave. But Lua reveals that the
Workers
are plotting something.
Samuel is on call with
Eugene
who is surrounded by
Mandeok
and the
mysterious capped man
after his fight with
Eli
against
Seokdu Wang
. Samuel tells Eugene that Eli has taken down the King of Pyeongtaek. Eugene tells Samuel that he can skip Workers meeting for the day.
Ryuhei
,
Kenta
and
Kazuma
are early to the meeting. Ryuhei is impatient that Eugene isn't present, but Kenta responds that they're here early. Eugene greets the three of them and reveals that he has also summoned
Xiaolong
, who has returned from China to the meeting. Ryuhei approaches Xiaolong and starts insulting him only for Xiaolong to hit him causing Ryuhei to fall back. Eugene tells the two to cut it out. While Ryuhei apologizes, he sticks a sticky note that reads "dumbass" on Xiaolong's back. Eugene then reveals that the Workers will hunt for
Big Deal
and everyone is free to kill any members.
The episode goes back to Jake and Lua's conversation. Lua says that they need to come up with a plan to stop the Workers now that they've taken down Hostel and Big Deal is most likely next. Jake accepts that Big Deal is about to enter war with the Workers and tells Lua that he's planning to meet somebody. Jake questions if there's somebody that can help him.
Towards the end of the chapter, Vasco is shown destroying concreate,
Zack
has finished his training with
Gongseop Ji
, and original
Daniel
has finished his training with
Gun
showing that Daniel's body has changed.

Summary
Eugene is playing a game of tennis with Mandeok and asks if Mandeok really wants to fight Big Deal especially since Mandeok hates fighting. But Mandeok still agrees.
Ryuhei is in front of
Mitsuki's
door and tells her that the Workers are planning to go after Big Deal and that the Second Affiliate has no choice but to join. Ryuhei tells Mitsuki that they will have to fight
Shiba Inu
again. Mitsuki comes out and tells Ryuhei to come back safe and sound.
Xiaolong visits the penthouse above club Vivi and reflects on the events that happened during the
third affiliate arc
and leaves.
The Big Deal members meet again, and Lua explains to them how after gathering information, there's nothing they can do to stop the Workers from going after Big Deal. Lua explains that it's going to be a struggle considering the Workers' numbers and how many powerful fighters they have on their side.
Jason
asks Jake if they should call
Sinu
, but it is revealed that Sinu and
Yeonhui
already left the street together, entrusting the street to Jake. Jake refuses telling them that Sinu has found happiness and that they need to leave him be. Jake leaves again to meet with someone he's been unable to meet.
Lower Big Deal members are discussing the news about Hostel being taken down and wondering if Big Deal is next. Jerry approaches them letting them know that if they're scared, they can run.
Brad
and Jason are staring across the ocean discussing the events. Jason asks Brad what he'll do if Big Deal disbands, but the two decide that they can't give up and that they need to show the Workers what they're made of.
Samuel and Eugene are then walking together in a parking garage. Eugene is surprised that Samuel was willing to take part in the hunt for Big Deal, but Samuel says he hasn't had a change of heart. Samuel has been gifted Eugene a car and Samuel is thankful.
Jake is then meeting with the person he's been unable to meet, and it is revealed that it is
Charles Choi
. Charles is then revealed to be
Elite
, a member of the
pre-generation
and Gapryong Kim's second in command. Jake introduces himself as Gapryong's son and the chapter ends where the two are about to discuss the
Workers
.

Summary
The next day begins when the kids go rafting. Won Bin notices the girls laughing at
Zeus
when he splashes them but complaining when he does.
Mira
gets suspicious of Won Bin, who keeps looking at her the entire trip. Won Bin goes to the teachers room and notices them drinking with the student's confiscated drinks. He is disgusted by their behavior and goes to find Mira.
Won Bin finds Mira in the store room helping Zeus lift some boxes. He tackles Zeus and they start fighting. Mira helps Zeus fend off Won Bin and he thanks her. Then he turns and starts acting creepy. Daniel finds in his old body a poster of Zeus as a sex offender, specifically a rapist.
The reason Won Bin had Mira's picture was because he wanted to find who was taking creepshots. He found Zeus hanging out near her and found him on the pervert website posting the creepshots. Zeus attacks Mira and tells her to take off her clothes.

Zeus
has flashbacks to his past as a child. He was always allowed to get away with hurting others because he was handsome. Girls would cheat on their boyfriends, which fueled his perverted views on sex. He even raped girls because he believed everyone secretly liked him. Won Bin attacks Zeus and he starts beating him.
Zack
asks the other students if they've seen
Mira
.
Daniel
wakes up in his other body and calls the police to report a sex offender. Zack overhears the conversation and races out the room to find Mira. He walks in to find Zeus taking off Mira's clothes and blood on her face.

Summary
Daniel
goes to a department store to get his mother a gift for Thanksgiving. He is walking by his old neighborhood when he meets an old classmate who used to watch him get bullied. The classmate distracts him long enough to bring the other bystanders to Daniel's bullying.
They reveal that this kid became
Logan's
new pet (bullying victim) after Daniel disappeared. They take his money and his lucky charm from his mother. Daniel asks for it back and when they attack him he is surprised to find he is stronger than before. He stops fighting when he sees Logan Lee.

Summary
Daniel
is traumatized when he sees
Logan
and does everything he asks, just like Pavlov's Dog.
One of the girls
gives Daniel his mother's gift and he is disappointed he didn't fight for the money. He decides to use his other body to get the money back.
Daniel gets to the bus station and meets
Jay
, who is also going on a solo trip. Daniel is headed to Sunukdo, and
Jay
is heading to Busan for a vacation. He changes his ticket and gets on the train with Daniel.
Notes
Pavlov's dog was a famous experiment where a scientist conditioned a dog to associate food with a bell. In Daniel's case, he associated Logan Lee with fear.

Summary
Daniel
gets a job at a local convenience store selling cigarettes. While he finds that in his new body, the owner is very willing to hire him, the owner is more reluctant when it comes to his old body. In fact, the owner almost doesn't hire him, until Daniel shows that he has a very adept knowledge of cigar brands, due to his days as a 'cigarette servant.' Though, the salary is still lower in his old body.
During his shift, he comes across
Zack
and his friends who are trying to buy some cigarettes. He refuses them and gets beaten, and
one of them
take a nude picture of him to blackmail him. When his mother calls him again he tells her his life is going well, but doesn't mention the incident. When Daniel returns to school he finds that the guys are making fun of his picture to the other classmates.

Summary
The episode begins with unnamed spectators admiring Binu for her pedigree as a purebred retriever. These spectators then proceed to ridicule Enu, Binu's puppy, for not being a purebred retriever. Undeterred by their disparaging remarks, young Byeol insists upon raising Enu, suggesting that they "live together forever." As the two grow older, however, Byeol comes to regard Enu as others do. The frequent criticism directed towards Enu begins to influence her decisions; Byeol ceases to bring Enu along with her when she goes on outings, ordering the dog to stay at home. This eventually culminates with Byeol giving the order to stay when her family moves, and it is thus that the girl abandons the pet she'd once desired to live with all her life.
Enu, being an obedient dog, stays. She stays by the gate after the sky grows dark, and she continues staying after it darkens again. She stays after new occupants move into the house, and she stays after she has grown thin and dirty. She stays even after her ribs begin to protrude out from under her skin.
The neighbors pity Enu, and denounce Byeol and her family for leaving the dog behind. They do not report Enu's status as an abandoned pet, understanding that the common response to such animals is to euthanize them. The neighbors therefore make shallow attempts to help the dog by offering her food. Enu, however, reacts to them aggressively. She barks at them and bares her teeth, mistaking them for thieves. It is revealed that Enu believes the house to still belong to Byeol and her family, and that she must therefore perform her duty as their dog by guarding it until they return.
Night falls once more, and the temperatures with it. Enu is shown lying on the ground, shivering from how cold she feels. Her face is buried into the scarf Byeol gave her to wear.
The scene transitions to
J High School
. The nameless teacher who announced the arrival of
Daniel Park
as a transfer student now informs the Fashion Department's first-year class of yet another such transfer. As with Daniel, the immediate response from the class is to ask whether the student is a guy or a girl. Upon hearing that the student is a girl,
Kay Jang
,
Han Park
, and
Doo Lee
express great excitement. Then
Crystal Choi
walks into the room, and the trio sit back with dejected looks on their faces.
Daniel stares at Crystal, thinking of how unusual it is to transfer into a new school right before winter vacation, and of how similar the girl is to him. The girl in question, meanwhile, stands amid hushed gibes. She gazes out at her new classmates and mentally divides them into different cliques, categorizing
Mira Kim
,
Yui Kim
, and
Zoe Park
as "cool girls"; three unnamed girls as "outsiders," but also the group she belongs with;
Jay Hong
,
Daniel Park
, and
Zack Lee
as the "cool guys"; and Han Park, Doo Lee, and Kay Jang as "guys who mock and embarrass" her. Due to the treatment she receives whenever she transfers, Crystal is uninterested in school and chooses to hide in quiet corners while there. Daniel cannot tear his eyes away from her as he recalls the humiliation he suffered from his classmates in his original body.
Right after it is whispered that Crystal "looks funny" and is a "weirdo," Daniel approaches her. He greets her with a hello and a friendly smile, and introduces himself. The boy also chides Doo Lee for his comments regarding the area where Crystal lives.

Summary
It is the weekend, and
Daniel
is heading to
Vasco's
birthday party with
Enu
. Due to his drinking problem, Daniel assures himself that Vasco will hold the party at a normal cafe or restaurant. He reveals that both bodies were invited, but he wanted to go as his original.
Crystal
is also jogging in her original body, saying that it has become a habit to run. However, she meets Enu, who bites her, and realizes that Daniel is also close by. They make small talk, and both of them lament being in their original bodies; Daniel thinking that he cannot talk to her because if his new body had no chance, his original does not have any either, and Crystal thinking that she cannot talk to him because all guys like pretty girls. They both head to the Han River, thinking that they "don't want to split."
Vasco turns out to be partying in the park, in the wintertime, on a blanket. He is incredibly happy that Daniel made it, and the latter excuses his new body by saying that he is sick. Vasco asks if Crystal is Daniel's girlfriend, which he denies. Three
Burn Knuckles
are there, as well as
Zack
and
Mira
and
Taejoon
. They are all freezing, and Daniel tries to ask Vasco to go indoors, but Vasco is so happy that no one has the heart to say it.
The Burn Knuckles apparently had a party at a pork restaurant, and they had drawn lots to see who would go to the park party, because "we didn't all need to die,"
Jace
explains to Daniel. Zack tries to leave the fool's party, but Mira convinces him to stay. They sing Happy Birthday to Vasco, and everyone is relieved when the candles are blown out, as surely Vasco would move inside now; but Vasco pretends not to notice and blows anyway.
Daniel gives Vasco pictures of Enu's pups, since he knows about Vasco's love of dogs. Vasco is touched. Jace, who searched for months, presents Vasco with a Special Edition Heroman figurine. Vasco is moved. Zack grabs a rock and writes "GOOD LUCK" on it, insisting that it was a treasure from his mother and it will grant good luck to its owner. Vasco is again moved, as the others note that Zack isn't even bothering to hide the magic marker. Taejoon creates a Pacebook account for Vasco and gathers 100,000 followers, which Vasco responds to with apathy.
Vasco wants to play a recreational mating game, in which "three" consists of the third Burn Knuckle, Jace, and Daniel, the last two wondering what would happen to Vasco and Crystal. Jace tries again to move the party indoors but fails. Vasco calls "two" and reaches for Mira, but Zack, in a burst of fury, clips his nose. Vasco, blood streaming from his face, insists that it was an accident, and they move on.
Daniel is chosen to play Duck, Duck, Goose. The three Burn Knuckles try again to talk to Vasco, but when he thanks Jace for always being his friend, Jace is too moved to speak. Zack tries to leave again, but it stopped by Mira. Then, Zack thinks about making Vasco mad. He takes out the Heroman figurine, replaces it with his rock, and throws the present into the river, saying that "Heroman went for a swim in the water." Vasco jumps in after the present.

Summary
Vasco yells that he will not come out of the river until he finds Jace's present. Jace calls out to him, but Zack stops him, saying that if there is a fight to come, Vasco should use up his strength before it.
Police have arrived ono the scene, and Vasco has knocked out the entire Rescue Team. The Police ask if there is a tranquilizer gun for catching bears, to which the answer is negative. Zack realizes that Vasco's stamina is limitless. A reporter hears Vasco repeating the words "gift" and "precious" and deduces that he has been heartbroken by a lover. At last, Zack jumps into the river with the figurine that he took out earlier and calls to Vasco.
Vasco and Zack get out and have some warm drinks, but Vasco realizes that Zack's rock and the Heroman box are still missing. Vasco again jumps into the river, intent on finding the rock. All the guys jump into the water as Mira and Crystal wonder if they should call the authorities again. Daniel starts drowning and is saved by Enu. While Crystal is desperately trying to make Daniel wake up,
Eli
appears on the scene and creates another Good Luck rock. He hands it to Zack, who waves it at Vasco again. Everyone starts getting out of the river when Vasco notices something.
Zack ceremoniously turns to present the rock to Vasco again when he sees Vasco holding both the box and the rock. Vasco demands to know who was at the root of the problem, and everyone points to Zack. The party ends with Zack's K.O.
Jay
is seen watching the 9 o'clock news as he sees Crystal kneeling over Daniel on television.
Zoe
also sees this and wonders sadly why Daniel is with another girl. Crystal, now in her new body, snaps a picture of this scene of the TV and happily saves it as her background picture on her phone.

Summary
Zack pulls ahead near the end of the race. Since Mira is watching, he is determined to win.
Young Mira shows young Zack her stuffed bear Brownie, calling it her best friend. Zack calls it childish, and asks what he is if the bear is her best friend. As Mira drops Brownie, Zack demands if this is how she treats her best friend when he realizes Mira is in pain. After running Mira to the hospital, it is revealed that Mira had burst her appendix, but she thanks Zack, saying that he was amazing.
Meanwhile, in present day, Zack runs out of stamina. Daniel overtakes him by 0.04 seconds. In the talent show, Daniel and Duke perform again.
Zack is sitting on the steps, mourning his loss, when Mira and Daniel come to find him. He does not hear Daniel's explanation for being with Mira and instead assumes that it is because he is a loser. However, Mira drops her phone, which Daniel fails to catch. However, Zack is closer to the phone and is able to catch it. Mira says he has saved Brownie again, and Zack sees the bear keychain attached to her phone. Again, Zack is called amazing, and he is in renewed spirit as he heads to the party. At the party, he continues to catch anything that is dropped.

Summary
It's raining and dark out.
Mira
and
Zack
are sharing an umbrella as they walk to school. Mira had forgotten her cellphone at school, and Zack had agreed to accompany her to school.
When at school, Mira suddenly sees two figures and screams. It turns out to be
Jace
and
Vasco
. Vasco clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. They great each other and ask if Zack's ok. Zack pretends he is, but he is actually frozen in fear.
It turns out that Vasco and Jace are there because of the story of the ghost lady. Apparently, at the end of the school corridor, there's a storage room that holds a portrait of the ghost lady. The story goes that the lady had married rich, but had been chased into the streets on a rainy day right after her children were born. Hence, she haunts the schoolyard when it rains, trying to find her children. If someone who isn't a child looks into her eyes, they will die unless they either cry like a baby or give her a doll. If they give her a doll, the ghost lady would be so glad that she would disappear and grant the person a wish.
Vasco says that he's come because he wanted to make a wish for people to stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Vasco's superstitious ideas, making fun of Vasco, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.
When Zack arrives at the storage room, he realizes that the lights can't open. He then rushes over to a pane of glass, only to see the portrait of the ghost lady leering at him, bloodshot eyes wide. Zack hurriedly signs his name on the glass and skidaddles. As he runs back to the classroom, he cries like a baby just in case.
At the classroom, Jace is incredulous that Zack had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Vasco, but, Vasco, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.
The next morning, the school is abuzz with the news that Zack had signed his name on the portrait, and everyone flocks to the storage room to see if it is true.
When they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane. Zack realizes that the portrait's lady's eyes are closed, and that he had actually seen the ghost the night before. He faints and wets his pants.
In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.
In the epilogue,
Daniel
says that he's felt as if someone was following for a while already. He wonders if he's ill. The ghost lady is seen following him, blushing. The chapter ends, saying that the ghost lady seems to have fallen in love.

Eugene (유진 Yoojin)
is a major character in Lookism, the current head chairman of
Workers
. He was part of the
Ten Geniuses
as a Genius of Conduct and is now working towards taking down
Charles Choi
.
Appearance
Eugene had originally appeared in episodes with only the reflection of his glasses shown and his face shadowed. He has pale skin, a general smaller figure, and a bright smile. He has a neat, frayed hairstyle for his black hair. Johan noted him to look 'so ordinary.'
[
4
]
Eugene wears his school uniform everywhere, which consists of a white undershirt with stripe tie, and orange plaid pants laid out under his royal blue coat. He also wears round spectacles. When Eugene was first shown, he was wearing a black and white tuxedo.
[
5
]
Personality
Eugene displays a kind attitude, smiling and attempting to act in people's favor. However, he is deceiving when people don't act to his will. He will create tactics and plan ahead of time for things to be in his favor, as seen with labeling his invitation from 'Olly.'  Apart from planning ahead of time, he has also proven to be a quick decision-maker. Additionally, surrounding people close to the main
J High fighters
, in order to corner them and manipulate them into his will.
He is considerably intelligent as well, not only attending a prestigious private high school, but also operating a successful business at a young age and planning other sorts of warfare within Seoul. He does a great analysis of the other characters whilst barely knowing them, perhaps from gained knowledge through affiliations, but proves his predictability with situations.
Whenever something bad or on a desperate situation, he just slumps, seemingly broken and hopeless. He stays that way, unless his minions assist him.
Trivia
Eugene is multilingual, being fluent in Japanese and Chinese. He is seen conversing with Neko and Ryuhei in Japanese,
[
6
]
and Xiaolung in Chinese.
He might be ambidextrous, as he is seen eating with both hands and writing/playing tennis with his left.
The assembly ranks are divided according to the badge, and in
Episode 299
, there seems to be a badge that means "President", though Eugene's badge has not yet been revealed. It was revealed that there was a presidential badge with functions such as measuring heart rate and checking vital functions.
Eugene has access to cars such as: Chrysler 300, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and Mercedes-Benz S-class.
It was revealed by
Steve Hong
that Eugene was part of the Ten Geniuses as a Genius of Conduct.

“
"I know you're struggling right now, but don't turn to darkness. If you don't overcome that temptation now, you'll find yourself swallowed up by that darkness. Trust us. Trust Zack. Trust Daniel. Trust Hostel. Trust Vasco. Trust Euntae Tee. I...did it. I overcame it. If I did it, so can you."
”
— Vasco trying to persuade
Eli Jang
,
Ep. 459
Euntae Lee
(이은태 Lee Eun Tae)
, better known as
Vasco
, is a secondary character in
Lookism
. Once a young boy who suffered from extreme physical bullying, Vasco vowed to protect the weak by becoming strong enough to beat the bad guys. He would train and push the limits of his body. Eventually, he became so physically strong that he could win a fight with just a single shoulder grab.
With his newfound strength, Vasco would go around Central Seoul finding delinquents and trying to get them to stop smoking via his shoulder grip. His raw strength and pure intentions would resonate with many of the delinquents. Most quit smoking and began to follow Vasco. Going as far as to enroll in J High School just to be closer to him.
This newfound following would eventually lead to the creation of Burn Knuckles. They would use their power to protect the weak while preventing major gangs from forming in Central Seoul, thereby inadvertently preventing any of the
Four Major Crews
from taking over Central Seoul and keeping the territory neutral. Halfway during 1st year, he would meet and eventually befriend
Daniel Park
. This friendship would eventually lead him into the underworld of Seoul's Generations, filled with crime and unchecked violence. Seeing such injustice and how much it affected his friends, he swore to help Daniel destroy the four crews. Since then, Vasco and Burn Knuckles have been in numerous gang fights throughout Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the
Four Major Crews
,
1st Generation Kings
,
HNH Company
, and
Workers
.
Currently, he is a student in the Architecture Department at
J High School
, the leader of Burn Knuckles, and one of the founding members of
Allied
. His current goal is to prevent
James Lee
and
Kitae Kim
from starting another generation of war.
Appearance
Episodes 7-366
PTJ art style changing overtime (Episodes 7-366)
From his first appearance in Episode 7, Vasco stood out as looking older than his age. His skin is fair and smooth, with a slender face and jet-black hair parted in the center. Vasco has dark, almond eyes with thin eyebrows. He has a well-toned muscular body with Japanese-style tattoos covering both arms and pectorals. Vasco, despite his slender face, grows an impressive amount of facial hair, often sporting a bushy beard and small mustache. Throughout the story, Vasco refused to wear the school's uniform, opting instead to wear various kinds of Burn Knuckles jumpsuits until the 2nd year. He always wrapped the jumpsuit shirt around his waist, along with a white undershirt. Due to his clothing choices, it's easy to mistake him for an active gangster.
At the time of the blind date (episodes 178-179)
Vasco doesn't care about his appearance and regularly forgets to groom. However, as seen in
Vasco's Blind Date
, when he decides to get dressed up, he becomes a different person.
He turns into a pretty boy by shaving and cleverly hiding his physique with his clothes. Instead of scaring people away, his attractive appearance makes him look more younger and approachable.
Youth
Childhood and Middle School Days (Episodes 51-57)
Throughout his elementary and middle school days, Vasco was underweight for his age. His arms were like sticks, and you could see his ribs from the sides. It's a big contrast from the muscular body he has now.
He still had the same hairstyle, and his eyes were just as narrow. He gained many vulgar scars around his body from his former bullies in middle school, his many tattoos being a way to cover them up.
Personality
Even being stated by Jace, Euntae is known to have a unique personality. Although he appears to look scary and menacing, Euntae is actually very pure-hearted and innocent. He cares deeply for those who get treated in an ill manner in society and risks his own life to protect them. Euntae believes that everyone should be treated fairly and the views of respect they achieve should be based on their actions, not on their looks. Euntae is also a strong-willed person, not afraid to keep trying his best to achieve his goals.
While he is a strong-minded and headstrong person, Euntae is surprisingly very sensitive and delicate whenever he is emotionally upset. Some examples are when he starts crying when girls bought other male students at the Auction but didn't want to buy him because they thought he looked too fearsome. Another moment when Euntae starts crying was when he said that people took him for a fool. Euntae is quite compassionate and appreciates the special bonds he has with his friends, especially Jace. Euntae also wants to help the less appreciated people in society become stronger so that they can defeat those who torment and oppress them.
Euntae seems to have a strong respect for teachers and higher authorities in general. He also has respect for the mama bear that raised him in one Night arc and even says that he can't ever lose in respect to his master Brendak.
As the story progresses, Euntae has an increase in his desire to grow. Originally branching from an empathetic mindset, he expressed a sensibility to others situations.

Believing that he should always save those who cannot fend for themselves and are weak, he ambitions to become a superhero for them, coming from his understanding of his experience in bullying and self-hatred. However, as result of his self-obsession with becoming a better person, Euntae transforms into believing anyone associated with wrongdoing is inherently bad, with no pity to understand their perspective. His mindset is revolutionized to become the 'villain' as of result. He states to Jake, "For me to beat the bad guys, I have to become one."

Fighting Techniques
After doing 100 push-ups, 100 pull-ups, 100 squats and running 10 km every day for 2 years, Euntae is one of the strongest characters in the entire series. Many of the delinquents of middle school who dared challenge him were taken down from a single shoulder grab. Euntae's strength has been so overpowering, he has shown in numerous fights to simply take people out in a single move and even lift some up with a single hand. And while Euntae was unable to match with Daniel's new body, he was able to compete with him when he was drunk. Euntae is also incredibly fast as during the live streaming arc and Fake Bank account arc he is seen covering vast distances very easily.
When he met up with Joon Goo once again and after doubling his already insane workout, Euntae got progressively stronger. He lifted Logan Lee with one of his legs, bent steel bars in the Picnic arc and break bones casually. After his training from Brekdak, Euntae has some training in Muay Thai.
Finally, Euntae is known for his indomitable will power and endurance. He is willing to go through immense physical pain and never give in or surrender. His aura in fact as been noted to be terrifying to even gangsters.
After training with Brekdak and the bears for a short time, Euntae's strength and endurance grew unto unbelievable levels, as he still managed to attack after getting his legs crushed by Vin Jin. Given his golden Mongkol, it is implied that he has mastered his Muay Thai training and from living in the wilderness with his bear/master, he managed to unlock a new technique called the Death Blow: a powerful punch that can send people flying.
After retraining again with Brekdak for the month leading up to the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Brekdak himself stated that Vasco's physique and power is enough to take on just about anyone (but was eventually proven wrong as he couldn't handle a blow from James Lee), but that statement was holding up pretty well as the sheer force of his blows was pushing Mandeok extremely far back; Mandeok would have lost the fight as Mandeok himself thought that it is shocking that such as little body (stated by him) generated so much power.
Techniques Used
Runner's High
In the  Worker's First Affiliate arc when Euntae was fighting against Eli Jang, It was revealed that the first forbidden move of Brekdak is actually controlling a phenomenon known as
"Runner's High"
where a person can feel euphoria after tremendous physical activity (like
The Stage
or
Mastery
). After rigorous training, Euntae was able to control the phenomenon and his eyes become pale white and his body unlocks its peak potential. Brekdak also mentioned that when the Runner's high is controlled, all other techniques that Euntae mastered can be evolved.
In the second half of the fight with Eli Jang, Euntae used the 1st Forbidden skill and immediately overpowered Eli, defeating him. Eli noticed at that moment Euntae's speed, destructive power, and all other physical aspects doubled. Unlike Daniel when using
Ultra Instinct
in his second body, he loses all control and becomes a fighting machine, Euntae maintains his sanity while using
Runner's High.
By the Busan arc the power of Runner high further developed making Vasco a literal beast he fought with King of Incheon alongside Allied crew and his strikes and hits became so powerful that it made the King of Incheon take up his guard to defend against Vasco and Allied he also easily devastated the succesors of Busan crew with Vinjin and fought Jinrang without falling down.

Trivia
Euntae is modeled after
Bill Stax
. a South Korean rapper.
Brekdak and most of the characters in the anime pronounce Euntee nickname as "Basco" due to the V sounding like a B while saying it in a Korean accent.
Aside from doing suggested training regiments from Goo, Vasco also attends a gym.
Euntae loves dogs, especially Golden Retrievers.
When
Daniel Park
was taking care of Inu, he really wanted to see her and was excited to see the puppies, he never knew
Jay Hong
was actually taking care of them.
There are at least 5 particular panels that are humorously repeated in which Euntae is shown with a tear streaming down his face with Jace witnessing this and thinking to himself, "Euntae..."
There were a lot of references to
One Punch Man
referencing Euntae
When Euntae asks Joon Goo how he can get stronger, Joon Goo's advice to Euntae is to do one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10 km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3.
Moreover, in the Lee Euntae arc,
Jace
gets angry at the bullies when he sees them after they'd grown up, saying that, because of them, he'd had to train so hard with Euntae he'd almost gotten bald, which is also a Saitama reference.
Another reference is in
Episode 112
, when Euntae tells
Daniel
to go on a diet, he is given a banana to eat in the morning, which also seems to reference the diet Saitama talks about in One Punch Man, Episode 3.
The nickname "Vasco" was given to Euntae because "Vasco" in the universe of the work is a cartoon/comic hero, who fights for justice by protecting the weak.

Relationships
Jace Park
Bum Jae is his best and most trusted friend. Bum Jae helped Euntae get over his fear of needles, by getting tattoos together, and even has a tattoo of his hero-man E.T. (Euntae). The duo is very close with each other and they often work out together.
Bum Jae seems to be a bit protective over Euntae, to the point of installing a lover app to track him and making sure that he does not get hurt or get into a big mess. The reason Bum Jae is so protective over Euntae maybe because he felt that he could never make up for the time he ditched Euntae back in middle school. However, this is not confirmed.
Euntae often asks for his advice either about the Burn Knuckles and even his personal life. Bum Jae is also vice-leader of Burn Knuckles, which shows how much Euntae trusts him. The duo are extremely close and their friendship is admired by many people.
Goo Kim
In the Lee Euntae Arc, when Euntae was being bullied, another boy who was getting bullied was a relative of
Goo Kim
and paid him to beat up the bullies. When Goo Kim arrives, he sees how much the bullies had hurt Euntae and says that this time will be free because, with an obvious victim, Goo Kim can do whatever he wants to them.
Euntae asks Goo Kim how he can get stronger, whose advise was to do one hundred push ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10 km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3.
Daniel Park
Euntae first meet Daniel when being harassed during work. When they met again at school Euntae didn't like him at first. Later on, they became closer friends.
Duke Pyeon
Euntae sees himself in Duke as they were both bullied viciously in their youth. Vasco tries to protect Duke from bullies, and he is the reason Vasco hates
Vin Jin

Zack and the Ghost Lady
Mira
and
Zack
bump into Jace and Euntae at school in the evening when Mira goes to retrieve her forgotten cell phone. Euntae clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. It turns out that Euntae and Jace are there because Euntae wants the
Ghost Lady
to grant him a wish so that people will stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Euntae's superstitious ideas, making fun of Euntae, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.
At the classroom,
Jace is
incredulous that
Zack
had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Euntae, but, Euntae, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.
The next morning, Euntae,
Jace
,
Zack
,
Mira
, and
Daniel
go to the storage room to see the signature. When they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane, and Euntae is seen shocked as Zack faints and wets his pants.

Synopsis
Episode 51
Daniel
is training with

Burn Knuckles
and decides to help them out, growing fond of them.
At the workout Daniel asks Jace about Vasco, who he thinks is amazing. Jace wonders if Daniel was bullied and that's why Vasco hangs out with him. He decides to tell him Vasco's backstory.
Episode 52
Jace used to be Vasco's only friend when he was little, because he had a strange personality. In middle school, Jace became friends with the popular kids in class. When a popular senior asks them to smoke, Vasco tells Jace to stay away from them because they are losers. The senior begins to bully Vasco.
Jace tries to stay away from Vasco so he doesn't get hurt, but he is guilty about it. He pretends everything is fine, even when he sees him crying alone. When Vasco stops coming to school, the cool kids call Jace to meet the senior.
Episode 53
When he meets him Jace notices another kid getting bullied, a kid they call "Cicada". The senior tells him to bring Vasco to school or he will take his place. He then draws on his face. Jace asks the kid about Vascoand hears that no matter how hard he was bullied he never cried or surrendered.
Jace goes to visit Vasco and finds he doesn't look very sick. There are bloody napkins on his dresser and he is scared of Jace's pen. He rips off Vasco's blanket and finds curse words and drawings carved into his chest.
Episode 54
Jace starts crying and tells Vasco to apologize. Vasco refuses, saying if he does then he will have lost against his bullies. Jace goes to school and tells them to stop bullying Vasco. They beat him and prepare to carve him when Vasco comes in. He stands up to fight them.
Episode 55
Vasco begins fighting the senior and is severely overpowered, but he continues to fight. They are outmatched and getting beaten when the door slams open.
Goo Kim
walks in with his cousin the Cicada who was bullied by the senior. He paid Goo to beat up the seniors and stop the bullying. Goo spies Vasco's carvings and decides to beat the bullies for free instead.
Episode 56
Goo beats all of the bullies easily and sadistically. Everyone is brought to the principal's office where they decide to drop the matter to avoid police investigation. Vasco asks Goo how he can become stronger and he tells him a ridiculous workout of 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats and a 10 km run every day.
Jace decided to get tattoos to encourage Vasco to cover his. He was still afraid of needles, but less so. He finishes telling the story to Daniel, who is touched. They overhear some bikers in the area and Jace recognizes his old bullies.
Episode 57
The thugs recognize Jace and want to beat him, but they are intimidated by Vasco, who they don't recognize. They take Daniel to the alleyway and ask if he and Jace are friends. Daniel isn't sure but Jace appears and claims him as a friend. The thugs attack him and he beats them easily and tells Daniel to come with him.
During the time the thugs were expelled, Goo met with
Gun
for a partnership test. Both of them passed and began collecting money from the
four crews
. The bullied kid became a bully after the entire incident. Jace and Vasco each get personal tattoos as well; Vasco gets one called "Hero Man" (Jace) and Jace gets one called "ET" (Eun Tae) to remember their best friends.
Notes
The workout Goo gave Vasco is the same one the character Saitama uses in the show

Synopsis
Episode 1
Daniel is forced to pretend to be Pikachu
The story begins with Daniel Park being bullied by Logan Lee in a bathroom. Daniel is fat and poor, so Logan likes to pick on him. He makes him do degrading acts like pretending to be an animal and being his personal ashtray. Daniel puts up with the abuse because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. He takes his aggression out on his mother, who doesn't know he is being bullied.
One day at school Logan places a bet that Daniel cannot avoid his shot but he does. He begins beating Daniel for not listening to him, and Daniel's mother witnesses this.
Episode 2
Daniel says mean things to his mother
Daniel's mother asks him if he's okay and scolds Daniel, embarrassing him. He then furiously yells at his mother, stating that she is embarrassing him and Daniel apologizes to Logan. This secretly makes Daniel feel miserable and he even called himself the 'world's biggest piece of trash'. After school his mother sits him down and confirms she allows him to transfer. Daniel realizes that his mother knew that he was getting bullied but pretended not to know, and he starts crying.
Daniel's new haircut makes him look like Kim Jong-un
Despite feeling guilty, Daniel listens to his mother and decides to start fresh. Daniel finds his new home which turns out to be an old shack. Daniel goes to a hair dresser and has his hair cut to a 'two-block' hairstyle, but he ends up looking like Kim Jong Un.
Zack gets angry while Mira tries to stop him
On his way from the hairdresser he spots Mira Kim looking at him. He thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her. Zack Lee sees Daniel smile at Mira and gets jealous, but Mira prevents him from fighting. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behavior. However, Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Unable to keep his anger under control, Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders take pictures and upload them online.
Daniel's first time looking at his new body in the mirror
That night, Daniel cries himself to sleep because he had gone viral online, and had lost his chance at a new start. When he wakes up, he goes to the bathroom to check his probably tear-swollen eyes and finds that the ceiling and sink look much lower than before. He then finds himself looking very different, with a slim figure and extraordinarily handsome appearance. He stays in utter shock before falling out of the bathroom in confusion and bewilderment, only to find his old body which is found to be sleeping peacefully on the floor.
Episode 3
Daniel slaps his old body in his new body
Daniel, in his new body, ponders on who he should tell about the current situation and he finally decides to rely on himself. He attempts to wake his old body up but after failed attempts, Daniel forcefully wakes his old body up with a harsh slap. He then wakes up in his old body and after a while, he learns that when one body is awake, the other body has to be asleep and that he has to come up with an even schedule. He finally decides to be in his new body during daytime while being in his old body during nighttime.
Daniel attracts attention at school for his beauty
The next day, two schoolgirls are shown commenting on the looks of some of the schoolboys and they compliment practical music student Beom, stating that his dyed hair looks cute. They stop paying attention once they see Daniel, who is even more handsome. A girl, Soojin, even runs in front of him to catch a better glimpse. Daniel, unaware of the expressions of the people, hopes that he doesn't get bullied like he did before.
Episode 4
Jiho is forced to fan his bullies
This Episode starts off in a classroom, where people are casually talking about how time flies so quickly.
Jiho Park
is being bullied by
Doo Lee
and his friends who are forcing him to fan them. The homeroom teacher comes in and tells everyone to be quiet, stating that there's a new transfer student. Daniel enters the room and everyone becomes astounded at his heavenly attractiveness. The girls' hearts race while the boys become slightly alert and jealous of his appearance.
Zoe flirts with Daniel, much to Zack's annoyance
Daniel goes to his assigned seat and tries to make friends with whoever is next to him, so he smiles and greets whoever is next to him. To his shock, Daniel realizes that the person sitting next to him is Zack, the boy who punched him earlier.
Zoe Park
begins flirting with him, and Daniel is confused how to respond. Zack sees Mira staring at Daniel and he becomes jealous of him. The next scene is set in the cafeteria, where Daniel eats with Zoe. He is happy he isn't being bullied, and is unaware of her aggressive protectiveness over him.
Daniel is offered cigarettes
Doo and his friends confront Daniel and tell him to meet them after lunch, which worries Daniel. Surprisingly they offer him a cigarette and say that he should hook them up with girls. Daniel lies to them that he quit smoking (so that he doesn't have to smoke while not making himself look 'uncool') and informs them that he doesn't know any girls. The three other boys, including Doo, feel intimidated and think of Daniel as imposing while he quickly runs off in fear.
Later, Daniel is seen peacefully sleeping with Daniel watching him adoringly. Daniel wakes up in his old body and panics, trying to force himself to sleep. As he wakes up he accidentally swears at Zoe, but this only makes her fall for him even more.
Episode 5
Daniel names many cigar brands
Daniel gets a job at a local convenience store selling cigarettes. While he finds that in his new body, the owner is very willing to hire him, the owner is more reluctant when it comes to his old body.

Synopsis
Episode 163
Jiho
is upset that he is invisible to
Daniel's
friends. He envies Daniel and wishes he could be like him. At an ATM machine he meets
James Gong
, a former classmate in middle school. He lends him money and James tells Jiho he wants to hang out with him. Jiho is scared that James will bully him but James befriends Jiho and invites him out to eat with his friends at a bar.
As Jiho hangs out with James he realizes how much fun it is to be included in a group. To act tough he suggests they trash the bar's owners and James chucks a brick at the car. Jiho realizes James may not be a good friend after all.
Episode 164
Jiho tries to ignore James and his friends but is drawn to them again. He visits them at a pool place they use to hang out. James asks Jiho if he can lend money from him and Jiho offers to make him a bank account. He allows James to make his own password and signs it in his name. Daniel notices that Jiho is not hanging out with him anymore and grows concerned.
As James walks down the road he complains about the amount of money he owes. He notices a sign buying bank accounts. Jiho gets messages from a teenager complaining that he scammed him of a phone purchase he made. The teen confronts him at school and tells him to come outside.
Episode 165
Daniel tells the kid to back off Jiho and Jiho takes him to James. James denies knowing about the account and beats the kid's friends. Jiho gives him his own phone to pay for the loss and worries James forgot about the account.
When Jiho gets to the computer he sees there are multiple scams in his name. He tries to freeze his account but he cannot remember his pin. He goes to the police station but they are closed for the weekend. Jiho sits on the curb and cries, wondering what he will do.
Episode 166
Jiho goes to a cyber café to try and figure out how to stop the scams. He runs into
Doo
and his friends who laugh at Jiho for being in trouble again. Jiho attacks Doo and starts fighting him, and both are stopped by
Zack
. Doo backs off and Jiho asks Zack why he is so kind to him when he never considered him a friend. Zack asks Jiho if he thinks of Zack as a friend, and Jiho doesn't answer.
Zack interrogates Jiho and finds out he was scammed. He tells
Mira
he is leaving with a friend, and goes to find James. They head to the pool place and he beats up the guys at the table. He confronts James and tells him to give Jiho his account back.
Episode 167
James laughs at Zack and tells him his fly is undone. Jiho sees through the trick and protects Zack from James' attack while Zack beats James. James tells Jiho that he sold the account for money and that he can't reach the buyers because they use burner phones.
Zack calls his friends and they gather in the cyber café to help Jiho. Zack finds the emails of the burner phone possessors and gives each person a number of emails to scour through, but they don't find anything.
Kouji
overhears Jiho's situation and realizes he is a friend of
Jay
. He decides to help them to get on Jay's good side.
Episode 168
Kouji explains that the email plan didn't work because emails are anonymous. He tells Jiho that most gamers reuse their usernames and finds the culprit's username "Power Gundam" on a gaming website. He finds the culprit's Naver account and begins searching through their social media until he finds a photo of some darts and a convenience store.
Vasco
runs out of the building at this picture.
Kouji uses the location the picture was taken at to find the hangout of the culprit. They call Vasco but he explains he already found the location of the picture. He finds the
God Dogs
at a dart place and tells them to give him Jiho's bank account.
Episode 169
The God Dogs laugh at Vasco but quickly stop as he destroys them all.
Jin Jang
watches Vasco fight and recognizes him from the photograph as one of Daniel's friends. He fights Vasco and predicts his every move, beating him easily. He says
Johan
will be pleased to know that Vasco came alone.
In a car, Johan is being driven by Gun and Goo after returning from his mother's store. Gun warns him to be careful of Jin because he is known to be a scammer, and that could ruin Johan's chances of being his successor. Johan assures him Jin's scamming days are over, but he is worried about his sadistic tendencies.
Back at the dart place Vasco is severely wounded. Jin prepares to end the fight but he is hit with a low kick out of nowhere. Vasco reveals that he has been training in Muay Thai, and the only reason he didn't use it is because losing is a shameful thing for a student. He stands in preparation for a fight.
Episode 170
Jin Jang tells Vasco to give up and join the God Dogs while he still can. He is worried Johan will find out about the bank account incident, so he tells Vasco to keep it a secret. Vasco ignores Jin and starts fighting him. Jin finds himself severely outmatched by Vasco, who is not only strong but well trained. As Vasco knocks Jin out he tells him the
Burn Knuckles
will never be swallowed by anyone, because they have their own agenda.
Daniel's friends race to the dart place to see Vasco has already handled the situation. They take Jiho's account and return all the money to their owners. Vasco is cheered on by the Burn Knuckles for his bravery and Daniel notices Jiho stopped coming to school.
The 4 crews hear about the incident and become interested in Vasco. Johan visits Jin in the hospital and is told that Vasco beat Jin for trying to recruit him. He is disappointed because Vasco knows Daniel, and he considered Daniel a friend. He tells the God Dogs to prepare for a gang war with J high.
Episode 171
Jiho is upset that he is too weak to do anything for himself. He tries to workout and gets tired easily and remembers how strong his friends are. Just as he is about to give up he spies the pocket knife on the floor next to him and decides he can do something after all. He leaves his house and his mother complains that a friend is waiting for him. Daniel (the friend) is concerned about Jiho.
Jiho visits James at the pool place and slices him with the knife, asking if James thinks he is weak. When he trips on his own legs James replies that he does, and begins hitting Jiho with the pool stick. Daniel holds James back and tells Jiho to run while he can.
Jiho gets upset at Daniel and tells him to mind his business. When Daniel mentions that they are friends Jiho scoffs at him, asking how he can relate to Jiho. Daniel mentions that Jiho is friends with his other body and
Duke
, and they can relate to him. Jiho is triggered and pushes Daniel and James out the window.
Notes
The man asking James to stop peeing in the street is the same old man Johan accused of stealing his dog in the animal cruelty arc

Synopsis
Episode 21
Vin
is a rapper trainee at OK Talent Agency. He is rivals with
Duke

Vin bullies Duke for his appearance and status in society. Duke hears about the festival and how many attractive and talented people will be there. When
Mary
asks who is willing to participate Duke decides to participate against Vin.
Episode 22
Daniel
and
Jiho
is sitting in the cafeteria when Jiho mentions Duke gets bullied a lot. He invited Duke over to sit with him instead of the Vocal kids. Vin gets triggered and asks Duke to get him some water.
Jay
,
Zack
and
Vasco
stand up to defend Duke, and Mary teases Vin about fighting.
Daniel is cleaning the school after class and sings to himself about his loneliness. Duke overhears and asks him to perform. Daniel sees himself in Duke and admires his ambition and strength. He agrees.
Episode 23
At first, Duke is embarrassed to reveal he is poor to Daniel, but Daniel does not care about it. He has a good voice but not that much practice, and he and Duke practice. Daniel practices at his night job and runs into
the pretty girl
, who compliments his voice. He also meets Jiho and Duke, and Jiho apologizes to him.
The three of them sit outside the store and reminisce about their days being bullied. Vasco overhears and asks about Daniel. He learns that Daniel genuinely cares about his friends and feels bad he misjudged him. He tells Daniel he is not weak and he can help him work out. Duke is impressed to see Daniel improved overnight and is confident about the festival.
Episode 24
The festival begins and departments choose candidates for the slave auction, where girls get to date a guy for one day. Daniel is chosen because Zack refused out of his love for
Mira
. The Baking Department and the Architecture Department are doing poorly but the Beauty Department thrives off
Eli Jang's
a massive number of fangirls.
The slave auction begins and the girls start to choose. Vasco is not sold because girls are scared of him, and he cries. Eli Jang is bought by his department who refuses to let any other girls talk to him. The girls begin to fight over Daniel.
Episode 25
Lala Kim is a rich student from a private school. She bids the highest out of anyone in the area, but another girl bids higher than her. She is eventually outbid by the girl, who Daniel recognizes as the pretty girl from the convenience store, whose name is Crystal. He thanks her and she tells him not to look down on people just because he is handsome.
Daniel tries to chase after her but is stopped by
Gun
, her bodyguard. He grabs Daniel but he hits his hand away, surprising Gun. Gun kicks Daniel and decides to beat him. Vasco overhears the confrontation.
Episode 26
Vasco interrupts and tells Gun not to mess with him. Gun hits him in the face but he does not back down. Crystal threatens to tell her father to fire Gun and he decides to let them go. Crystal apologizes for Gun's behavior and tells Daniel to not be a stranger. As she leaves, he notices she looked like she pitied him.
Vasco buckles under the pain he has been hiding and says he cannot beat Gun. Daniel thanks him for helping and is happy that Vasco called him a friend. When the night falls he prepares for his musical performance with Duke.
Episode 27
Daniel is scared to be on stage and is overcome with stage fright. Duke begins rapping and Daniel is reminded of Duke's advice to remember someone he loves. He thinks of his mother and begins singing from the heart. They blow the audience away with their performance.
After the performance, Daniel and Duke are high from the excitement. Vin's manager comes to Daniel and asks him to audition. He rejects Duke because his looks aren't good enough to be in the industry. Duke is even cut out of the official footage of the performance. However, Duke refuses to give up on his career and vows to try harder next time.

Synopsis
Episode 127
Daniel
sits on the bed in the Nurse's Room, thinking deeply about how to avoid
Logan
. He comes to the conclusion that since Logan is in a different class, it won't be difficult to avoid him. Daniel gets up and tries to open the door so he can leave but the door won't budge because Logan is also trying to open it from the other side.
The scene then cuts off to
Vasco
and
Jace
walking down the hallways with the freshmen greeting them with respect. Vasco notices
Leonn
greet him casually. Vasco asks him for his name and the people tell him to speak formally to his senior, Vasco. Leonn states that Vasco promised to fight him in the past. Vasco is still unable to remember and this angers Leonn, who then proceeds to kick Vasco in the shin out of frustration. Vasco collapses and Jace asks Vasco if that Leonn's kick hurt him that much and Vasco says it was Logan's attack that did it. Vasco labels Logan as a 'punk' and comments that he's unbelievably strong.
The scene switches back to Daniel and Logan. Both of them continue to attempt to open the door with unbelievable strength and force and the door finally opens and Daniel accidentally bumps into Logan. Daniel panics, remembering that the two have actually met before and hopes that Logan doesn't recognise him. Logan tells him to piss off and Daniel attempts to leave. Suddenly,
Zoe
holds Daniel's arm and asks him if he's okay.  Remembering his insecurity around handsome guys who always have girls follow them around, he stops Daniel with anger.
A flashback to Logan's past is shown, when he had his first girlfriend. Logan used to date
Mae's
old girlfriend, who liked him because he was strong. She cheated on Logan for a handsome guy, and from that day on Logan hated handsome guys. He also became violent towards women. He grabs Daniel's shoulder and is surprised when he doesn't back down.
Episode 128
Daniel collapses out of fear of Logan Lee. Zoe hits Logan and tells him to stop bullying Daniel, and he calls her a slut. When she remarks that she likes Piggy he is disgusted and walks away. He spies her sitting with fat Daniel and wonders if she is telling the truth before seeing her with the handsome Daniel. He becomes depressed and avoids school.
Jay-Gal
is worried about Logan and visits him. Logan returns to school having lost most of his weight and is now incredibly skinny.
Episode 129
No one believes Logan is in the comics department because he is good looking. He discovers girls find his bad attitude attractive instead of intimidating. He realizes that good looks can be as powerful as strength in influencing others.
Logan decides to go confess to Zoe. He runs into Mira and tries to seduce her but is hit in the face by an angry
Zack
.
Episode 130
Logan tries to fight Zack but he is too weak and loses easily in his skinny form. He challenges
Vin
and gets beat a second time. Vasco tries to help him and looks at him with pity. Even Jay-Gal tries to fight Logan and leaves him bloody.
Logan goes to her classroom and finds Zoe is sick so she didn't come. He looks at Crystal and sees she resembles Daniel. Logan grabs her face and Daniel grabs his hand.
Episode 131
Logan rushes at Daniel and he dodges his attacks, finishing him with a sucker punch. Zoe comes in to see him on the ground and helps him up. Logan asks her to meet him in a store.
At the store, Logan asks Zoe to go out with him. She rejects him for his terrible personality and the way he treated everyone. Logan gets depressed and gains back all the weight he lost.
Cookie 1
Zack
&
Vasco
notice that Logan gained more weight and got bigger, commenting that the Buddha gained more weight, we then see Logan beat Vin in the corridor. We see that
Jay-gal
is glad that Logan went back to his old self and that no one recognized him when he was lost weight. It then cuts to Zack wondering if he can protect
Mira
if Logan tries to hurt her again.
Cookie 2
Zack
taking up boxing again. His boxing coach complains that he took too much time off and mentions Zack used to be a genius when he was younger.

Synopsis
Episode 71
At the cafeteria, the girls stare as
Zack
,
Jay
and
Daniel
walk in. A bunch of girls start gushing over Daniel, causing the classical music kids to get jealous. One of the kids is Beom, a freshman who is a popular online clothing model for the Oh Bok Hee company.
Daniel gets an offer to model for a start-up clothing company called Kian Clothing Company. The salesman doesn't make much but he offers to pay Daniel a good wage. Daniel gets a better offer from a wealthier salesman, making Beom jealous that his boss likes Daniel that much. He decides to think it over.
At night Daniel goes shopping with his mother at the department store. The wealthy salesman discriminates against
Daniel's mother
and laughs with Beom, calling them beggars. In the morning the other modeling company laugh at the poor salesman's rundown equipment. They are shocked to see Daniel emerge from his van.
Episode 72
The other salesman asks Daniel what he is doing and offers him even more to model. Daniel rejects him, saying his clothes look worse. Beom becomes jealous of Daniel, and only grows more jealous when he spots his modeling partner
Joy
becoming interested in Daniel. When her contract ends she models for Daniel's company to spend time with him.
As Daniel is walking home he spots his mother taking food scraps to feed him dinner. He is ashamed of himself and decides to earn money no matter what.

In this post we will refer to all the foreshadowing, we seen till now in lookism
What is foreshadowing?
Foreshadowing
is a narrative device in which a storyteller gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, and it helps develop or subvert the audience's expectations about upcoming events.
Foreshadowing.(1)->GUN MEETING GAPRYONG KIM
in Episode 526 ,We got to know that gun meets gapryong kim when he first comes to korea.
File:Screenshot 2024-11-01 160949.png
gun refering to jake reminding him of somebody
This was foreshadowed by gun already in
episode 310
Foreshadowing.2->

--- FILE: Four_Major_Crews.txt ---
Seoul, the land where
monsters
fight.
The
Four
Major Crews
are the four biggest gangs in Seoul divided by the Han River into five regions: North, West, East, and South. 3 years prior to
Daniel
coming to Seoul and entering
J High
,
Gun
with the assistance of
Goo
under the plan created by the
Ten Geniuses
, would seek out four of the largest pre-established gangs in order to turn them into the four major crews, each tasked to make at least a hundred million won a month. The purpose of these crews was to employ minors to earn money in order to help
Charles Choi
kickstart his business, with the only condition being that they couldn't earn the money through illegal means as that would jeopardize his reputation. 3 out of the 4 crew heads became Gun's successors, with the goal being that one of his successors would unite the four crews under their leadership, earning them immense money and status, but none have been able to do so yet.
3 years into the existence of the Four Major Crews, Charles Choi had become a pretty influential person in South Korea however he started to get paranoid that his criminal past would come back to bite him later, and the Four Major Crews were no exception. He would try and get rid of all evidence by getting Gun and Goo to denounce the Four Major Crews while catching them in the act of illegal practices, buying out businesses that have direct criminal ties to him and even murdering people from his past that posed a threat to his status. However despite his efforts, the last Four of the Major Crews still stands,
Workers
.
History
See article:
2nd Generation
Both Gun and Goo sought successors for their business in the meantime, scouring Seoul for suitable candidates. Eventually Gun had to retire from the business and become Crystal's bodyguard, leaving Goo to collect the money by himself.
Uniting the four crews is a task given by Gun to candidates he considers worthy of becoming his successor. Gun not only makes an insane amount of money, he also has a lot of influence due to his wealth. As a result, many people are vying for his and Goo's position. Gun's only rule for someone to be a successor is that they do not engage in illegal activity, because that may get him into legal trouble. Goo has not given this task to anyone.
Gun's first candidate for the job was
Eli Jang
, but he quit the crew business and disqualified himself. His second candidate was
Jake Kim
, but he was disqualified due to the illegal betting ring.
Johan Seong
was the third candidate, disqualified due to poor leadership and fake bank accounts. Gun has since offered candidacy to
Daniel Park
and
Zack Lee
, but both have refused on grounds of principle.
Organization
The Four Major Crews have their own jurisdictions on all four sides of Seoul, with central Seoul remaining neutral. Each gang is responsible for paying a Hundred Million won (86,000 USD) as a monthly fee. While they were encouraged to earn their money through legal methods, illegal methods were expected and quietly allowed as long as they weren't caught. The four crews are divided as follows.
Central Seoul:
Burn Knuckles
,
J High School
, and
Allied
While they aren't considered part of the Four Major; Burn Knuckles, and J High were considered a big threat enough to keep the Four Major crews from taking over Central Seoul completely.
The Burn Knuckles was founded by
Vasco
during his first year in high school, he would go around grabbing delinquents with his shoulder grip, warning them to stop smoking. The delinquents were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department in order to join him, eventually forming the Burn Knuckles. Vasco would indirectly recruit all potential delinquents who could have joined any of the four major crews and would transform them into protectors of the weak. They would protect Central Seoul from foreign gangs, thus keeping Central Seoul in neutral territory.
Due to the number of students who know martial arts, J High School would occasionally aid Burn Knuckles in their fight against the Four Major Crews. Unlike Burn Knuckles, the fighters from J High are not organized and only get involved when they personally get caught in the crossfire. While members like Big Daniel and Zack were always ready to jump into conflict when their friends were in danger, members like Vin Jin and Logan would only join the fight if it personally benefitted them. The only time J High would truly be untied was in their battle against
Hostel A
.
With the end of the
Hunt for Big Deal
and the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the Four Major Crews, Little Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers continue to grow in power and finally decided to create an organized force to combat them, a crew. He founded Allied with only one goal, the collapse and eventual eradication of Workers. When the group was formed, he approached multiple people to join his cause.
Vasco
quickly accepted the offer, bringing alongside the tactician
Jace Park
and the manpower of
Burn Knuckles
.
Zack Lee
, fresh from being trained at the Buddhist temple, joined alongside Vasco.
Jay Hong
joined the group to assist Little Daniel in finding the Big Daniel and
Hudson Ahn
joined in order to confront and get revenge on
Eli Jang
. These were the original five members and eventually more people would join.
North:
God Dog
(Gangbuk)
Before Johan entered the picture, the Gangbuk region was ruled over by
K-House
, a crew run by
Jin Jang
whose main business is fake bank accounts. They would rule undisturbed until
Johan Seong
appeared, he wanted to rule over this region to impress Gun and become his successor. It was the only way to get on
Charles Choi's
good side and get his mom her surgery. He defeated every grew in Gangbuk by himself and K-house was no different. After his takeover, he would change its name to God Dog, creating a new crew out of the collection of various Gangbuk crews he defeated in the past.
This was the second of the Four Major Crews Burn Knuckles and J High came face to face with and by far God Dog was the weakest, while they had the manpower, the crew had weak leadership. No one saw Johan as their leader but they still followed his orders as he maintained his leadership through fear and intimidation.
Jin Jang
would become second in command and was responsible for collecting the money and maintaining the headcount of the God Dogs. He would look loyal to Johan on the outside but behind closed doors he would use this position of power to create a coup of people who wanted to overthrow Johan as they hated being under his leadership, this coup would mainly contain members of K-House who wanted to be their own separate gang once again.
Johan would try and stop his gang from earning money through scams, as illegal activity would ruin his chances as
Gun
's successor. This would be God Dog's downfall as during the climax of the
God Dog Arc
, the problems of poor leadership would finally shine through. The moment he commands his men to fight Burn Knuckles, he is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. While Burn Knuckles and J High are shocked, God Dog laughs at Johan in his weak state. He asks his crew why they betrayed him, and Jin explains that they never liked him to start with. They only they waited this long just to get revenge on the Burn Knuckles and now they didn't need him anymore.  They try and cripple Johan, but he gets up quickly and starts to absolutely sherd his old crew, claiming that he would destroy the God Dogs and the Burn Knuckles and make a new crew. Before he gets a chance to beat down Jin, Gun comes out of the shadows and tells Johan that he is disqualified from the Four Major Crews and his successor due to his poor leadership. Not only was he unable to stop them from continuing illegal business but there wasn't any trust and could have turned on him at any moment. Johan begs Gun to reconsider but Gun refuses to, telling Johan he had his chance. As Johan starts crying for his mother and Gun warns him not to turn out like Jake, but like he did in the past, Johan becomes desperate and decides to fight Gun.  During the fight, Gun notices how much Johan has improved, with his only weakness being that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with one punch.
As Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him, He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out of the way by Zack. While the J high trio stepped in to protect Johan from Gun, Johan didn't have any interest in thanking them and disappeared. Since then, most former members returned to
K House
, some tried joining Big Deal and some joined
Hostel
A. Eventually, all of them would be absorbed into
Workers
under
Samuel Seo
's Fourth Affiliate. Johan Seong still calls himself a God Dog, although some say that he was the only God Dog to exist as he was the only one who believed in his ideals. After the gang's collapse, he refused the position of being the Ruler of Gangbuk, without being a successor of Gun, ruling over it would be pointless. This makes Gangbuk the only region in Seoul that is not ruled over by an overarching gang, due to this empty position, most small gangs that went into hiding due to Johan now came out of the shadows trying to get leadership to rule over Gangbuk. This conflict would escalate all the way into becoming another PTJ comic,
Questism
.
West:
Big Deal
(Gangseo)
Big Deal is most likely the oldest of the four major crews as it has a history in Gangseo with multiple heads. Not much is known about their origins but they were seen as just another gang, that was until "The Boy of Promise"  Sinu Han joined the gang. Due to his dedication and devotion to protecting the street that took him in, he joined
Big Deal
in order to rise up the ranks and become the new "Big Boss" and use the gang to protect the street. He would eventually accomplish that and took over the gang, he would make some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.
Their main business is an illegal betting ring. Jake's actions in the illegal betting arc led to him being locked up at a juvenile detention center, along with many other important members of Big Deal, but they were eventually released later on in the story.

East:
Hostel
(Gangdong)
Originally Back-Door was supposed to be the crew running in the East, but after
Darius Hong
, the head of the crew, was defeated by
Eli Jang
, Gun changed his mind about them and made Hostel into a crew instead.
At the time of Chapter 149 Hostel was in the middle of a major makeover, but they were considered "the worst criminals".
Eli Jang
used to be the head of the Hostel and was considered one of the top candidates to be Jong Gun's successor.

Their main operation involve the runaway fams.
South:
Workers
(Gangnam)
The Workers was originally described by Jace as "beyond a teenage level," and they are seen as more of "an enterprise than a crew." They are known to be hard to locate, as they dress like a typical professional person.
The Workers Head Chairman is
Eugene
who was scouted by
Goo
.
[
4
]
Workers is composed of 4 Branches:
4th Affiliate lead by
Alexander Hwang
and executive
Samuel Seo
; earns money through online illegal streaming;
3rd Affiliate with
Vivi
as the head and several executives, including
Xiaolong
; they sell drugs at their club.
2nd Affiliate has
Neko
(Mitsuki) as its president. They run a circus where they force criminals to play gruesome games where an audience bet on the players. They used to run a fighting den prior.
1st Affiliate has
Hangyeoul Baek
as its president. They have Plastic Surgery in Gangnam as it's business and currently Reinforced by
White Tiger Job Centre
, Workers 5th Affiliate and more. Other Information still unknown but they are probably protecting
Jinyoung Park
against the people who want to get him and he's considered as
Charles Choi's
weakness.
Synopsis
The 4 crews were first mentioned by
DG
, who told
Daniel Park
that if he united the four crews he would tell him the secret of his bodies.
[

]
Since Daniel did not know who or what the Four Major Crews meant, he looked to
Jace Park
for advice since he "seemed like [he]'d know about that".
[

]
Webtoon,
When Daniel Park asked Jace for information,
Jace Park
said that there are two rumors surrounding the Four Major Crews: the first being that one person is behind the whole creation of the Four Major Crews. The second rumor is that each crew has their own illegal business operation.
[

Also the 4 crews do want to take Seoul in as territory to expand.

“
I mean, from a woman's perspective, Gapryong was the worst piece of shit ever... but he could be never pass by someone in need or ignore any kind of injustice.
”
— Minseon Kang about Gapryong,
Ep. 311
Gapryong Kim
is the father of two distant children and presumably more, including
Jake Kim
and
Kitae Kim
, and is the boss of Gapryong's Fist. He left the fist to pursue politics, an endeavor he never succeeded in before he died. He is the most influential member of the Pre-Generation.
Appearance
Gapryong Kim possessed an exceptionally imposing and well-developed physique, characterized by a powerful and athletic build. His musculature was highly defined, with broad shoulders, a wide chest, and a pronounced V-taper created by an expansive back and a narrow waist. The structure of his back muscles was particularly remarkable — densely layered and deeply contoured, suggesting not only years of physical conditioning but also extensive real-world combat experience. His arms were thick and muscular, with visible vascularity and strength-oriented development, indicating both raw power and practical functionality. He was frequently depicted wearing gloves, underscoring his association with hand-to-hand combat and further reinforcing his image as a physical enforcer. Even in formal attire, his strength remained apparent — tailored suits clung to a frame built not for show, but for dominance and resilience. Facially, Gapryong Kim bore sharp, chiseled features and a commanding expression that exuded confidence and authority. His eldest son, Kitae, is noted to be a direct reflection of Gapryong in his prime, while Jake Kim is said to resemble his father almost identically during his younger years.
Personality
He was playful, loyal, and protective of the weak. However, he was very flirtatious and had many children besides Jake Kim, leading to resentment from his partners. Gapryong's personality was a blend of stoicism, charisma, and a deep sense of justice. He was known to be reserved yet commanding, often inspiring loyalty without demanding it. His actions were guided by a strong moral compass, and he was willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. As much as Kim Gapryong is seen as a person who does not tolerate no kind of injustice, proving his kindness. According to
Minseon Kang
, When she was talking to
Jake Kim
, She claimed that Gapryong had two sides, a good and a bad one, when she was referring to both her son Jake, and his son who represented his evil side,
Kitae Kim
. In other words, even though gapryong is a fair and kind person, he probably has a perverse personality like Kitae's, which has not yet been introduced. Analyses of Gapryong Kim's character suggest he aligns with the ISTJ personality type, characterized by a strong sense of duty, practicality, and reliability. This assessment reflects his methodical approach to leadership and his unwavering commitment to his principles.
Synopsis
Backstory
He was a renowned criminal who worked with three of his closest members. However, after accomplishing a goal, he gave up being a mobster and sought to enter politics, but he kept failing until he passed away. The rest of his men broke away, formed their own crews, and started fighting one another. Gapryong Kim was a legendary figure in the Korean underworld and the central force behind the Pre-Generation, also known as the 0th Generation. Revered for his unmatched strength and feared leadership, he unified Korea's criminal world under his rule during his peak, which is estimated to have occurred around 25 to 30 years before the main events of
Lookism
. This timeline is supported by the ages of his sons—Kitae Kim, the eldest at 27, and Jake Kim, the youngest at 19—suggesting that Gapryong's dominance took place in the late 1990s or early 2000s. In Chapter 556, it is stated that he amassed a fortune “almost as much as the entire budget of Seoul city at the time,” placing his estimated net worth in the multi-billion dollar range, a staggering sum that reflected the scale of his control over the criminal world. Although he later failed in his attempt to enter politics, there is no indication that he lost his fortune entirely; in fact, the luxurious lifestyle maintained by Jake Kim and Minseon Kang after his death—including residence in a large mansion—suggests that a significant portion of his wealth may have remained intact or been hidden. His legacy continues to shape the present narrative, particularly through Jake Kim, who carries the weight of his father’s name and influence. Gapryong Kim's legendary status in
Lookism
is further solidified by his confrontation with the Yamazaki Clan, a formidable Yakuza syndicate led by Shingen Yamazaki. This clash occurred during the Pre-Generation era, a time when Gapryong's Fist Gang was at its peak. The Yamazaki Clan, known for their strength and influence, posed a significant threat, but Gapryong's leadership and combat prowess led to their defeat. This victory not only demonstrated his dominance over domestic criminal organizations but also over powerful foreign syndicates. The aftermath of this battle had lasting effects, with Shingen Yamazaki falling into a lethargic state, indicating the profound impact of their encounter. This event underscores Gapryong Kim's unparalleled strength and strategic acumen in the
Lookism
universe.
Fighting Prowess
In
his
fight with
Jichang Kwak
Charles Choi stated that if his hands were his strength, he wouldn't have been the second-in-command of the Oth Generation, which indicated that Gapryong Kim's physical strength was much higher than that of
Elite
. Even so, Elite, who past his prime can beat a 1st Gen king with little to no difficulty.  His level of finesse, combined with his superhumanly articulate body, is beyond what any fighter in the series has achieved in the most simplistic of movements, as stated by
Jinyoung Park
. Gapryong Kim is an arguable candidate for the strongest fighter in the series.Taesoo Ma once mentioned that Gapryong (together with Jake and Kitae) were the only people that could block
invisible attacks
from fighters such as Elite, James Lee and Sinu Han.Not much else is known about the legendary dragon Gapryong Kim before the upcoming Cheonliang arc, even though he was the No.1 of his generation, but he had fighters such as Elite, Jinyoung Park and
Tom Lee
to be under him. "Lightning Choi" once asked Gapryong how he was so strong but all that was answered back was overcome (overcome all obstacles). Also, Gapryong was called a master of his 'powers' and the originator of the legendary Kim's bloodline, stating that Jake and his
brother
have 'Unlimited Potential'. Gapryong's fist power was so powerful that even Jinyoung Park, who got the copy ability and all of the experience from the pre-generation, can only copy up to 3 moves from Gapryong.
Quotes
"I Told you. A lie can make a man weaker... But it will make a man with principles stronger" - Gapryong to Beolgu
[

]
Trivia
Gapryong had a vasectomy done under the request of his wife after she had
Jake Kim
, making Jake Gapryong's youngest child..
[
2
]
Can punch hard. His fighting style is said to be so strong that even Jinyoung Park, who was the first copy user since the 0th Generation, could only manage three strikes at best before being fatigued.
During Jinyoung's fight against Tom in the latest chapter, Jinyoung went into a rage state and accused Tom of killing Gapryong, which Tom heavily denies, citing that there's no reason for him to kill Gapryong.
There are many culprits said to be involved in his murder case. Notable ones include James Lee, Kitae Kim and Charles Choi.
It is likely that Gapryong is based on the real-life figure of
Kim Du-han
.

Jake Kim
Gapryong was Jake's father; however, Jake doesn't really take after him due to Gapryong's habit of leaving his wife and Jake alone. He treated his own family unfairly while being fair to others. This is one of the reasons why Jake harbors resentment towards Gapryong.
Kitae Kim

They are assumed to have a strained relationship, causing Kitae to partake in the murder of his own father. He was labelled as "the man who killed his own father". As shown when Kitae met Jake, Kitae harbors complex feelings for his father. As he implied that much like Jake, he harbors resentment for him, but also attachment. As shown where Kitae had collected the items Gapryong had given to his other children. As implied by him, Kitae had killed many of his half siblings after having asked them what they thought of their father, and upon not liking their answers, killed them.

Gentleman
is a member of the
Workers
.
Appearance
Gentleman is a fairly tall man, while he is still a few heads shorter than Gitae Kim. He appears lean and fairly fit. Despite his presumed older age given that he is from the 0th Generation, he looks considerably young. He does give off a "Silver Fox' charm, with his short light blonde hair parted to one side and dark eyes, he compliments his body with a light colored suit and dark colored shoes.
Personality
Gentleman appears to be a formal man with a penchant for being a cognoscente: often seen spraying his cologne on himself whether before or after making a point. He is also mildly laid back or rather indifferent to others, viewing himself as a whole as someone who is "expensive", as well as being someone who does not want to be disappointed.

Fighting Prowess
Gentleman is considered extremely flexible, given that he could do a vertical splits, holding his leg up with ease, having no trouble whatsoever. He also has commendable kick power, as he was able to kick three of the other Generation members present that were being violent at the meeting where Gitae gathered several of the various Crews together. These kicks, either knocked out if not killed the three that were causing a ruckus during the meeting.

The
Ghost Lady
is the nickname for a woman who had their portrait of their face held in a storage room at the end of the school corridor.
Appearance
She has pale skin, short, black hair, and bloodshot eyes with black pupils and red irises. She wears a grey hat and overcoat. While in the portrait, she doesn't seem to have lipstick on, when Zack sees her in the window, she has dark red lips.
Personality
TBS
Relationships
Zack Lee
When Zack was in the storage room, he sees the Ghost Lady. She would have killed him if he hadn't started to pretend to cry. Later, when Zack realizes he had seen her for real, he wets his pants.
Daniel Park
She falls in love with Daniel and can be seen following him around in the end of the story arc.
Synopsis
Zack signing his name on her portrait
Background
Legend goes that the Ghost Lady had married rich when she was alive, but had been chased into the streets on a rainy day right after her children were born. Hence, she haunts the schoolyard when it rains, trying to find her children. If someone who isn't a child looks into her eyes, they will die unless they either cry like a baby or give her a doll. If they give her a doll, the ghost lady would be so glad that she would disappear and grant the person a wish.
Episode 95
Zack
and
Mira
go to the school to pick up Mira's cellphone, they bump into
Vasco
and
Jace
, who were there to find the ghost lady. Vasco wanted to find the ghost lady so she'll grant him a wish so people wouldn't call him stupid anymore. When Zack makes fun of Vasco for believing in ghosts, Jace dares Zack to sign his name on the glass frame surrounding ghost lady's portrait.
When Zack goes to sign his name on the glass frame, he looks into the Ghost Lady's bloodshot eyes. Zack hurriedly signs his name on the glass and leaves. As he runs back to the classroom, he cries like a baby just in case.
The Ghost Lady following Daniel
The next morning, when they go to check if Zack's signature was on the portrait, Zack realizes that the portrait's eyes were closed and that Zack's name was signed on the window, so he had actually seen the ghost and narrowly escaped death by crying out loud when running through the corridor. Frightened, he wets his pants and faints.
In the epilogue, the ghost lady is seen following Daniel around, blushing, and the narrator explains that she has fallen in love.

NEVER BITES BUDDY
God Dog
was one of the
Four Major Crews
. They resided in Gangbuk, north of the Han River. Their leader and only remaining member is
Johan Seong
.
History
God Dog was made from a collection of various crews Johan managed to defeat in the Gangbuk region. After gathering enough members, Johan barged onto the largest crew,
K House
, and took it over by beating their leader
Jin Jang
. Johan had their name changed and thus created a new gang God Dog.
Johan maintained his leadership through fear and intimidation and would do most of the gang's dirty work.
Jin Jang
would become second in command and was responsible for collecting the money and maintaining the headcount of the God Dogs. Johan stopped the gang from earning money through scams, as illegal activity would ruin his chances as
Gun
's successor. However, they didn't care for his input and simply moved their operations to Central Seoul behind Johan's back. Eventually, they betrayed Johan in favor of Jin Jang's leadership, and he was disqualified as a candidate to be Gun's successor.
Since then, most former members returned to
K House
, some tried joining Big Deal and some joined
Hostel
A. Eventually, all of them would be absorbed into
Workers
under
Samuel Seo
's Fourth Affiliate. Johan Seong still calls himself a God Dog, although some say that he was the only God Dog there ever was because he was the only one who believed in his ideals.
Organization
Jin Jang
was the second in command, and his responsibility was organizing the God Dogs. His four subordinates called "Old Boys" (OB) were the elite members of the gang:
Dominic Min
,
Scott Kwon
,
Hope Park
, and
Ivan Park
. There was no other hierarchy involved.

Trivia
The old name of God Dog was teased multiple times in the story but was revealed a lot later
The logo of God Dogs contained images of a dog, cross and 666. The name is also an anagram. It may have been chosen as a reference to Johan's experience in a satanic cult named
Pungsan
.

Synopsis

Jay
attempts to save him but he is swept in the tide. In the end they are saved by the

who ward off fans with their unpopularity. As Daniel returns to the fashion department he is greeted warmly by his classmates. He spies
Jiho's
empty desk and wonders if he can return to normal.
Logan
returns to harass
Zoe
and
Vasco
and
Zack
stand up for her. Daniel tells Logan to keep his promise and he is shocked that he knows about the fight. He leaves in a rage but keeps his promise to leave Zoe alone.
In a karaoke place
Mary
and
Vin
are playing a claw machine game when they are approached by Ivan Park. Other members of
J High
find themselves surrounded by
God Dogs.
Episode 200
The God Dogs begin looking for the Burn Knuckles, and spray paint students who are cleared. Damon Goh of Burn Knuckles spots them and orders them to stop, but the God Dogs laugh at him.
Vin and Mary are hanging out a karaoke place when they are approached by Ivan Park. Vin insults Ivan by saying he hates ugly people, and Ivan states they will get along just fine since he hates handsome ones. Vin attacks Ivan but Ivan flips away and smashes Vin into the claw machine. He tries to take off Vin's glasses using the machine but stops when Mary smashes the lights off. Vin gets up under the cover of the darkness and prepares to fight.
Episode 201
Ivan lunges at Vin but misses him. He tries to spin land but is caught by Vin, who floors him. Ivan removes his clothes to reveal a wrestling uniform, and Mary is thankful she turned out the lights.
Jace
finds Damon in an alley and Damon tells him to spare his yellow duck, which Jace promptly chucks in the air. He runs into Mark Sa of the God Dogs and wonders what to do, since Vasco isn't responding to his calls.
Logan is at a karaoke place with the animation department when he notices a body pillow that resembles Zoe. He punches it in a rage and begins to cry about his heartbreak, but eventually warms up to the pillow. As he is carrying it back to the room he is stopped by Hope Park, who smashes him into the room. The animation department is stunned to see Logan laying on the ground.
Episode 202
Jace and the sophomore Burn Knuckles are bloodied from the fight. Mark Sa attempts to call Vasco and Jace says they won't fight until Vasco gives the call.
Logan is intimidated by Hope, who is a lot bigger than him. He overwhelms Logan and slams him on the ground, causing Jay-Gal to panic. The God Dogs make fun of the animation department and try to step on the body pillow, but Logan places his arm there. Hope kicks off the band-aid and Logan begins to cry. He stands to fight and tells Hope not to disrespect the animation department to cover his embarrassment.
Episode 203
Leonn Lee has started working at a gas station because she wants to be close to Vasco. She has to dress like a girl for her job to attract customers, so Vasco doesn't recognize her yet.
At the karaoke place the animation department is touched by Logan's dedication towards them. Hope Park is a fighter who relies on his strength, so having Logan beat him is unacceptable. He tries to rush Logan but Logan uses his jiujitsu skills to slip past and hold him in a lock. As he passes out he fears that Johan will have to fight a monster.
Back at the gas station Vasco is surrounded by God Dogs, who ask him to wash his car. Vasco agrees to the task, unaware of the implications.
Johan
arrives after
Jin Jang
and asks where to find Vasco.
Episode 204
Ivan Park is surprised to see he is losing to Vin. He tries to tackle him but gets caught in Vin's scissor kick move. Ivan notices Vin's eyes and Vin gets triggered and breaks his legs. Mary is angry at Vin for fighting dirty and leaves him. As Vin is leaving he runs into Logan, and they go to find Johan. In the gas station, Johan starts fighting Vasco.
Episode 205
Johan is surprised to see Vasco won't fight back against him. Vasco explains that he is only fighting to protect his friends, because power exists to protect others. Johan is triggered at this response and beats him viciously, but Vasco doesn't budge. He is angry that he cannot win against Vasco and decides to leave. Jin begins beating Vasco to keep him quiet and doesn't stop until Johan glares at him. Johan confirms that people only listen to power, and walks away fuming.
Jin buys gas and orders Vasco to drink it, using the other Burn Knuckles as hostages. Vasco looks to his peers then opens his mouth, but is stopped by Leonn Lee. Leonn brings the first year Burn Knuckles and shouts that they are not worthy if they cannot protect Vasco. Vasco is moved and realizes he doesn't have to fight on his own. He tells the Burn Knuckles they can begin fighting back, and Jace assembles the sophomores to beat the God Dogs.
Episode 206
The Burn Knuckles quickly recover and mow down the God Dogs. Jace knocks out Mark Sa, who assumed he was the weakest due to his status as an analyst. Jin Jang quickly surrenders to Vasco but he rejects his apology and tells him to stand up for his beating. He thanks Leonn for calling the rest of the crew, as he learned to rely on others.
Zack leaves the boxing ring and remembers a conversation with his coach. His advice was that Zack stop fighting with emotion, and that was the only way to beat his opponents. Zack remembers the coldness Johan showed him during their last fight and wonders if he can fight like that.
He returns to the ring to find Scott Kwon waiting for him. Scott harasses him and asks about Vasco, but he ignores him and starts training. When Scott hits Zack and he does not respond, the coach gives him his gloves, congratulating Zack on controlling himself. Zack puts them on and tells Scott to come to the ring.
Episode 207
Zack begins fighting Scott Kwon and is way too fast for him. As he is backed into a corner he uses his fast lower body to speed past and knock out Scott. As Zack is leaving he mentions he is going to see a friend. Elsewhere on a park bench Johan is conflicted about Vasco's words. He is torn between his old self who was loved and his current self who is powerful. When Daniel approaches him he asks if they are still friends.
Zack is running when he comes across Scott, who wants a rematch. He refuses because they are not in a match, but when Scott is persistent he beats him and his gang. Scott recognizes Zack as second place in the middle school boxing match, and mentions that the first-place winner is his leader, Johan Seong. Elsewhere, Johan asks Daniel to join to God Dogs.
Episode 208
Crystal
is walking by the hair salon when she spots
Eli
with his daughter. Eli is worried she will judge him but she is pleased he is taking responsibility. He is reminded of Heather and asks if Crystal would be willing to watch
Yenna
while he works. Crystal happily agrees, but is robbed by God Dogs in the bathroom.
Eli races to Crystal's aid and ruins the hair of Dominic Min, who chases him angrily. When Dominic finds out Eli is a father he begins harassing him, and brings a cigarette close to Yenna. Eli smashes his face in the wall and warns him to stay away from his daughter before beating all the God Dogs in the room.
Elsewhere,
Goo
and
Gun
discuss Gun's successors. Gun is worried about Johan because Johan doesn't have much experience leading a gang, unlike Jake. Goo asks if he is still hung up on his previous successor, Eli Jang. Crystal is amazed at Eli's fighting skill but Eli grows sad, believing he will never be more than a thug.
Johan explains to Daniel that he sees a lot of himself in Daniel. He offers him a position in God Dog, telling him together they can earn a lot of money. He goes to find the OBs but they are brought to him by Vin, Logan and Vasco in comatose state. The three of them are angry at Johan and decide to fight him.
Episode 209
All the guys stand facing each other, not knowing what to do. Vasco states he will punish them all and they begin fighting each other. Johan interrupts the fight by hitting them all, then tells Daniel to join him. He tells Daniel that money is power, and asks if he has something he wants to protect. A large amount of God Dogs appear behind him, and Logan and Vin team up to fight them.
Vasco attacks Johan and Johan counters with Vasco's own kick. He tries to punch Vasco but his fist is caught by Daniel. Daniel rejects Johan's offer and tells him he looks unstable. He explains that power is useless if you lose what you are trying to protect, because that would leave you all alone. Vasco stands by Daniel and the rest of the Burn Knuckles appear to back him up.
Daniel asks Johan to stop the fighting and send his gang home. Johan laughs at Daniel and attacks him, simultaneously holding his friends back. He tells Daniel without power he can't protect anything, and tells his men to fight the Burn Knuckles. He is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. Daniel is shocked as the God Dogs laugh that they waited this long just to attack Johan.
Episode 210
Johan is disoriented from the betrayal. He asks his crew why they betrayed him, and Jin explains that they never liked him to start with. They only put up with Johan to get revenge on the Burn Knuckles and now they didn't need him anymore. They decide to break his arms to cripple him, but he gets up quickly. Johan decides to destroy the God Dogs and the Burn Knuckles and make a new crew.
As Johan fights the God Dogs, Vasco feels pity for Johan. Daniel attempts to help him but Vasco holds him back, claiming he doesn't deserve it. Gun shows up as Johan is about to beat Jin and tells him that he is disqualified for his poor leadership. Johan begs Gun to reconsider but Gun refuses to, telling Johan he had his chance. As Johan starts crying for his mother Gun warns him not turn out like Jake. Johan becomes desperate and decides to fight Gun, and Gun removes his glasses.
Episode 211
Logan and Vin realize they have no reason to be there anymore, but stay to watch the fight. Johan lunges at Gun and begins remembering pieces of his past.
After Johan's mother was taken to rehabilitation he visited her and learned she needed a cornea surgery. He dropped out of school and began stealing expensive shoes from street thugs and reselling them for money. He was approached by Gun in an alleyway, and Gun offered him a position as a head of a crew. Johan took the job and took over Jin Jang's old crew to earn money for Gun. When Johan collected enough money he went to a doctor but learned that his mother was at the bottom of a waiting list. He begged Gun to move her up the list and Gun gave him the task of uniting the four crews.
During the fight Gun notices how much Johan has improved. He can fast enough to hit Gun, and does so multiple times. He is powerful and very skilled, but it is not enough to beat Gun. Gun states that Johan's only weakness is that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with a one punch.
As Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him. He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out the way by Zack. He asks if Johan is okay and Johan stops crying. Gun asks Zack who he is and Zack calls himself Johan's friend.
Episode 212
Zack asks if Gun bullied Johan and Johan is too shocked to reply. Zack attacks Gun and Gun is impressed by his speed and determination. He tries to kick Zack but is stopped by Vasco, who carries a muay thai stance. Daniel attacks Gun with his own moves, and Gun realizes Daniel is just as talented as Johan.
He offers a position to Daniel, but he refuses and declares he will destroy the four crews. Vasco agrees to help, and Gun is impressed by Vasco's leadership and Daniel's natural talent. He offers a position to Zack but Zack sticks up his middle finger, claiming he was too emotional when they fought and he wants a rematch. Gun is pleased with their teamwork and leaves them, saying "ganbare". Zack turns to talk to Johan but he has disappeared again. The only sign he was there is his broken wish bracelet in the sand.
In the epilogue, Goo and Gun visit a restaurant. Goo is berating Gun for getting the car seats wet. He is disappointed Gun failed Johan and asks how he can't keep his successors in line. Seonong spills the food on Gun on accident, and Gun prepares to beat him.
Brekdak
races to save Seonong and Gun recognizes him.
Episode 213
Gun is awed by Brekdak and asks for an autograph, Gun praises him for his Muay Thai matches and laments how sad it was that he never found a student. Brekdak smiles that he already has a
student
and Gun appears to be in a good mood while Goo and Seonong have no idea what is going on.
Cookie 1 is the store owners deciding not to report the damages caused by the God Dog vs. J High fight. Their employees are confused as to why, and it turns out Jay paid them all not to tell.
Cookie 2 is
Jake
deciding to accept Jin's offer to combine God Dogs and Big Deal. They are low on funds, and Jin is good at earning money. Jake is trying to decide who to pick to succeed him when he spots Jiho. He is disappointed, and claims there is no good talent to choose from.
Later, the students of J High write down their goals for their futures. Gordon Park is upset that his department is made of delinquents and idiots. The principal warns him to turn his department around, and he develops a grudge against Vasco, leader of the architecture students.

“
Take Pride in Yourself. That is Something I Realized Far too Late.
”
— Gongseob Ji,
Ep. 424
Gongseob Ji
is a monk and the King of Daegu and a predecessor of
Zack Lee
.
Appearance
Gongseob is a tall, bulky man with pale skin and black hair. His hair is styled into a buzz cut and paired with a short beard. The lobes of his ears are stretched, which conforms to his image as a Buddhist monk, and his eyes are typically closed in a smiling expression.
He dons the clothing of a Korean Buddhist monk, having draped an orange garment over clothes of pale grey. He also wears a Rolex watch, expensive sneakers, and glasses with black frames. A greyish pendant shaped like a Christian cross hangs from a cord around his neck, and he is often seen carrying a moktak in hands, tapping it as a monk would.
The long fabric of Gongseob's religious habit hides his missing right leg, which has been replaced with a prosthetic that appears to be made of a shiny grey metal
[
1
]
.
In a recollection of his past as a king of the first generation, Gongseob had a slimmer build and a clean-shaven face. His head was not shorn, but had hair braided into cornrows, and his ears were pierced. He wore a ring on each pointer finger, and glasses of a design similar to his current ones.
Personality
Gongseob Ji is seemingly religious, crying out to the Buddha as a means of calming himself and claiming to have "left the secular world"
[
2
]
behind. However, it is revealed that he actively participates in the secular, partying with several women at a time
[
3
]
and partaking in strong drink on multiple occasions. There is at least one instance exhibited where he became so inebriated that he began playing his moktak with a bottle of alcohol
[
4
]
. To further disprove his supposed position of monk, Gongseob adorns himself in riches, possessing a varied collection of expensive brand items. He does not engage in any religious practices of significance, being shown to neither devote his time to prayer, nor cleaning his prayer area as a true monk would.
Relationships
Taesoo Ma
Friendly rivalry as they have nicknames for each other and fought a lot in the past (with no stated winner).
DG
Resents him greatly as James dropped a building on him.
Zack Lee
Scammed him at the beginning, but had a change of heart and actually started training him.
Synopsis
Background
Like any other 1st Generation King, he was defeated by James Lee, who also took his leg in the process.
Fighting Prowess
During the First Generation, Gongseob Ji ruled over Daegu, the home of Boxing. His unorthodox style of boxing- the "Boxing of Iron", mainly emphasized on speed and endurance. He was stated to be the fastest in that realm, until he was defeated by James Lee.
After his defeat, he was left with only one leg. Moving around was already a huge inconvenience, considering how his fighting style stemmed from the use of his legs.
As a result, he created a new skill: One Step, One Kill.
One Step, One Kill
Utilising his disadvantage to only be able to take a single step, Gongseob uses this to his advantage to pivot his body and land a devastating counterpunch from any angle. This personifies his moniker: the "Iron Fortress"- a fortress that cannot be approached.

Goo Kim and His Secret Friends (김준구와 비밀친구들)
is a crew formed by Goo Kim, and debuted after the invasion that
Allied
carried out in the
1st Affiliate of Workers
, their objectives are unknown.
Organization
Consisting of
Goo Kim
(as leader) and a group of three individuals that Goo recruited over 4 years, being called by him as "secret friends", these individuals are:
Samuel Seo
, who was the first to be chosen after
Gun Park
dropped him.
Logan Lee
, who was propositioned during the
Runaway Fam Arc
, later dropped out of high school to join him.
Taejin Cheon
, who was chosen under previously unknown circumstances.
Goo Kim also thought about recruiting
Johan Seong
, but decided against it because (according to Goo), Johan is a "mama's boy". As he was subordinate to Samuel Seo, the person who ended up joining was
Alexander Hwang
, who was not formally invited to the group.

Crew Strength
Fighting Capabilities
Goo is one of the most powerful fighters in the series, being able to turn anything into a deadly weapon. The other members of the group are powerful enough to fight most of the fighters in the series and are comparable to members of the 1st Generation. Samuel helped defeat a member of the first generation, Taejin easily defeated Vin Jin after their reunion, and Logan Lee, according to the Allied members, became much stronger, with even Goo recognizing his ability.

"
Remember, Sinu. If you end up fighting him.... Dont give him a chance to fight back!
"
—Jagalchi warning Sinu Han about Goo  in
episode
308
Goo Kim (김준구
Kim Joon Goo
)
is a supporting character and an antagonist in Lookism. He is Charles choi's former bodyguard, the former debt collector and former chief of security of the HNH Group, one of the ten talented individuals raised by the HNH chairman, and one of the three kids trained by
Tom Lee
.
Appearance
Joon Goo is a lean-built man with glasses and dyed blond hair. He is always shown fashionably dressed, in a similar fashion as Jong Gun. Contrary to Gun, Joon Goo dresses in relatively lighter colors, (white and gold) as opposed to Gun's (grey and black). [1]
Personality
Joon Goo's Crazy side
Joon Goo comes across as unpredictable and indifferent. Most of the time, he appears to be an easygoing person, and he even retains this laid-back attitude in battle, even against powerful opponents like Logan, Johan, Gun, Sinu Han, and Daniel. However, beneath this carefree façade, he can be extremely violent and sadistic. This is shown when he tells
Vasco's
bullies that he is a villain, just like them, before viciously striking them in the face with a chair. Tom Lee mentioned that Goo only becomes serious when he is wielding a sword or anything similar.
He has showed a strong interest in money. Joon Goo was eager to make some additional money, even if it meant returning to juvie due to the consequences of his activities. However, in Vasco's
backstory
. Goo recognized that "there is a knife and a victim" and decided to offer his service on the house. This is because he realized that he found violence more satisfying than the money he initially requested. He despises being underestimated and might become enraged when it occurs. He is known to become rather serious when wielding a sword or anything resembling one, and he regards swords with the utmost respect, as evidenced by his telling Robert Choi of the Black Bear Gang never to use a sword again.
He is shown to use the phrase “Holy!” Most likely picked up from hearing
Tom Lee
say it.
Synopsis
Background
Goo fighting Gun.(Flashback)
Several years ago, Jong Gun was sent to challenge Goo in a duel. While the outcome remains uncertain, it was clearly a brutal battle, leaving both men with serious injuries. After the fight, they joined forces in the debt collection business and amassed 20 billion won. It is revealed that later on Goo fought
Gun
again because Gun left Goo in the debt collecting business to guard
Crystal Choi
, again the fight outcome remains unclear but it is confirmed that Goo was indeed the one who gave Gun the scar between his eyes, whereas Gun caused Goo to need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments.
Before the events of Lookism, Goo Kim was seen in the Manager Kim webtoon to be a bounty hunter, being given the title of "Lunatic" by Zu Pengguan, a major character in the series, hunting down the bounty on Tian Wai Tian's last successor.
Fighting Prowess
Serious Goo
Goo is a highly skilled combatant and one of the strongest fighters in the PTJ-verse. While his full range of abilities remains unknown, it is clear that he possesses exceptional strength, as he is on par with
Jong Gun
. However, unlike his partner, Joon Goo excels at turning any object he picks up into a weapon. Despite this, his raw strength and stamina are remarkable, as seen when he shattered three camera stands in
108
and endured a relentless assault from Johan Seong in chapter
263
. When wielding a sword or anything similar, he becomes significantly more serious, dropping his usual playful demeanor. He possesses incredible durability, which is evident in every battle. At the beginning of a fight, he often takes numerous hits—though it’s possible he does this intentionally. Once Goo picks any object or weapon up, the outcome of the fight is almost always determined, regardless of his opponent. His fight with Johan Seong was already determined when he picked up a piece of wooden lumber. Another display of his skills is when he defeats
Sinu Han
just by using a chopstick after sharpening it.
Goo brandishing his watch against Jincheol
He is also shown taking out hundreds of experienced weaponized adults when he was 16 alongside
Gun
(who was also 16) in chapter
310
. He is the heir to the Korean sword, which leads him to finally act seriously when wielding the weapon. It is possible he was trained in Kumdo (A proficient sword art of Korea) and Kendo. It is also possible that he is trained in Fencing, Iaido, Eskrima, Silat, and other Weapon-based martial arts; which would explain his specialization in weapons usage and extreme physical capabilities.
Nitoryu (Twin-Sword technique)
Goo Kim's Twin-Sword Technique
Goo Kim is able to wield a sword so skillfully that he is able to use two of them in the same instant, further allowing him to deal maximum damage and use a technique called "Moonlight" which comprises of 3 phases that aim to kill the opponent.
First Sword: First Moon
Goo dashes forward at high speed and stabs in its direction with one sword, aiming to target the torso.
Second Sword: Crescent Moon
Goo uses both his swords to swing diagonally, cutting everything in its path.
Third Sword: Full Moon
Goo uses both swords to release a flurry of slashes in all directions, slicing everything and anything.
Zero Sword: Eclipse
In a last ditch attempt, Goo intentionally lets the opponent flank him and stab both himself and his opponent at the same time, ensuring that he gets pierced through the left of his chest, avoiding any major organs while piercing through the heart of the opponent who is attacking from behind.
Unarmed Combat
Goo Kim's abilities when unarmed are unknown, due to his habit of getting hit and not fighting seriously when he doesn't have a weapon. So it's almost impossible to say how strong he is. In episode 97 of the
Manager Kim
webtoon, Goo is shown fighting against Park Jincheol (A major character of the series, bearing the alias of "God of War"), being able to dodge his attacks, take hits and being able to land a clean hit in return, showing that he can hold his own even without using a weapon.
Quotes
"He doesn't have a serious bone in his body."
Tom Lee speaking about Goo
[

]
"THIS SHIT IS SO CRINGE!"
Goo Kim loathing himself after he made his "sword can be anything" monologue
[chapter 473]
"The moon keeps rising."
Trivia
Goo's exact fighting style has not been revealed, unlike most notable fighters in the series.
He is the "Heir of the Korean Sword".
He has asked several characters to be "secret friends" with him:
The first of his secret friends is
Cheon Taejin
, of Workers' 1st affiliate, and the last being
Logan Lee
, who dropped out of school just to be with him(most probably to laze off and earn money at it).
Goo considered Johan at first but decided against it because he is a "momma's boy".
There are currently 5 members of
Goo Kim's Secret Friends
.
He usually takes in these members after his partner, Gun Park has dropped them.
They are affiliated with
Gitae Kim
.
He is one of the five VVIPs of Workers and has a black badge.
[
6
]
He hates smoking and tattoos. He also believes "a body should be soft and smooth".
Some of the non-weapon objects, he utilizes (chopsticks and a wooden plank) seem to resemble swords.
The official Japanese game information itself states, that Goo's height is
191cm
[
4
]
.
Goo Kim has been named by the author as a member of the 1.5th generation, a group of fighters who rose before the 2nd generation, but after the 1st generation.
[
7
]
Goo Kim has been described as one of the "Three Lunatics" by Zu Pengguan in
Manager Kim
episode 98.
It's implied that Goo's fighting style is likely to be a superior form of Arnis, due to Logan Lee comparing him to Jay Hong when they were fighting him.
He is even trained in martial arts like Kendo, Iaijutsu, Kenjutsu, Iaido, Jōdō, Bōjutsu and even Sōjutsu. These martial arts are not much known but his mastery in these incredibly rare swordsmanship skills is what makes him a feared opponent when he actually gets a sword (katana).
Goo is shown to be wearing Gun's clothes on several occasions like the iconic Yellow button-up shirt or the Black suit which he wore in the 1st affiliate arc. This is even confirmed when he told Jincheol Park in
Manager Kim
episode 100, that he cannot let him ruin the suit as he borrowed it, from  a hot headed bastard (Gun).
He is a sadist as shown when he enjoys violence and brutally beating up perpetrators/bullies just because it's fun.
He loves money.
He loves branded goods.

Jong Gun
Jong Gun is Joon Goo's partner and rival. They are seen fighting on multiple occasions. During the Illegal Gambling Arc, Kim Gi Myung (Jake Kim) states that they (Goo and Gun) are a team that makes around 5 million a year. However, since Jong Gun was hired by the HNH chairman to protect Choi Soo Jung, Gun stopped collecting debts, leaving Joon Goo to do the job all by himself. This infuriates Joon Goo frequently. It is also confirmed during the God Dog Arc that Goo was the one who gave Gun the scar stretching from his right eye to his left.
Charles Choi
Joon Goo is one of the ten "geniuses" raised by the HNH chairman. Joon Goo works for the chairman and follows his orders.
Euntae Lee
Goo had met Vasco in previous years. He knows that Vasco was the kid who has been bullied before, along with Goo's cousin, Maemi. While Vasco was being bullied, Goo shows up and was hired by his cousin to beat the bullies. Vasco, seeing Goo's ability to easily beat the bullies, was impressed and wanted to be strong like him. However, it seems that Goo is not interested and instead gives a perfunctory answer, suggesting 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and running 10 km every day (a reference from the One Punch Man manga). When Goo meets Vasco again during the PTJ Entertainment case, he is surprised that Vasco actually did what he was told when it was just a reference he took from a comic book.
Logan Lee
Logan is one of Goo's secret friends. It may be a possibility that he is Goo's successor as he was seen with Goo in Goo's car, also had a fight with him.
Eugene
Goo introduced Eugene to Charles Choi several years prior to the series. They appear to have already known each other. Goo supported Eugene in his goals for the Workers crew and continues to do so.
Samuel Seo
Samuel is one of Goo's four "secret friends". He earned Goo's approval while seeking Gun's in Chapter 316 after defeating Johan, Olly and Jake in combat.
Goo values him greatly, even choosing to turn on the Workers when Samuel was punished for leaking information to Jake Kim in
The Hunt for Big Deal
. In Episode 472, he went so far as to invade the Grimm Surgery Clinic in order to secure Samuel, challenging the infamous
No. 1
in the process.

Background
Goo was in juvie for an unknown amount of time before being released. He was challenged and then recruited by Jong Gun to work for Charles Choi and became one of the ten geniuses. He had met Eugene prior to meeting Gun and Charles Choi.
Lee Euntae Arc
Goo is first introduced in this arc. Vasco, Jace, and the "Cicada", 3 classmates, are repeatedly bullied by their seniors for their looks and social reputations. The "Cicada" invites Goo to beat their bullies up for a total of 3,000 dollars. However, Goo lowers the price when he sees the horrific tattoos the bullies have inflicted upon Vasco. He stated that he could beat the bully to his heart's content, without receiving punishment. knock all 3 guys out with ease and later tells Vasco a "training regimen" before leaving. Later, Gun is seen meeting Goo for the first time, with orders of a test from the HNH chairman.
PTJ Entertainment Arc
Under the HNH chairman's instructions, Goo and Gun beat up a large group of men without much effort. However, Goo gets aggravated when Gun brings up Goo's card debt collecting job. The two engage in a chaotic fight. Later, the HNH chairman arrives to speak with the PTJ company CEO, who was involved in the Aru scandal.
Stalker Arc
Goo is seen harassing Logan Lee after his refusal to offer money to Gun.
God Dog Arc
Goo is seen relaxing on a pool chair while Gun stretches on a diving block. Multiple scars can be seen stretching across Gun's back, and it is possible that Goo was the one who inflicted them, although it may also have been caused by another character. The two partners are talking to
Johan Seong
, who begs Gun to tell the HNH chairman to move his mother up the waiting list for her cornea surgery. However, Gun refuses, repeatedly reminding Johan to complete his task and claim Gun's position as successor. Goo offers an alternative, which involved an immediate payment of a ridiculous amount of $10 million won as a deposit (implying more payments in the future).
Runaway Fam Arc
Goo confronts Logan Lee and asks him to meet with him. He reveals that he wants to be secret friends with Logan, but Logan refuses to consider Goo's offer and tells him to fuck off.
One Night Arc
Goo is sent by the HNH chairman to deal with Johan Seong, who is pestering him. He kicks his money out of his hands and steps on it, causing Johan to get angry and attack him.

He then beats him unconscious with a stick, saying he believes Johan has the potential to beat Gun eventually.

Daniel, who earned the VVIP status by working as a black badge, appears to be sitting in a chair when he enters Seo Sung-Eun's room. greet with ungrateful grace.
Later, he talks with Daniel and is surprised to hear that Gun gave Daniel a black badge. While talking behind Gun's back, he suddenly smiles and asks him to get rid of the four crew members instead of him. When Daniel asked what it was and said that he couldn't even touch him because of what Workers were holding, he said, "If you be my secret friend, I'd let you know." And if Daniel comes, he said, "There are four of us." When Daniel lied, saying, "I'm Gun's successor," Daniel said, "Unlike Gun, I'm not obsessed with him," and smiled and fainted Daniel in a flash. Then he leaves, saying he will leave a gift for Samuel.
He appears at the construction site with Charles Choi's order. Wearing a helmet, lifting a shovel to dig the ground, the movie says, "You only call these places when you bury traitors." When Charles Choi quietly scolded Goo, saying, "I heard someone told me to watch out for my illegal activities," he sarcastically said, "When other crew members were involved in illegal activities, why did you call me when they were in charge of the four-men crew members?" "When other crew members were involved in the illegal work, they stayed still." Then his expression gets serious and he asks if there is any weakness in the Workers. Charles Choi then muttered, "This is why he shouldn't have left until he had complete control of them," and said, "Who's here?"
Lee Do-gyu, the director of Baekho Human Resources Center, appears in front of Goo with a touch, and Goo seems to be intimidated and ready to fight with a heated shovel.
Although the battle was likely to take place, Goo first said he was disappointed by Charles Choi, saying, "The jurisdiction of the four crew members is over, but why to call himself that Workers was caught committing an illegal act?" He said, "I am your bodyguard." Then, he called in a retired uncle who couldn't take care of his allowance, but asked if he suspected him, and mentioned that Charles Choi had a fought well when he was younger, threatening him with a "Shall three of us should fight each other."
However, Charles Choi, who soon gives a 100-million-dollar check as pocket money, looks surprised, but when he says that he was playing too much and tried to take care of him, he looks suspicious. What he said to himself earlier is that he took a check from Charles Choi, who is said to have been surprised, and says that it is rather surprising that Charles Choi, the world's leading figure, is reluctant to Workers. "Be careful with Lee Do-gyu, who takes out alcohol," he warned, "I'll pluck your eyes when I meet you next time."

“
Funny... there was a man who messed with my shades before but no one has ever messed with my hair.
”
— Gun Park,
Ep. 243
Gun Park
(박종건 Park Jong Geon)
is a major antagonist in
Lookism
. He is a fighter of legendary status and the former personal bodyguard of the HNH Chairman's daughter,
Crystal Choi
. He was also one of the "10 Geniuses" raised by
Charles Choi
, as well as being the heir to the
Yamazaki Syndicate
in Japan, earning the title of White Ghost.
Ryu Seung-gon
voices Gun in the
Lookism
animated series.
Kent Itō
voices Gun in the Japanese
Lookism
mobile game.
Appearance
Gun is a very tall and lean-yet-muscular young man who is always dressed well, usually donning colors of dark fashion and designer brands. His hair is shaved on the sides but long on top, and has always been seen with it slicked back.
He is usually seen wearing full-rimmed glasses to hide the scar stretching between his eyes. Gun's facial appearance changes drastically when he takes off his glasses. He has many scars across his body, and tattoos on his arms. On his chest is a long, horizontal scar given by Eli Jang.
[
6
]
He also has a scar given by Jerry Kwon.
[
7
]
Gun's most distinguishing trait is his pitch black eyes with white irises, a result of him being constantly in the state of Ultra Instinct.
Personality
Gun is usually seen as a highly composed individual who is quite dedicated to his job as a bodyguard. He maintains a stern-looking expression on his face that exhibits a smile only when amused, usually by someone's fighting potential. This was most likely picked up from
Tom Lee
, who raised/trained him throughout his childhood, like his partner and rival
Goo Kim
, he is merciless when agitated and fighting—as seen during his fight with
Jake
. Gun stated he would knock out all of Jake's teeth, which he indeed ending up doing without much trouble. Unlike
Goo
Kim, Gun will remove his glasses when he's about to exhibit his demonic side, causing many to refer to him as a 'Monster'.
Gun is stated to be a "pervert" with whom gender is of no concern for his attraction by Goo. The nebulous nature of Goo's statement could refer to literal sexual attraction or a more idiosyncratic "attraction" to strong fighters.
Educational ability
Gun is both an exceptional fighter and a top-tier coach, earning him the title of "Nurture Genius". He is able to turn talentless fighters such as Olly Wang and Eli Jang into monstrous fighters in a short period of time, showcasing his educational ability. He also trained Daniel Park for one month, allowing him to completely overwhelm the Workers and prevent the destruction of Big Deal street.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Ultra Instinct
Gun has been shown consistently since the beginning to be one of the strongest characters throughout the series, and even across the entire PTJ verse. He has mastered various martial arts and skillfully integrates all of them into his all-out fighting style. His most commonly used attacks come from Yamazaki-Style Kyoukushin Karate (a collection of Kyoukushin Karate arts from all across Japan). He prefers to fight unarmed (though he is adept in using weapons such as Tonfas and Stun Batons), and tank blows head on rather than dodging them.
As stated by Charles Choi, his strength is "impossible to capture", and he is a Genius who would never stop growing stronger. This is due to the fact that he is always conscious in the Ultra Instinct state, allowing him to amp his senses and physical capabilities to the max every second, making him stronger than ever after every successive fight.
He was able to tank a constant onslaught of attacks from Jerry Kwon, Warren Chae, Zack Lee and Vasco- all at their strongest, and then knock em all out near-effortlessly with little to no damage sustained.
In the earlier part of Lookism, he triumphs over the entirety of the
2nd Generation
with his strength, as none of them had been able to damage Gun seriously. This was so until the 2nd Generation got stronger.
In the Hunt For Big Deal arc, his mere presence alone was able to paralyze the majority of the Workers in fear. He then proceeds to defeat
Mandeok Bang
,
Yuseong
,
Ryuhei
and
Magami Kenta
all alone, sustaining no damage.
Later in the Hunt For Gun arc, he fought off thousands of Workers and Kagiroi with no damage, and later the Four Major Crews and their strongest fighters such as
Jake Kim
, Eli Jang, Johan Seong and Mandeok Bang. Though sustaining a broken arm, deep lacerations on his torso, with his chest caved in, one eye rendered functionally useless and pummeled into a crater on the ground, he was still able to overwhelm all of them.
When adrenaline pumps through Gun's blood, he becomes stronger than ever. It makes him unable to feel pain- allowing him to use a completely broken arm as if it were never destroyed in the first place. While fighting Johan Seong who regained his vision, he was able to tank all blows inspite of getting injured from previous fights from the crew heads.
And while fighting Goo Kim, even though getting pushed back and being on the defensive, he was still able to contend with the Weapon Genius until Charles Choi's safety was compromised by James Lee, at which point his attention wavers and Goo inflicts a deep slash on his neck, which could fell any other man. Which is another testament to his blatantly superhuman endurance and will to fight.
Eventually, due to losing consciousness, Gun's body enters the unbridled 'Ultra Instinct' state, something which is implied by both Goo's and James Lee's statements, to in fact be his true nature by blood. In this form, Gun's prowess ascends to such a level that he outright outmaneuvers and overpowers even a fighter of Goo's calibre into a knockout, even when the latter had already unleashed his own full power using his 'Twin Swords Stance' and got more serious than he's ever been for a fight.
Gun being the 'Nurture Genius', also mean that he sees martial arts and fighting as a whole like an academic subject. Hence he's also privy to their tactics, strategies and weaknesses as well, especially of his students. He is in fact so knowledgeable and intuitive about all things combat, that even after being at the most weakest and physically mangled state he's ever shown to be in whilst simultaneously overwhelmed by the pain of all the injuries he incurred throughout the arc, he still tactfully overpowers 2nd Body Daniel Park, whilst the latter is in Ultra Instinct himself, capitalizing on the latter's tendency to match opponents, and eventually pummel him into total inactivity, the first person in the series to achieve such a colossal feat, though that last effort took everything out of him and left him near death.
All of this truly cements him as one of the absolute most powerful and complete, hand-to-hand fighting forces ever seen, and will be as such for the far future.

He rips his shirt off whenever he gets serious during a fight.
He is very good at video games.
Gun has a strict level of morality/rules to himself and his successor such as not being involved in any illegal activities.
Previous candidates: Johan, Jake, Olly, Samuel and Eli
Potential Candiates/Succesors: Daniel Park

Goo Kim
,
Jake Kim
, Daniel (in an unconscious state), DG/James Lee, Gapryong Kim, Elite/Charles Choi, Jinyoung Park, Baekho Kwon, Jake Kim's Older Half brother (King of Seoul), Jichang Kwak (stated by Daniel to be on par in terms of brute force and Elite/Charles Choi even considered Jichang worthy of replacing either Goo or Gun) and Tom Lee.
He appears to have a history in Japan and is recognized by the Yakuza as "White Ghost".
Gun is implied to be Pansexual.
Goo has stated that Gun is a "pervert" who doesn't concern himself with the gender of the person he is attracted to or "hooked" on.
Gun rewards Daniel with a clue to taking down the Workers after Daniel "pleases him with his body" (Daniel fought Gun).
He has poor handwriting.
[

He always wears branded clothes.
The official Japanese game information itself stated the height is 190cm

Gun Park has been named by the author as a member of the 1.5th generation, a group of fighters who rose before the 2nd generation but after the 1st generation.
[

Gun is half Japanese and half Korean according to PTJ himself.
Gun's father
is the Oyabun (Partriarch) of Yamazaki Clan, which makes him pure Japanese. Meaning Gun's mother is actually Korean.
Gun is not 20+ like many think. In
Episode 38
he is stated to be the same age as the seniors (who are 18-19), and one year has passed since then meaning he is now 19-20. He is more likely to be 19, however, Goo stated he would be unemployed when he turned 20,
[
12
]
so the same is likely for Gun.
It is revealed in the Shiro Oni arc (Gun's past arc) that he was actually born with Ultra Instinct
In chapter 501, Gun has been shown to have a hobby for carving wood at his residence, which is a Junkyard. The reason for this is unkown.
It has been confirmed by Charles Choi himself in the
Cheonliang
and Hunt for Gun arc, that
Gun's father
indeed was the Great Power the
Fist Gang
fought against, even admitting that the red paper holds the proof of his betrayal and his siding with the
Yamazaki Clan
.
According to Charles himself, Gun is a being which cannot be measured, even admitting that he is a genius and a son of a legend
(Gun's father
), his Genius as a training genius just goes on to show that he himself keeps growing as he trains people.
Gun is a regular smoker but till date hasn't done it in front of women or Goo (after he complained about the smoke in
Jake Kim arc
).

Ten Geniuses
Goo Kim
Like Gun, Goo Kim is another fighting legend. The two are rivals and best friends. Their attire often consists of opposing colors (Gun wears black/grey while Goo wears white/gold), and both dress very neatly. Gun was first sent to test Goo in a fight by the HNH chairman. It was implied that Goo gave Gun the nasty scar between his eyes (and possibly multiple others) during their fight and Gun caused Goo to need steel pins somewhere in his body. Later, Gun was hired by  Crystal's father as a bodyguard for Crystal. Because Gun left the debt collecting department, Goo now has to complete it all by himself.
Crystal Choi
Gun is Crystal's bodyguard and he often stays by her side to protect her. He is one of the few male characters who does not get smitten by Crystal's beautiful appearance (in her new body). Gun was hired by the HNH chairman to protect Crystal, and he is very protective of her.
Charles Choi
As one of the ten people raised by Charles, Gun deeply respects him and always follows his orders.
J High School
Daniel Park
Gun first met with Daniel when the latter tried to go after Crystal to thanked her. However, the meeting turns into a heated one because Daniel tried to touch Crystal. Gun was of course angry and tried to attack him. When Gun attacked him, he was quite impressed and called it that he had talent. When Gun meets Daniel again during the PTJ Entertainment case, he thinks that Daniel is reliable, showing that Gun recognizes his abilities. Later, when they meet again in the God Dog arc, Gun realizes that Daniel has the ability to imitate other people's movements, just like Yohan. Gun is of course happy and satisfied, because people who have such talent, apparently still exist. Gun meets Daniel again when he goes to James Lee's old school trying to find out more about James Lee. He asked to return the photo that Daniel took, but a fight broke out because Daniel did not want to give the photo. While fighting, they also argued about the Big Four Crews. However, Gun gets angrier and ends up trying to finish Daniel off for being stubborn.
However, Gun then sees Daniel enter in an "Ultra Instinct" state. Gun, when he saw Daniel who was in that state, at first did not think it was extraordinary but changed because Daniel showed many martial arts moves that he had never learned. Gun was certainly very happy and comforted because he met someone who was able to fight commensurate with him again. After the fight is over, Gun thanks Daniel and hands him the task of wiping out the Big Four Crews.
Vasco
Gun first meets Vasco when Gun fights with Daniel. Vasco who saw that of course was disturbed. As soon as Vasco starts to move, Gun immediately punches him in the face but is then surprised that Vasco is not so affected by his fist. Gun tries to fight back again because he finds it interesting, but is blocked by Crystal. During the Illegal Toto arc, he meets Vasco again when Vasco fights Jake. He misspelled Vasco's name with "Tabasco". When Vasco is overwhelmed against Jake, Gun appears and judges that Vasco's "hardware" is very good, but there is no "software" in him. After Gun fights with Jake, he admits that Vasco is a strong person because Gun said that "I won't remember weak people".
During the God Dog arc, Vasco meets Gun again and compares him with Johan, who has "sophisticated software" but "very ordinary hardware", as opposed to Vasco. Then, when Gun tries to attack Zack, Vasco protects him and then attacks Gun. Gun there realized that someone had installed "software" on him, where in the past he only had "hardware". Gun acknowledges Vasco even more because he has leadership and loyalty, just like Jake.

Background
Gun Park grew up in the family of the very famous and powerful leader of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
,
Shingen Yamazaki
, a legend comparable to
Gapryong Kim
in Japan, in the Yamazaki family of the Yakuza mafia organization. Gun Park was one of the four children conceived by Shingen Yamazaki, the current leader of the Yamazaki syndicate after the defeat of the
Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang
, with the goal of becoming Yamazaki's hope and taking their clan to the next level. Gun Park was originally born with reversible eyes (
Ultra Instinct
) from a
Somi Park
, woman and from the Hangure clan. From an early age, under the mentorship of
Shigeaki Kojima
and
Hiroaki Kojima
, Gun established himself as a genius who learns with great speed, and from an early age it became known that in a month he is able to master any martial art. However, for all his merits, he did not receive a name from his father, and he was also the leader of the clan. On the instructions of his mother, in order to earn a name from his father, Gun, as an elementary school student, he forcibly captured most gangs in Japan in one day. However, Gun had a cousin
Haruto Yamazaki
, the son of
Shintaro Yamazaki
, who treated him with love for his brother, and instructed him on a kind and honest path, without bloodshed, and most importantly advised him to live without relying on the expectations of others, and follow his own path. Gun Park told everything to Shintaro Yamazaki, the vice-head of the Yamazaki clan, and in order to follow all the rules of his clan, he forced Gun to kill his brother, and a little later he forced Haruto to commit Harakiri, which he did to please his father.
However, at the same time, the vassals of the Yamazaki syndicate intended to overthrow and kill Shingen and his son, Gun Park, and put his brother Shintaro Yamazaki in place of the head, acting not in the interests of the clan leader, but for the sake of the Yamazaki clan itself, but Shintaro flatly rejected this idea, saying that they had condemned themselves to death. After some time, the vassals nevertheless decided to attack Shingen himself, and the sons of the vassals attacked Gun Park, Shingen's son. However, the task turned out to be a failure on both sides, the vassals and their sons lost in an unequal battle with Shingen and Gun. After these events, Gun personally met his father and asked for his name, but Shingen did not even know about the existence of Gun all this time, showed his indifference, and then personally said that Gun was not his son, which hurt and hurt Gun very much.
Soon Gun Park arrived in Korea, in Seoul, and after a while he ended up in a juvenile colony for unknown reasons. In the juvenile colony, Gun Park came up with an individual training plan for himself to become stronger, the training consisted in the fact that all the prisoners of the prison fought against him alone. Soon after such training, Gun Park left a huge bloodstain on the wall of the Prison. Also at the time of his stay in prison, Gun Park met
Charles Choi
, who was working as a janitor at that time. And a year later, Charles Choi opened his own business and began to educate Gun Park as a Genius of Nurture, and also began to study with
Tom Lee
.
At some point in the past, after leaving the juvenile prison, the HNH chairman sent Gun to test
Goo Kim
's fighting ability in order to recruit him as Gun's partner. Both fighters were infamous for their prowess, and both individuals seemed to have heard of the other before their first encounter. Though it was not explicitly shown, it can be inferred that their first fight was intense and resulted in
Goo
giving Gun the scar between his eyes (and possibly more on his back and torso), while Gun caused
Goo
to need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments. The outcome, however, was unclear, as both fighters suffered heavy injuries. After the fight they joined forces and created the
4 crews
.
Gun was eventually assigned to bodyguard
Crystal Choi
, leaving
Goo Kim
to handle the business on his own much to his annoyance. They are seen meeting up together and talking about the crew heads or fighters throughout the series on different occasions.
Festival Arc
Gun easily subdues
Daniel Park
(Daniel Park) with a Brazilian kick after he tries to touch Crystal. When Vasco tries to intervene, Gun beats him as well with ease. Gun later tells Daniel that it has been ages since he has fought, but he sees great talent in Daniel as well as Vasco.
Lee Euntae Arc
Gun is seen meeting Goo for the first time, having been ordered to test Goo in a duel to determine Goo's fighting capabilities by the HNH chairman.
Illegal Gambling Arc
Gun goes to see
Jake Kim
, the top candidate for Gun's successor. When Jake Kim knocks out Vasco without much effort, Gun intervenes, stating that because Kim provided illegal gambling, Jake disqualified himself for the position. Angered, Jake Kim expresses his distaste for Gun's shady debt collecting operation with Joon Goo. He attempts to fight Gun and take his position by force but is brutally beaten and had several of his teeth pulled out by Gun
PTJ Entertainment Arc
During the Aru nude-shoot scandal, Gun and Goo are sent by the chairman to fight the PTJ CEO's gang of men. The deadly duo effortlessly dispatches their opponents. When Goo mockingly brings up Gun's successor, Gun replies with a mocking comment on Goo's hard debt collecting job. Goo, angered, initiates a fight with Gun because Gun left him alone to complete the job. The two chaotically clash until the HNH Chairman arrives.
God Dog Arc
After tensions rise between the God Dog crew and Vasco's Burn Knuckles, Johan was revealed to have been betrayed by his own crew members. When Johan prepares to fight Daniel Park, Vasco, Vin Jin, and Logan Lee simultaneously, Gun intervenes, stating that Johan had disqualified himself for his position by failing to integrate his own crew, let alone the four crews that Johan was supposed to unite. Outraged at his own failure, Johan attempts to fight and defeat Gun for the position. However, Gun beats Johan with relative ease. Eventually, Zack Lee steps in to defend Johan, as well as Daniel Park and Vasco. Surprised and pleased by the strong bonds of friendship within Daniel Park's group, Gun takes his leave.
Runaway Fam Arc
Gun Park is relaxing in the sauna with
DG
, and after a while
Goo Kim
comes in, discussing the
Hostel
Gun Park explains why the Hostel A will never be caught. In addition, Gun Park and Goo Kim competed to see who would stay in the bath longer, but when James left, Goo Kim explained why he came to the bath. In order to tell Gun Park that he came to meet his new secret friend.
Eli Jang (Arc)
After the defeat of
Darius Hong
, Gun Park found out about it and was very surprised, in turn,
Johan Seong
offered to defeat
Eli Jang
, in exchange for the fact that Gun Park would give him Kandong, Gun Park in turn agreed to look at the abilities of the hostel, and if Johan overcomes Eli Jang, then the
God Dog
will rule Kandong. A couple of days later, Johan, Gun Park, and
Jerry Kwon
met with
Warren Chae
, whom he accepted as members of
Backdoor
, Warren offers to fight with Jerry, whom he mistook for the boss. Watching Warren and Jerry fight, Gun Park notices that if Jerry hadn't been so stubborn and was able to block attacks, he would have become much stronger. Watching Eli Jang and Yohan fight, Gun Park notices the fact that Yohan is incredibly talented, but he is very naive and easy to betray, so Gun Park notices that this is the only trait that spoils his leadership qualities. Asking Eli Jang what makes him so desperate that he uses weapons in battle, to which he replied father will always protect his family, while pissing off Gun Park. Gun Park, having decided for himself that a
Big Deal
and a
God Dog
will share the kandonga, asked Jerry to pass it on to
Jake Kim
, in turn, Gun Park will destroy the hostel alone. During the battle against the Hostel, he was surprised by their teamwork, and soon he was very amazed by the fact that someone was able to mess with his hairstyle. After defeating the Hostel, Gun Park admitted that Eli Jang is the strongest among all four gangs, but acknowledged the fact that the hostel as a gang does not stand out among the four gangs. At the moment when Gun Park wanted to make Eli Jang regret that he had defeated the Backdoor leader,
Olly Wang
interrupted him, saying that they know how to make money by a cellular organization, saying that Eli Jang had invented this system, surprising Gun Park, and then calling Eli Jang the best candidate for a successor, and then left his phone number to contact him.
Hostel (Arc)
While cooking soup, we were talking about
Logan Lee
and his strength, Gun Park says that he wanted to give him an entire district for his strength, although according to Goo Kim, he does not like him.
Goo Kim
says that he is juicy on the outside and crispy on the inside, explaining that his muscles are protected by a layer of fat that absorbs all the force of the blow, saying that such a body is ideal for fights. During the training of the Gun Park, Goo Kim touched on the topic of  Eli Jang and his search, after Goo  Kim asks what Eli Jang hooked him with, Gun Park replied that his wildness could overcome him, describing Eli Jang as a wild beast. After Olly Wang's death, Gun Park flew to Japan to express condolences on the death of
Olly Wang
. After it's over, Gun Park meets
Eli Jang
outside the Hostel building with a
Yenna
in his hands, saying that he has changed a lot. After Eli Chan's words that the Hostel is no longer a gang, after Gan Park left, saying that the big Four only poisoned the life of this man.
Daniel Park VS Gun
Daniel Park
goes back to the abandoned school, where he is met by Gun Park. Gun Park asks to return the photo to him, to which Daniel Park refuses, after which Gun Park starts a fight, trying to take the photo by force. During the fight, Gun Park offers Daniel to become his successor and create his own gang and join the ranks of the
Four Major Crews
. To which Daniel refuses. During the battle, Gun Park knocked Daniel out, but after that Daniel entered the Ultra Instinct, starting to fight with Gun Park on equal terms all night, but soon Daniel returned to consciousness where Gun Park thanked him for a decent fight and then provided a ONE MCN business card along with a black VVIP badge, soon Gun Park wished good luck in the overthrow of the Four Major Crews.
Workers (4th Affiliate)
Alexander Hwang
had a phone conversation with Gun Park and
Goo Kim
about the ONE MCN business card, testing his theory about who could have given
Daniel Park
's original body the ONE MCN business card. Some time later, Goo Kim meets with Gun Park at a bowling alley, where Goo Kim told that he met
Tom Lee
. Goo Kim asks who would have won in a 1 on 1 fight
Samuel Seo
or Daniel Park, Gun Park replies that Daniel Park would have won, justifying this by saying that Samuel Seo is very cruel and not suitable for the role of successor.
Jake Kim (Arc)
Gun Park and Goo Kim came to the territory of a
Big Deal
to recruit a gang into the
Four Major Crews
, while
Sinu Han
recognized Goo Kim, they started a fight Gun Park watched this fight, analyzing Sinu Han's body and fighting skills Gun Park came to the conclusion that Sinu Han is strong, but not capable of being part of a big fours because of his age. During the battle, Goo Kim and Sinu Han were stopped by
Jake Kim
and
Samuel Seo
, Gun Park at the same time decided that the Big Deal would be part of the Four Major Crews, passing the news to
DG
. Before leaving, Gun Park said that they had only passed the initial assessment, and gave them the task to earn 100 million won in 1 month, and if they did not do it, they would destroy a Big deal. A month later, Gun Park and Goo Kim visit the Big Deal again, deciding that the gang could not earn the amount they named, they decided to disband and destroy the Big Deal, but Goo Kim, noticing 100 million won, changes his mind, however, Samuel, bringing the Black Bear gang, claims that the Big Deal wants to test their abilities by setting conditions if they pass The Big Deal test will become part of the Four Major Crews and give 100 million won, but if they fail the test, they will die. After passing the test, completely destroying the Black Bear gang, Gun Park was surprised by Samuel Seo's intellectual abilities, offering him to become the leader of a Big Deal, but soon Samuel handed over this position to the
Old Face
. After some time, Gun Park, sitting on a bench, analyzes Samuel Seo's abilities, coming to the conclusion that starting from his business sense and ending with his fighting abilities, he is perfect in everything, making an analogy with Jake Kim and Samuel Seo, he does not understand why Samuel thinks that he is inferior to Jake Kim, coming to the conclusion that Samuel may be an illegitimate child, Gun Park decided that Samuel Seo wanted to kill Jake Kim. After some more time, during the meeting of the Gangseo's girls' strike against Samuel and the meeting of Jake Kim and Samuel, seo Gun Park finally realized that Jake Kim is the son of
Gapryong Kim
. After the fight between Jake and Samuel, Sinu Han returned, who aimed at fighting Gun Park, but in fact Sinu Han was not going to fight Gun Park, but simply wanted to get rid of Samuel. After a while, sitting on the bench, Gun Park came to the decision to create a gang in Gangbuk, simultaneously giving the business card of the gang of
Workers
to Sinu Han, for which he needed to call, and sell himself to the Workers as a high-class fighter so that the earnings of a Big Deal would be much more rapid. After a while, Jake Kim began to steadily pay 100 million won to Gun Park. However, Jake Kim promised to buy Sinu Han for 5 billion won from the Workers. At the same time, Samuel Seo asked for another chance to become the successor of Gun Park, soon he gave him a second chance and also gave him the task to become a respected person with his gang Ganseo Union in Gannam, Samuel was the first person to whom Gun Park gave a second chance. While destroying other Korean gang, Gun Park along with Goo Kim, Gun Park decided to visit Samuel, but was extremely disappointed that he was beating up his own subordinates, he realized that Samuel would never become an ideal leader, so Gun Park decided to drop Samuel. After a while, Gun Park and Goo Kim pitted all 4 leaders of the
Four Major Crews
to identify the strongest leader, simultaneously betting on their favorite, Gun Park and Goo Kim bet 5 billion won each and the winner will win 10 billion won. Gun Park's favorite was Jake Kim, and Goo Kim's favorite was

We'll bring out your hidden beauty.
”
— Gyeol Baek,
Ep. 441
Gyeol Baek (백결)
is the president of the
Workers'
first affiliate and a minor antagonist in Lookism.
Appearance
Gyeoul has a tall, muscular physique. He has black hair in a two-block style and wears silver glasses. He is usually seen wearing black pants, a white dress shirt, a black tie, and his doctor's coat. He also wears a ring with the Workers' logo on his right middle finger.
Personality
His morals appear to be questionable since he conducts an unethical business by intentionally ruining clients' faces through surgery. Outside of this, he appears calm and amicable and even laughs at jokes.
Gyeoul's vision of true beauty is incredibly twisted, preferring how a man appeared after a car accident rather than his face after his brother fixed him. He is pointed out as being a hypocrite by Goo since he didn't even touch his own face.
After his brother's accident, he assumed his identity, had his father unjustly imprisoned using Korea's mental health legislature, murdered his mother after taking over her drug administration, and had
Jinyoung Park
force his brother back to life through human experimentation, whereupon Gyeoul would describe his brother's appearance as being beautiful, even surprising Jinyoung.
Goo Kim
, who knows the truth of what Gyeoul did, outright calls him a psychopath.
Relationships
Goo Kim
Goo and Gyeoul are somewhat familiar with each other, as Goo would have Gyeoul handle his shots when he went to the hospital, with Gyeoul believing he had come to help him on the side of the workers when he infiltrated the Grimm Plastic Surgery Clinic.
Eugene
He works with Eugene by way of the Workers' First Affiliate. They met while attending middle school together and Eugene offered to work with him. In the present day, they still seem to be close and occasionally meet up. He seems to be in the same high school as Eugene.
Synopsis
Gyeoul runs a business that used to be his father's plastic surgery office where he now works as the lead doctor. In reality, he takes clients with sponsored contracts that allow him to hire inexperienced surgeons who ruin the clients' faces while the office takes the money. According to him and Eugene, this illegal business is virtually undetectable.
Trivia
Hangyeoul knows several languages: which include Japanese, English, and Chinese.

episode 520
Haruto Yamazaki
was the son of the Yamazaki Clan's Vice-President,
Shintaro Yamazaki
, and the cousin of
Gun Park
.
Appearance
TBA
Personality
Unlike his father and most of the Yamazaki Clan members, Haruto didn't believe in bullying the weak, because he thought it was akin to hurting oneself.  As shown during Gun's flashback, Haruto was perhaps the only positive influence in his childhood, and unlike his father and Gun’s mother, encouraged him to have his own thoughts and make his own choices instead of just following their expectations for him. Gun acknowledged that the time he spent with Haruto was the only enjoyable part of his childhood.
Haruto was highly intelligent and administrative-savvy, so much so that his father and subordinates acknowledged that Haruto was more capable of becoming the next Yamazaki Clan leader, despite being a staunch believer in the clan’s traditions; therefore he deemed it as improper for Haruto to be the next head.
Relationships
Gun Park
Haruto's younger cousin, he dissuaded Gun from bullying the weak, his desire to have the heir not hurt anyone dissuading Gun from becoming the Yamazaki Clan Leader.

“
“It happens occasionally. When your body becomes hot in the middle of a fight. To be brief, it's self-hatred. You can't stand feeling disgusted with yourself. Why is this all I can do... Why can't I do more when I tried so hard... It's from your deep inside, what comes up becomes... The "self-hatred", "Sense of Inferiority", "Self-reproach". These sense of inferior emotions... are turned into hysteria.

“
Girls.. they must all love me!
”
Kim Heemin
is a camp instructor who appears in the Autumn Boot Camp Arc. His other alias is Zeus. Due to his handsome appearance, he is first well-liked by the students. However, he was revealed to be a pervert who was obsessed with
Mira Kim
, which resulted in his attempt to try and rape her.
Appearance
Heemin is a tall, young man who is thought to be very handsome by many people. He has pale skin and short black hair and his hair has always been like this ever since he was very young. Heemin has a slim body figure. He has dark coloured eyes and his eyelashes are sometimes visible.
Personality
When he first appears, he seems to be a mature camp introductory who is popular with the students. He is sometimes strict, checking bags for alcohol, cigarettes and cellphones, which aren't allowed on site. He is also reasonable, telling students that he hopes they don't hold a grudge against him for taking away prohibited items as it is a camp rule. However, this turns out to be only an act as he is actually a repeated sexual offender and that he is using a part-time job as a camp counselor so he could post pictures of female students online.
Relationships
Heemin is well liked and recieved by most people, due to his good looks. Many girls and women are attracted to him, and he abuses that trust.
Synopsis
History
When Heemin was young, he realized that looks can help him get away with bad behaviour when he stole the snacks of another child, Seungpyo, and hit him. Instead of punishing Heemin, the teacher tells Seungpyo to give Heemin the snacks because Seungpyo needed to lose weight.
Later, when he flips up the skirt of a girl as a junior school student, she doesn't get upset. As a senior in high school, a girl cheats on her boyfriend, Jaehan, with Heemin, telling him that she'll break up with Jaehan if Heemin would date her. Heemin comes to the conclusion that all girls must love him because of his attractive appearance.
In a later chapter, it is revealed he went to the same kindergarten or school with Daniel's stalker. Her first memory was Heemin telling her not to talk to him after making a ribbon ring for him.
Autumn Boot Camp Arc
Zeus appears as a camp instructor. He checked bags for alcohol and cigarettes and told students to hand in cell phones.
Daniel, in his original body, realizes that Zeus is actually a rapist and repeated sexual offender when he puts up a wanted poster in the convenience store where he works. In fact, Zeus had taken pictures of Mijin and other female students and had uploaded them online.
Zeus asks Mijin to help him put boxes into storage, when Won Bin, the other camp instructor, tackles him to the ground. Won Bin had realized something was going on when he repeatedly saw Zeus hanging around Mijin. Won Bin stole Zeus's cellphone and found out that he was taking photos of students and posting them online. Mijin, confused as to what was going on, believes Won Bin to be the pervert instead as he was holding Zeus's cellphone.
Zeus turns the tables on Won Bin, kicking him repeatedly. He then reveals the fact that he had taken the photos to Mijin. Mijin, scared, screams for help, but Zeus punches her, telling her not to play hard to get as she had allegedly flirted with him earlier. When she pleads with him to let her go, telling him that she wouldn't report him. He gets mad at her for saying so because he doesn't think he is doing anything wrong. Punching her, he tells Mijin that it was her fault for wearing revealing clothing and seducing him first, and tells her that it isn't rape.
Jin Sung
walks to see a crying and bleeding Mijin trying to hold Zeus off while he unbuckles her pants. Enraged, Jin Sung attacks him, only for Zeus to grab him. Jin Sung belatedly realizes that Zeus knows Muay Thai, and Zeus is able to break his ribs and both his arms. Zeus thinks he has won, but Won Bin suddenly graps Zeus's leg. Won Bin, unable to stand up, had crawled over to stop Zeus. Jin Sung punches Zeus in the face despite his broken arms. When Daniel finds Jin Sung and Mijin, they find Jin Sung out of his mind, repeatedly punching Zeus in the face.
As Zeus is being led away by the cops, bystanders comment that he looks too handsome to be a sexual offender and speculates about it being a false charge. Meanwhile, they laugh at the fact that Won Bin looks more like the perpetrator than the hero.
In prison, Zeus realizes that the leader of the prisoners is Gangnam Landlord from the Paprika TV Arc, or the stalker who assaulted Ha Neul.
Fighting Prowess
Zeus is a sadistic fighter who has little mercy for his enemies. He was able to break Zack's arms during their fight, though he could not defeat him in the end. His fighting style is Muay Thai.
Quotes

Fighting Prowess
The King of Pyeongtaek trained his fists, this can be seen by looking at the scars he had on his fist, and his strongest attack is his punch that comes from below. As for his level, he would scale slightly weaker than the King of Suwon, since defeating Seokdu, required the combined effort by the trio of Eli, Samuel, and Warren, while the King of Pyeongtaek was defeated by the duo of Eli and Warren.

HNH Company (HNH그룹)
is a conglomerate company that owns smaller businesses, with its CEO being Charles Choi, who founded the company in just over 4 years, during the
1st Generation
.
Organization
As a company, HNH owns a number of diverse companies and organizations, such as PTJ Entertainment, as well as having the media on its side.
HNH only became what it is today thanks to the efforts of a group of 10 especially skilled individuals called the "
Ten Geniuses
", it was thanks to these efforts that
Charles Choi
and the HNH Company managed to reach the top in just about 4 years.
Furthermore, at the beginning of the company, Charles already had a short-term partnership with the
Cheonliang's shaman
, which ended after his death, as
his son
did not maintain the partnership. Therefore, the biggest way for the HNH Company to make money at the beginning was certainly through the creation of the
Four Major Crews
, these being four gangs from a specific region of Seoul, who were forced by
Gun Park
and
Goo Kim
to pay 100 million Won every month, to generate funds for the Company, currently, this scheme is no longer in operation.

Synopsis
Episode 191
Daniel
is overwhelmed by his problems and decides to run away. He returns home to
his mother
and discovers she is dating someone. Feeling like a burden he decides to live on the streets. Daniel realizes how difficult it is to be homeless.
While living on the streets, Daniel hears about a famous thief called 'the Mole' who steals people's things. In the subway he falls asleep and gets his money stolen. Daniel witnesses some homeless fighting over his wallet.
Episode 192
The homeless tell Daniel that they thought someone abandoned the bag, which is now devoid of money and his phone. A homeless man takes Daniel in and feeds him soup and gives him a place to stay for the night.
When Daniel wakes up, the homeless man is gone. He is found by
Moley
and his friends, a bunch of homeless kids who take him in. They show him how to shower and where to eat food. In a line he spots a man faking a disability and is disgusted. Moley is quick to tell him that there is no fairness on the streets. He decides to show Daniel another way to make money.
Moley tells him there is a homeless man who embezzled money; if Daniel can grab the money and return it, the company will give him a reward. Daniel is caught by the man, who is the homeless man from earlier.
Episode 193
Moley hits the homeless man and tells Daniel to run. The homeless man chases them and Daniel gets second thoughts. He stops and refuses to follow Moley. They fight for the bag and it rips, scattering the man's money. Moley tells Daniel he will get revenge and disappears. The other homeless gather the money and return it to the man, and he is brought to tears.
The man explains he was saving the money to buy an outfit for his daughter's wedding. He abandoned his family to avoid harassment from loan sharks. He collected money from church alms to get the amount. At the homeless man's hideout he gives Daniel some advice and tells him to return home.
Daniel is sitting near a sewer contemplating when he is attacked by Moley, who came back for revenge. They try to steal the man's money and begin beating him. Daniel begins hallucinating and decides to run away, but is conflicted about the man. He is reminded of Duke and decides to fight Moley.
Episode 194
Daniel removes his victim mentality and begins fighting Moley. He is hit with the baseball bat but knocks out his attacker and Moley. He discovers Moley is the famous thief who stole his wallet. Daniel goes with the homeless man to his daughter's wedding and they are reunited.
Daniel returns home and looks at his friends' social media to see how they are doing. He is surprised to see that
Logan
is dating
Zoe
.
Notes
The man faking his disability is the same pastor from the
Cult arc
The quote Moley told Daniel about the world being unfair in Episode 192 is the exact same one
Jiho
told himself in the
juvie arc

Synopsis
Backstory
As a baby, he and his brother have been weighed a lot more for their age. His brother, Ivan, when he was a baby, weighed 51 kg, while Hope himself, weighed a lot more, at 92 kg. As of Chapter 203, there is not much about him other than the fact he fought Logan.
Fighting Prowess
Hope Park is arguably one of the strongest characters in the series. He never worked out or picked up a martial art due to his innate strength. He was capable of driving
Logan Lee
into a corner and even pick him up. However, this proved to be his downfall as he lacked the skill necessary to beat Logan Lee in a contest of fighting skill. In chapter 252 he was able to learn wrestling from his brother and become more skilled. In the end, he still suffered a loss again against
Eli Jang
.

--- FILE: Hostel.txt ---
Hostel
was a member of the
Four Major Crews
. It is centered in Gangdong, east of the Han river. Their leader is
Eli Jang
.
History
Hostel was founded by Eli Jang as a nickname for the family he created out of his orphaned friends.
[
1
]
The name is in English and each letter represents the Korean name of his friends:
H for Hyun (Eli)
O for Onseok (Warren)
S for Serim (Sally)
T for Taenggu (Max)
E for Eunggoo (Derrick)
L for Lyon (Ryan the cat)
He gave each of the members of Hostel a role in the family: Eli was the father, Sally was the mother, Warren/Max/Derrick were uncles.
Heather
and
Olly
were friends of Sally, but they were not given letters because they were not orphans.
The original purpose of Hostel was to give a home to kids without one. However, when Eli defeated the leader of
Backdoor
he created a power vacuum in the region.
Jerry Kwon
of Big Deal and
Johan Seong
of God Dog quarreled over the rights to the region, but
Gun
rejected both of their cases and made Hostel into one of the 4 big crews.
[
2
]
Eli Jang established the runaway family to collect money for Gun to maintain their position, but quit his job when he realized he had neglected to care for his girlfriend
Heather
. He then disappeared with his child and left Hostel void of leadership.
Organization
Hostel A follows a point organization where higher members contact lower members of the gang and not vice versa.
[
3
]
At the bottom of the hierarchy are the runaway fams, groups of homeless children who earn money for Hostel. They usually earn it through illegal means like prostitution scams or petty theft. The use of children and teenagers to pay for Hostel's dues is why other gangs call Hostel the "worst criminal organization."
Leaders of runaway fams are called "Dads" or "Moms". They have a tattoo of a lowercase 'h' to signify their status in Hostel, and they report to executives to pay their membership fees. Leaders cannot contact their higher ups easily, so it is easy for executives to cut them off.
The main branch of Hostel is centered in Seoul, and has the same structure as the original Hostel. The Cheongliang branch joined Hostel A later on to earn money.
[
4
]
The Cheongliang fam also joined Hostel A as mercenaries to get revenge on Vin Jin.
[
5
]
Hostel B consists of the remaining members of the original Hostel. Max and Derrick left to earn money for a time period
[
6
]
and
Ryan
was adopted by Jerry Kwon.
[
7
]
Warren chose to stay to keep his promise to protect Sally and keep her company. Their motto is to give a home to the lost children of the Gangdong region and fulfill Eli Jang's original goal. There is no sophisticated organization. Instead, they refer to themselves as family members: Eli is the father (Big Daddy), Warren, Max and Derrick are uncles, Sally is the mother (Big Mama). Following the Runaway Fam Arc, Amy Lee and Natalie Cho were taken in by Hostel B, where they have jobs at a local food truck.
[
8
]
They are treated like the children of Hostel B.

Synopsis
After his departure Hostel split into two different parties: Hostel A run by Olly Wang and Hostel B run by Sally Park. Hostel A continues to earn money for the 4 big crews using the runaway fams, while Hostel B continued its original goal of taking care of abandoned kids in Gangdong.
The Cheongliang Branch of Hostel was added to Hostel A later on. It was initially established by Seth Lee as an attempt to expand
Hostel A's
reach in Seoul and earn money for his brothers. Prior to that, they were members of the now defunct
K-House
gang. They had two main operations at the time: a tea house which employed girls, and a gambling house that was rigged. They originally employed Jin Jang's girlfriend to begin prostitution scams in Cheongliang. However, their efforts were thwarted by
Jace Park
and
Johan Seong
in their attempts to rescue the girl, who was also Jace's crush. They were since sent by
Olly Wang
to fight the J High kids who were on their way to Gangdong.
When Sally and Warren informed Eli about Olly Wang's abuse of children, he rejoined Hostel B as their leader to take down Olly Wang.
[
9
]
Hostel B accompanied J High during the battle at Gangdong, and declared war against Hostel A. Hostel A's leader ended up committing suicide during his fight with Eli Jang. Afterwards Hostel A disbanded, and their members went their separate ways. Hostel B is the only remaining faction using their original name, and maintaining their original goal.
Trivia
The O in Hostel is a misspelling of Warren's original name, "Wonseok"
Naming the leaders 'Dad' in the runaway fam is reflective of Olly's desire to be like Eli Jang, the original Dad of Hostel. He also gave himself a similar tattoo despite never being in the original Hostel
Gun and Goo have a point system for the four crews similar to Hostel's
Some of members of Big Deal deemed that Hostel's members are fighters who use a dirty method, the polar opposite of Big Deal's tradition which favors fair and square fights.
Warren got an acknowledgement from Jerry that the former will fit well in Big Deal.
Gun has ranked Hostel B as the best of the best.

Synopsis
Episode 266
This arc starts off with Eli Jang, a kid sold in an illegal adoption operation. His seller employs him in various scams to get money from the illegal adoption. Eli lives with his seller, a man he calls "Mr. Carpenter". He teaches him how to live on the streets and makes him behave violently towards strangers. This man is actually
Olly Wang
, who wants to create another version of Eli Jang, his old friend he is obsessed with. What little Eli wants the most is a family, so he obeys Olly's every command.
When Eli goes to rob a store he is stopped by
Eli Jang
from J high school. Little Eli snaps at Eli, and he is shocked to see the kid behaving just like he did when he was younger.
Episode 267
Eli brings his daughter
Yenna
to meet
Sally
and Warren. Sally tells Eli about Olly creating Hostel A and begs him to come back to Hostel. He refuses, because he has a daughter.
Jin Jang
prepares for his second stage of the plan, which involves
Jasmine
.
At school, Jasmine's father comes in and pleads for the kids to help find his daughter, saying someone told him they could help.
Jay
,
Daniel
and
Vasco
decide to go to Gangdong to search for Hostel, where Jasmine ran off to.
Zack
goes on his own and
Vin
and
Logan
go to destroy the pictures of
Mary
and
Zoe
. Eli shows up later with Warren after discovering Olly is turning little Eli into a criminal.
Jin believes Eli won't show up because he has a baby to take care of. He also doesn't think
Johan
will come, although
Jerry Kwon
worries about that. Hostel A send all their men to Gangdong to confront the J High kids, who plan to destroy
Hostel
.
Episode 268
All of the J High kids split in different directions. Vasco approaches Vin, who is torturing a kid for information. He tells him to stop being a bully and Vin gets angry and decides to fight Vasco. Logan spots Jay's motorbike and decides to steal it. He spots Logan and wants his motorbike back, so the two fight.
Zack is the first to find Jasmine, and he tells her to get ready. She tells him that she can't return home because her father sexually abuses her. Daniel interrupts them to tell Jasmine to come with him, but Zack refuses to allow him, and refuses to tell him her secret.
Jin Jang
explains that he spent time analyzing the J High kids. Together they are powerful enough to destroy Hostel, but their weakness is that they hate each other. He studied their pet peeves; Vasco hates bullies (Vin), Logan hates Daniel while Jay likes him, and Zack and Daniel are both very stubborn. Since they cannot agree on anything, they will end up destroying themselves.
Episode 269
Daniel realizes that Zack will not decide to let him through. He decides Zack is being unreasonable and tries to sucker punch him like before, but Zack stays in place.
Vin asks Vasco if he resents him for bullying Duke. He tells Vasco that Duke deserved to be bullied because he is poor, fat and ugly, and Vasco lunges at him. He throws Vasco onto the ground and traps him in an armbar. Vin reveals to Vasco that the reason he quit wrestling is because he was a sadistic kid who liked breaking people's bones.
Vasco overpowers Vin and sends him flying with one punch. He has learned how to fight from his time in the bear family, and has taken the mother bear to be his second master.
Episode 270
Vasco tells Vin to apologize and he will stop, but Vin refuses. Vasco brings out the red mongkol and the two begin fighting to the death.
Ivan Park
is watching in horror and notifies Jin Jang, who sets out to leave with Olly Wang.
Logan decides to run over Jay, but he kicks him off the bike. It swerves and explodes, causing Logan to get pissed off. Elsewhere,
Goo Kim
and
Gun
discuss Logan Lee, and Goo remarks that Logan's muscular build is the reason he wants him as a successor.
Jay is at a disadvantage but he does his best using Systema, a fighting technique he learned from his teacher as a child. He manages to hurt Logan enough to force him into choking Jay. Jay is about to tap out when Logan remarks he will hurt Daniel the same way. He feints like he is knocked out and grabs a red-hot exhaust pipe from his broken bike and holds it to Logan's back.
Logan releases Jay out of the pain. He is shocked to see Jay's hands are bleeding from the heat of his weapons. Elsewhere, Warren is in shock at how good Eli's fighting skills have become under Gun's training.
Episode 271
Logan is having a hard time fighting Jay due to his long range pipe attacks. He grabs his own pipe and heats it, and uses it to choke Jay. Jay retaliates and the two begin choking each other.
Hope Park
watches and relays this to Jin Jang, while Gun and Goo continue to talk about Logan.
Daniel is having a tough time fighting Zack. Zack reveals the reason he returned to fighting is because he couldn't beat Logan, but he is more intimidated by Daniel. After faking out Daniel with a punch, Zack decides to let him go. Daniel calls him back to fight and he copies his exact moves, using even stronger punches like Gun's. He decides to let go of Zack the same way he let go of him, and Zack gets angry. He leaps at Daniel, who is slow to block his moves. Zack gets encouraged and says he knows what Daniel's weakness is.
Elsewhere, Jin Jang comments that nobody is there to stop him. As he says this, Johan Seong arrives in Gangdong with
Eden
and
Miro
.
Episode 272
Olly and the Hostel A uncles have sent someone to deal with Eli and Warren when they arrive in Gangdong. Meanwhile, Daniel and Zack continue to fight. Zack feels overwhelmed by Daniel and wonders if he is a genius, because he isn't a natural fighter like Daniel and Johan. Daniel's weakness is that he doesn't have the willpower of a fighter, and that keeps Zack fighting as long as he can.
In jail,
Jake Kim
wonders how Jin Jang will fare against J High. He sent Jerry Kwon to deal with Zack and Daniel if Jin Jang needs assistance.
Episode 273
Vin and Vasco are approached by
James Gong
and MC Pesticides, who came to fight Vin. However the two of them ignore him, so he decides to fight both of them. Logan and Jay are also fighting when they are interrupted by
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
, who want to fight them when they are weak. Logan makes a deal with Jay and then knocks him out, deciding to fight them alone.
Daniel and Zack continue to fight, and they are evenly matched. When Daniel jumps at Zack he gets hit by both Zack and Jerry Kwon, who tried to ambush him. Zack and Jerry are surprised to see Daniel stand up while unconscious, and his eyes are black like Gun's.
Episode 274
Zack realizes they are in a trap and tries to take Daniel home, but he knocks him out the way. Daniel begins fighting Jerry. Jerry made a promise to himself the day Jake was disqualified that he would never lose another battle, but he loses easily to Daniel. When Daniel recovers from unconsciousness, Jerry decides to fight them with boxing.
Eli and Warren come across some Hostel members who have been stealing like Olly used to. Eli feels bad about it, and Warren tries to comfort him when Darius approaches them (he was released from prison before Jiho or Jake). He attacks Eli, who defeats him easily with aikido, before being stabbed by little Eli, who Olly sent to fight him.
Episode 275
Daniel and Zack lose to Jerry Kwon, who drags them to Hostel's headquarters, where everyone else is. Jin Jang explains that he set them up to be in Gangdong so he could humiliate them. The boys quickly recover and start fighting Hostel together.
Vasco expects Jace to come but he instead sends Johan to watch over the situation. The runaway kids are surprised to see Warren and Eli appear with capital H tattoos. When Eli appears, everyone falls silent and he asks to see Olly Wang.
Episode 276
Eli Jang has a flashback to when he stopped the kid from stabbing him. A few members of Hostel recognize Eli as the original head of Hostel. Warren and Jerry begin fighting until he is called back by Jin Jang, who wants to propose something to Warren, but Warren beats him for killing his vibe.
The other J High kids continue fighting but they are brutally exhausted. Olly knocks out Vasco and Jay and calls out Eli Jang, who is shocked to see Olly is happy to see him.
Episode 277
Warren Chae reveals the reason he was put in an orphanage was because his father killed his mother. He fights Olly and is surprised to see Olly does not feel pain from his attacks. Eli interferes and decides to beat Olly but is stopped by his legion of homeless kids, who he orders to attack Eli. Justin and Chuck attack Daniel and Jay, and Johan decides to enter the arena.
Episode 278
The Burn Knuckles arrive at the scene to support the J High kids, but they are all beaten by Justin and Chuck. Then two men come pushing a food truck towards the battle, and reveal themselves to be Max and Derrick. Johan left the fight once he learned they were on their way, and they quickly defeat the uncles of Hostel A.
Episode 279
Vin Jin beats MC Pesticides and leaves the battle, revealing his fighting style to be Kudo. Hostel B is surrounded by Olly's gang of children, but they are beaten by Logan Lee and they all scatter.
Olly beats both Max and Derrick, and reveals that he cannot feel pain. He then goes to fight Eli Jang, but he gets run over by James Gong's bus.
Episode 280
Jin Jang has a flashback where he learns James plans to betray Olly because he is annoyed by him. Olly was aware of this betrayal by both of them, and asks Jin Jang to grant him one last favor: to see Eli Jang one last time.
Hostel girl then betrays Jace and reveals she is Jin Jang's girlfriend, wearing a wig. Jin Jang sent Jerry Kwon away so he wouldn't learn he is reviving his old crew called K House. Back at Sally's house, Eli confront Olly to fight him.
Episode 281
Warren blocks the runaway fam from entering the fight, so Eli and Olly can fight in peace. Olly remembers how caged he felt in his middle school years, and how much he respected Eli for his freedom. He is disappointed that Eli is not stronger than him, but Eli gets back up and shows Olly he is still as strong as him.
Episode 282
Eli and Olly continue their fight on the roof. Goo asks Gun in a different location why he favored Eli, and he mentions his reckless and wild behavior. As Olly and Eli are equally matched, Olly reflects on why he wanted to see Eli; because Eli is the first person who made him feel fear. Olly has had to pretend to feel emotions for most of his life do to his condition. But now he does not feel it, because Eli is stronger than him.
Warren, Max and Derrick and Sally appear and Olly beats them all except for Sally. He asks her why he is unable to feel anything, and tries to hit her but Warren protects her. Olly sees Heather in Sally and realizes that what he felt wasn't fear of Eli, but guilt for what he had done to Heather. He becomes overwhelmed with grief and jumps off the roof to kill himself.
Episode 283
The people who knew Olly mourn his death. Chuck and Justin scatter his ashes at a riverside and burn the money they earned from Hostel B. They ask the little Eli what he will do. He eats Olly's ashes and says he was meant to be alone since he is an Eli. Johan observes the small funeral and says he didn't plan on coming, but he happened to be wearing black.
Jasmine and James are on the run again, this time with the abandoned kids Olly was raising. Jasmine sews jackets for them and is happy to play the mother, but James  is annoyed since Olly is dead. He decides to play the father.
In Japan, Gun expressed his condolences to Olly. Big Deal wears black for his funeral, and Jake lights a cigar under an umbrella. Jin Jang meets with a Workers member in a bar, who congratulates him on destroying Hostel. He offers Jin Jang a bronze badge, and he bows.
Hostel B meet at Heather's grave to let her know that they sent Olly off. Sally asks where it all went wrong and starts crying. When they arrive at the hotel, Eli tells them that he'd like to live with them. Gun is disappointed to hear this. The kids turn to see that he is holding Yenna.
Episode 284
Eli tries fighting Gun but he is overpowered easily.
Gun
explains to
Eli
that
Olly Wang
has been paying for their protection for years. He has decided to stop demanding money from
Hostel
as a last favor for Olly, because he has
Big Deal
and
Workers
to rely on. Eli relays all of this information to the gang at J High and tells them they should be careful dealing with Gun, because he doesn't want there to be any more tragedies.
Zack
remembers this as he visits
Johan's mother
, and swears he will bring him back home.
Jasmine's
father also grieves Jasmine's loss, hugging her blanket in a strange manner.
Meanwhile
Daniel
mulls over the tragedy of Hostel. He decides to investigate the secret of
James Lee
, and returns to his school. He finds that the school doors and not locked, and the trophy room is empty. In a dark classroom, he finds James's locker with his picture inside it. He also finds Gun waiting for him.

Synopsis
Episode 255
The guys and girls are on the train to Cheongliang when the girls catch the eye of a small crew in Cheongliang, who are also a bunch of perverts. They want to approach the girls but cannot because they are sitting with
Daniel
and
Zack
. As they enjoy the ride Daniel realizes how much he missed not having to fight.
In another compartment
Jace
and
Vasco
are seated on the train, but in different compartments. They are on a mission to get information on Hostel's
branch operation in Cheongliang
. A girl comes to sit next to Jace and offers him candy. He tries to ignore her but he eventually falls for her.
The train perverts make their way over and begin harassing the gang, first by spilling Coca-Cola on Zack. He gets up to fight but is reprimanded by Daniel and decides not to. They are intimidated by Vasco, who tells them to fuck off. The perverts return to their leader Matt Kang and warn him of the gangster they just met (Vasco).
On a pit stop Vasco gets down to eat some sausage bars. He buys two for himself and Jace, but he took a lot of time and misses the train. Jace does not notice until his seatmate points it out. He tells Vasco to not to worry about the missed train, and that he will meet him at the destination they decided. Vasco yells at him to notice that the girl he is seated with has a tattoo of an 'h' on her wrist, and is therefore a member of Hostel.
Episode 256
Members of Hostel A muse about the girl with the 'h' tattoo.
Seth Lee
, the head of the Cheongliang branch has just been inducted into Hostel by beating Chuck Kwak. He asks if she is experienced and
Jasmine Huh
tells him that the girl will learn quickly because she is a runaway and desperate for a home. He wonders about the Cheongliang fam and is told that they will not interfere because they are just gangsters. They also tell him not to worry about
Burn Knuckles
, because there is no one smart enough to stop them.
Jace is talking to the girl with the tattoo and mentions that Hostel is in the region. He warns her to be careful, then tells her that she should keep the information secret, because no one knows it. A man in black is seated behind them and hears what they have said. It is revealed that the train perverts are headed to become a branch of Hostel in Cheongliang.
Since Vasco missed the train, the perverts decide to pursue the girls further. One of them smells
Joy's
hair, and in retaliation Zack decides to smell his hair. The man punches Zack and Daniel is concerned for him. He tells Daniel not to worry, that he won't fight because he doesn't want to ruin
Mira's
vacation. He makes Daniel promise to shave his hair if he fights. The perverts laugh and one of them hits Zack, but he takes it and decides to hold back.
Back on the train the boys see the girls being harassed by the gangsters. One of the perverts pours soda on Mira and uses it as an excuse to touch her thighs. Zack places his own thigh there and tells Daniel to get him a razor, as he intends to fight.
Episode 257
Zack is about to beat the perverts when their leader intervenes and apologizes for their behavior. They take their leave and one of the perverts begins talking inappropriately about Mira. He trips over the leg of the figure in black and demands an apology. Jace tells the gangster to not bother the guy and the pervert assumes he is stupid and leaves.
In the train bathroom the perverts gather to talk about a photograph. Zack decides to apologize from within the stall, and the perverts accept his apology. They show him an image of Mira they took secretly, and ask what he thinks of her. He begins to beat them.
Back at their seats the girls continue to be harassed by the perverts. The leader receives a photo of Mira from his associates and is called out by Joy for taking creepshots of girls (known in Korea as
molka
). Mira,
Zoe
and Daniel race to see what is going on, and Daniel demands to see the picture. As he is beating the perverts, Zack manages to knock over Daniel's suitcase, knocking out Little Daniel and releasing Big Daniel. The girls watch in shock as Daniel walks over to the leader and stands behind him menacingly.
Jace gets up to help stop the fight but he is stopped by the man in black. He tells the man not to worry because he can handle in a fight. The man tells him he is aware of this and reveals himself to be
Johan Seong
. Jace is startled and asks if he is trying to join Hostel. Johan turns the question on Jace and reveals that the tattoo on the girl's arm, exposing her as a member of
Hostel
.

“
I am the sun of Ansan. Your pride, your self-respect.. I can’t lose.
”
Hudson Ahn (안현성 Ahn Hyun-seong)
is the leader of
Ansan Public
, and the successor of
Taesoo Ma
. He's joined Allied for the goal of revenge against Eli Jang.
Appearance
Hudson has blond hair and sharp eyes. His clothes are school uniforms and he wears a red turtleneck underneath. His right hand is more bumpy than other characters; it is implied that the bones in his right hand have been replaced with steel. is quite attractive as Natalie called him cute. (she’s always the one to point out a good looking guy)
Personality
He has a cold but flexible personality. He respects his senior Ma Tae-soo very much and considers him an idol. he possesses stoic tendencies with his conviction.
Relationships
Ansan Public
Taesoo Ma
TaeSoo Ma seems to have a taecher-alumni relationship with the leader of the
Ansan Public
,
Hudson Ahn
. TaeSoo Ma had seem to be pestered by Hudson to teach him how to become as strong as him as Taesoo was considered the "King Of Ansan" when husdon was younger. Hudson seems to have met him around the age of 16, Hudson learned from TaeSoo as he uses his right arm as in fighting and only uses the left when needed. It seems TaeSoo left Ansan in Hudsons care and Husdon thinks very highly of his "Master" Taesoo Ma.
Fighting Prowess
Unlike other characters, he didn't learn martial arts in particular. But he's steadily building up his body and showing off his powerful strength, he hits a person with his left hand and shows the ridiculous power of the people behind him to fall down. His biggest feature is his extremely disciplined right hand. His right hand is so hard that it is often compared to steel. In his fight against
Eli Jang
the force of his right-hand punch was enough to break his ribcage and the second to stun him, if it weren't for Eli's great resistance and determination to withstand the first two punches and the fact that Hutson had his guard down, with his third punch he could have won the fight.
After redoing all his training from the beginning with
Taesoo Ma
, his right-handed punch became so strong that he can now break rocks and crush his opponents with a single blow, sinking them into the ground or walls with the impact leaving the mark of his fist.
Quotes
"I am the sun of Ansan. Your pride, your self-respect.. I can’t lose"

"It looks like you're about as strong as Daniel Park... but you've made a mistake. You lost the moment my fist struck you."

Synopsis
Episode 83
Jace
is working at a café where kids are gambling illegally. His colleague John asks Jace for some money to gamble and he refuses. John spots
Jiho
and
Duke
leaving the café and sees Jiho is wearing expensive clothes. He chases after Jiho and asks him for some money.
Duke complains to
Daniel
that Jiho is trying to gamble illegally, and John walks in. He thanks Jiho for lending him the cash and gives him some of his earnings. Jiho is amazed at what John earned and he asks Jiho if he would like to try the game, because he has inside information on how to win. Jiho begins gambling.
Episode 84
Jiho begins bragging about his luck at the gambling game. At the cafe, John asks if Jiho would like to meet his friend and introduces him to
Jake Kim
, who asks if Jiho would like to go out to eat. Jiho is drawn to Jake's kindness and Jace notices the men staring at Jiho's shoes. He tells Jake to take care of Jiho and the man glares at him, scaring Jace.
As Jiho is walking home he runs into some old bullies of his. He tells Jake and Jiho to stay back and starts talking to them, but they hit Jiho and insult him. Jake asks if these are Jiho's friends and then beats them, saying he is Jiho's best friend.
Episode 85
John tells Jiho he can no longer give him tips because he could get in trouble. Jiho decides to play anyway and begins losing money. He becomes addicted to gambling and loses all his money. To pay it back he begins stealing from his school tuition and Daniel's convenience store.
At a gym,
Crystal
is working out when she is approached by men.
Gun
scares them off and tells Crystal there is a guy he wants to take over when he graduates from his business (Jake). Jake, John and a loan shark are eating together and John reveals he earns commission money for every person he brings to the gambling site.
Jiho runs back to Jake and John and asks them to lend him more money because he lost it. The loan shark tells him to bring his father's ID and the deed to his house to authorize the loan.
Episode 86
Zoe
is annoyed that Daniel uses his own money to cover for Jiho stealing and he is worried about him. Jiho brings a homeless man to pretend to be his father and gets the loan. He blows all the money but earns it during an unexpected lucky guess.
Episode 87
Jiho notices the money has not been deposited to his account and grows nervous. He visits the gambling office and the people are gone. They removed Jiho from the list of players and kept his money, and they refuse to deposit what he won. Jiho asks Jace about John and Jace doesn't know where he is. Jace grows worried about Jiho and
Vasco
says he should help him because he is Daniel's friend.
Jiho goes to the loan shark office and tells him he will pay when he finds Jake. The man tells him finding Jake is not his responsibility and that Jiho had better pay or he will be in legal trouble. Jiho goes to wallow in a park and is kicked out by the homeless. He recognizes the homeless man and asks him for help, but gets robbed of his clothes and money.
Jiho returns to the store and apologizes to Daniel for stealing. Crystal tells Jiho she knows someone who can help him and calls
Kouji
.
Episode 88
Jake Kim is walking home when he runs into Vasco and Jace, who tell him to return Jiho's money. Jace recognizes Jake as the leader of
Big Deal
, one of the largest gangs in Seoul. Jake refuses to give the money back and Vasco prepares to fight him.
Kouji is disappointed in Jiho but decides to help him anyway. He asks Daniel to call three trusted friends and he brings Jay and Zack. Vasco cannot come because he is fighting Jake Kim. He loses miserably and Jace is stunned at the loss. As Jace prepares to fight Jake they are interrupted by a stranger.
Episode 89
The stranger who interrupted them is Gun, who came to tell Jake he is disqualified for illegal activity. Jake prepares to fight Gun and he threatens to rip out his teeth. Elsewhere, John and the loan shark notice Jiho entered his friends into the game and are happy to earn more money.
The students are disappointed to find themselves losing, but Kouji is not. He states the reason they entered as Jiho's friends was to gain entry to the system. He asks them to deposit money into their accounts and wait.
Episode 90
Kouji explains that losing the money was a necessary step to gain access to the system. He makes a bot who tells the gamblers that the system made a deposit into their accounts, and the accounts fill with money. Kouji takes all the money from the gambling account and gives Jiho his amount, telling him to live better.
Vasco and Jace are shocked to see Jake defeated by Gun. Vasco asks if he is weak and Gun responds that he doesn't remember the names of weak guys. He then proceeds to call him "Tabasco". Jiho goes back to school happy and cured of his addiction.

--- FILE: Innate_Strength.txt ---
Innate Strength
is a rare and inherited talent through the blood of children of Legends, allowing them to experience a newfound level of strength after Awakening it. This has only been seen in
Vin Jin
and
Jake Kim
so far. Their eyes will glow purple and their strength grows exponentially.
Explanation
Innate Strength is extremely rare, and those who possessed it were completely powerful, capable of overcoming any obstacle. As the name suggests, Innate Strength offers its user strength far beyond human capacity, surpassing even the power of someone who possesses
Strength Mastery
.
Furthermore, some of those who possess the Innate Strength have the natural ability to see the
Invisible Strike
.
[
1
]
Achieving Innate Strength
As Gapryong Kim once said
[
2
]
everyone is capable of having superhuman power, and that he was only strong because he had managed to find the way to this strength. Even so, it is not easy to achieve this strength, however, the children of those who possessed the Innate Strength seem to unconsciously have an easier time finding this path, such as Jake Kim and Vin Jin.
Users
Gapryong Kim's Lineage
Gapryong Kim
was the first character to be introduced with Innate Strength, he utilized it in a highly proficient manner, with his strength being described as rough but smooth.
[
3
]
His eldest son,
Kitae Kim
, uses this strength in an extremely unrefined way, without applying any technique, in addition Kitae uses this strength to supplement his lack of talent for the Copy Technique.
His second son,
Jake Kim
, has this still unawakened strength, using it from time to time, when faced with situations of extreme danger, the way he used his Innate Strength is similar to his father, and when he is able to use, he takes on a look very similar to Gapryong.
Mujin Jin's Lineage
Mujin Jin
has still been very little explored, but from what has been shown, he used his Innate Strength in his fighting style, to improve the strength of his grabs and throws.
His only son,
Vin Jin
, also has the Innate Strength, but it is still unawakened, as does Jake Kim. Vin uses this strength to mainly exponentially increase the strength of his grip.

--- FILE: Invisible_Attacks.txt ---
Invisble Attacks are a rare and unique fighting style that involves attacking the opponent's blindspots with extreme speed and accuracy. This technique is so fast and powerful that people who are not able to comprehend the speed of the attacks, consider them "invisible" to the eye.
The technique is so demanding of speed and accuracy that only 3 people in the History of Fists have been able to properly utilise it. Even Daniel Park was unable to copy this technique.
Charles Choi: Striking Attacks
Charles, the first user of Invisible Attacks, has been shown to be an expert striker using his variation of the style, using his palm to slam opponents into the ground using the back of their heads.
James Lee: Defensive Attacks
James has been seen to be able to utilise his attacks defensively, unlike others. He is able to deflect attacks used on him and escape tough situations with his great flexibility and speed. It is also seen that he actively targets an opponent's vital points, such as the temple and gut. His style revolves around using kicks.
Sinu Han: Hybrid Attacks
Sinu Han uses a hybrid style, where he utilises both the legs and hands, to attack the face and chin. He is the only one in the 2nd Generation who is able to use such attacks.

is an extremely rare ability, where the user can hit their opponent quickly and precisely enough to make it appear as if the hit was invisible.
Explanation
The technique consists of hitting your opponent in a blind spot quickly, causing this impression of invisibility. To achieve this, the user must at least have
Speed ​​Mastery
, and possibly
Technique Mastery
.
Thanks to this, the Invisible Strike becomes a technique that borders on guaranteed success, being extremely difficult to counter for most people, requiring at least the individual to have overcome the wall once (like
Eli Jang
and
Warren Chae
for able to see
Sinu Han
's blows
[
1
]
). The ease (or difficulty) of seeing the blow being delivered can also increase, depending on how experienced and powerful the user becomes, for example,
Seongji Yuk
can only see
James Lee
's blows after achieving Mastery for the third time (this being the Mastery of Speed
[
2
]
).
Users
As it is a technique applicable to different types of attacks, its users deal with Invisible Strike in different ways.
Charles Choi
The first user we know of, chronologically. While it is unknown when or how he achieved Invisible Strike, Charles fights with this ability in a direct and strategic way, it is also unknown how he fought with Invisible Strike before losing his arm.
Diego Kang
Presumably achieved with talent, Diego Kang (once known as James Lee) fights with Invisible Strike in a clean and acrobatic manner, preferring to use kicks over punches, even commonly fighting with his hands in his pockets.
Sinu Han
Achieved during the tortuous years he was in the Circus, Sinu Han used to fight as he had learned from fighting in the streets, however, after years of fighting in the Circus and achieving the Invisible Strike, Sinu begins to refine his attacks, delivering both punches and kicks indiscriminately during his fights, including having several deadly techniques up his sleeve mixed with his invisible blows.

Synopsis
Episode 214
Jace
is horrified to find out that
Vasco
has no plans for the future. He drags him around the different departments where Vasco finds out everyone has a plan for when they graduate, even the bullies.
Gordon Park comes across the principal, who is very disappointed in the chaotic behavior of the architecture students. He warns Mr. Park to get them under control or he will be fired. When he hears that
Jasmine Huh
has lost her wallet he decides to do a locker sweep to catch the person who stole it.
The architecture students are surprised Mr. Park would suspect them. Vasco does not believe any one of them is guilty, and encourages the homeroom teacher to expel the culprit if he finds them. He is shocked to find Jasmine's wallet is in his locker, and Mr. Park decides to expel him.
Episode 215
Jace
sets out to prove
Vasco's
innocence. His suspects include everyone who was not present at the mandatory lecture that the school attended:
Zack
,
Yui
,
Logan
, Jay-Gal,
Vin
,
Mary
and Gordon Park. He begins collecting evidence and realizes everyone has an alibi.
Gordon Park claims he was in the room picking up a textbook. Yui went to the bathroom to wash her face and stayed in the classroom because she was sick; she also went to the nurse and got some pills. Zack claims he went on a date with Mira and heard a loud noise.
Yui also claims she heard
Duke
singing, but Duke was at the lecture. Mary claims she was at the lecture and Vin claims he went to the cafeteria with Mary. Logan says he went to the nurse's office and Jay-Gal laughs like a psychopath. Jace decides that all of the suspects are lying.
Episode 216
Jace decides Gordon Park is lying because he was in the room and he did not leave after getting the book. Yui is lying because she was still wearing makeup despite washing her face. Zack was clearly asleep, because
Mira
would never ask him on a date. Logan was not in the nurse's log, so he also lied. Vin and Mary's stories contradict each other, but the cafeteria lady did confirm Vin came with a girl to the café.
Jace is upset and thinks he can't solve a case when he remembers his grandfather's advice: always go to the crime scene. He comes across the
Burn Knuckles
destroying the place and finds a small gem. He sees a CD in the room and puts everything together. Jace goes to the homeroom teacher's office and declares the culprit.
Episode 217
Jace explains that Yui did go to the bathroom, but not to wash her face. Her pills were laxatives, and the noise Zack heard was her going to the toilet. She is acquitted. The singing that Yui heard was not Duke but his CD Vin listened to in the bathroom; he is also acquitted. Zack is acquitted because he was clearly asleep.
Mary is acquitted because she was at the lecture at the time. Logan claims he did it but Jay-Gal denies it, saying the reason Logan was absent was to give Zoe a picture he drew of her. He leaps out the window with Jay-Gal and the both of them are acquitted. Mr. Park is also acquitted, because Jace only saw him looking, and he did nothing more.
The real culprit was
Jasmine Huh
. She lies about being rich and then placed her wallet in Vasco's locker to pretend her money was stolen. She pretended to be Mary and went with Vin to the café, but he didn't notice because his glasses were too dark. The last piece of evidence is the small gem from her headband she left at the crime scene. Jasmine is revealed to be a mythomaniac, a perpetual liar. Jace ends the case happy with himself, and with a bunch of new enemies.
Cookie is Gordon Park giving Jasmine her wallet with all the money in it. He placed his own money in there because he genuinely believed Jasmine lost her money, and complains that his wife will be mad.
Later, a weirdo wearing a stocking mask tries to sell an internet café computer to some strangers. When they refuse him he beats them with a keyboard and escapes the scene. He is approached by members of Hostel, and removes his mask to reveal himself as
James Gong
.
Episode 218
Zoe
is walking to school when a man asks to buy her spit. She runs away and the man is pursued by Logan, who beats him senseless. At school the fashion boys are shocked to hear the news, and Jace explains olfactophilia and the money it generates. Jace mentions he is looking into it because he is trying to find information about Hostel, now that
Daniel
decided to go against the Big 4 crews.
Jasmine is still lying about her life and Zack is annoyed. Mira tells him the story of the boy who cried wolf and tells him to have faith in Jasmine. Jasmine takes a photo with Mira and uses it to sell spit to strangers. When one asks to see her in person, she takes Mira on a shopping trip and pretends to be her courier. She hands the spit to her client, a juvenile lawyer. They run into Zack, but he walks past them.
Jasmine takes Mira home and laughs about the scam she pulled. The lawyer grabs her face and orders her to take back her spit. Zack approaches them both and reveals he saw everything that happened.

episode
29
Jace Park (박범재 Park Bum Jae)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He is a student in the architecture department at Jae Won high school and Vice-leader of Burn Knuckle.
Appearance
Jace is a young man with a petite stature, and, like his friend Vasco, has a fit body because they trained very hard together. He has big ears, and has a bird tattooed on his chest and "My Hero Man ET" tattooed on his arm. ET stands for his best friend's real name; Euntae.
Personality
Along with Vasco, Jace had great admiration for super heroes. During middle school, Jace had distanced himself from Vasco because he wasn't as loyal to him.
After he realized his mistake, he became a very loyal friend. He was so loyal that he got himself tattooed to cover Vasco's scars and remove his fear of sharp objects.
He is also smart, considering that he is the brains behind the Burn Knuckles.
Fighting Prowess
While he has not participated in many fights Jace Park is a very skilled fighter. It was stated in chapter 252 he was the only one who kept up with Vasco's workouts. Jace has also shown to fight unfairly and ruthlessly during his fight with a former bully in chapter 57.
Quotes
It's because she was your 'first' love. - Episode 29, Jace to
Woong.

Background
Jace and Vasco were childhood friends. When they were both young, they played with their "Hero Man" figurines. While playing Vasco would often question Jace about why the Hero Man would use his role as a superhero. However, despite being annoyed by these questions and hitting Vasco, both become good friends.
After reaching middle school, Jace mingled with 3 other students in their class. Jace, Vasco, and the three other students meet three upperclassmen bullies. When asked to smoke, Jace was interrupted from accepting the cigarette when Vasco told him smoking was bad. Embarrassed, the three bullies starting picking on Vasco, and despite watching this all happen Jace didn't do anything, The two friends starting growing and Jace soon started to ignore Vasco's suffering. Even after witnessing Vasco crying by himself, Jace ran away. Afterwards, Vasco disappeared from school and Jace was forced to bring him back or take his place in getting bullied.
Jace saw all of the crude tattoos and wounds Vasco had received from the bullies and went to school telling the bullies Vasco was sick. This angered them and he was threatened until Vasco showed up. Vasco and the bullies started fighting but he was quickly overpowered. Jace begged the bullies to stop but all they did was beat him. Cicada, another student the bullies picked on arrived with his cousin, Goo, who preceded to beat all the bullies.
After all the bullies were forced to move from the school, Jace finds out that Vasco had developed Aichmophobia, the phobia of sharp objects. To help his friend, Jace got a tattoo of a bird on his chest. Later Jace is seen to have a tattoo saying "My Hero Man ET." When questioned by Vasco why he had ET tattooed, Jace replied that he really liked the movie. However, it is revealed that ET stood for Euntae, who was Jace's hero man.
Plot
Jace was first introduced in Lookism as Vasco's second in command. He initially did not like Daniel Park, because he was causing trouble in J High. After seeing Daniel become interested in the Burn Knuckles, he became more accepting of him. When Daniel first began training with Vasco, Jace did not approve of Daniel because he thought he would quit soon. However, Daniel was persistent in his training and proved Jace wrong, so he started to warm up to little Daniel, even calling him a friend.
Jace and the Burn Knuckles show up a lot in the story to help Vasco in his battles. The first battle they appeared in was the Secondhand Rana arc, where they helped Vasco fight against Woojin's gang. They also attacked by the God Dogs, but they refused to fight until Vasco gave them the order. When Vasco pretended to be a runaway, Jace gathered the Burn Knuckles to look for him. They found Riley Oh instead, and he was arrested by the police.
When Vasco was framed for stealing Jasmine's wallet, Jace was the one who convicted Jasmine for lying. He became interested in Hostel once he discovered people from Hostel bought Jasmine's paraphernalia and sold it to perverts. He decided to help Daniel destroy the four gangs, telling him he would need a lot more help than before. He was smart enough to challenge Jin Jang's analysis of the J High kids, and the latter marked Jace as his first target to destroy.
Jace visited Cheonliang with Vasco to gain information on Hostel, but he became distracted when he fell in love with a girl on the train. The girl was a Hostel member, and Jace feared she would be used in a prostitution scam. Vasco missed the train, but Johan offered to help Jace under the terms of a contract. The two of them found the girl, and went their separate ways. Jace reunited with Vasco and started dating the girl from the train.

Incheon isn't as gentle as Cheonliang, got it?
"
—Jaegyeon Na to James Lee  in
episode 493
Jaegyeon Na
is a member of the
1st Generation
and King of Incheon.
Appearance
Jaegyeon Na is very tall, being shown to be of similar height to
Taesoo Ma
, and towering over
Daniel Park
. He has blonde hair with brown roots styled in a middle part, with rather prominent eyelashes. He seems to have a preference for expensive clothing, wearing light blue jeans secured with a luxury-brand belt, a white dress shirt with a popped collar, and several pieces of jewelry around his neck, particularly a chain, a beaded necklace, and a pendant.
Personality
Jaegyeon Na has a cool, quirky, and also somewhat childish personality. He has a strong favor toward racing cars with childish stickers choice. However, his reckless driving often leads to his fellow kings destroying his car during their meetings. They criticize his car as crummy or claim that a driver like him deserves it, which ends up enrages him. In response, he forces them to pay for the damage or even buy the car. He even once persistently pressures Daniel Park to buy his car and falsely accuses him of damaging it, despite it only being lightly touched by his back by accident.
At one point, his tolerant comes to an end, as he no longer withstand to see his car destroyed. His usually demeanor gives way to an unusual vindictive side, and almost starts a fight between five province kings. It becomes clear that the only thing capable of triggering his anger is his car.
History (optional)

Jaesu Noh
is a secondary character, a member of Team Shin Sera in the White Tiger Job Center
Appearance
In the single panel we've seen of his past, his mullet was much longer, and he was very well-built.
Jaesu is a shorter man with black hair in a short mullet. He wears a green cap with a yellow logo, a brown plaid collared shirt, a blue jacket with the plaid pattern on the breasts, dark pants, and a pair of low-top blue shoes with white soles (Possible slippers).
Personality
Jaesu's personality hasn't been shown too much, given his quick introduction and defeat.
Relationships
Tom Lee
Both seem to know each other well, with Jaesu being part of Tom's organization, in addition to having already fought together in the Gapryong Fist.
Synopsis
Workers (1st Affiliate)
Jaesu appears with Team Sera Shin to defeat the Allied members in the 1st affiliate, slamming
Jerry Kwon
into the ground. However, this soon proves to be a bad match-up as Jerry gets back up and lifts Jaesu into the air with one hand, choking him out before he gets slammed into the ground, knocking him out of the fight.
Fighting Prowess
Jaesu Noh is someone considerably strong, taking into account that he is a member of the 0th Generation.
He's a typical strongman who's wrestled dozens of bulls. His one weakness is his bad luck.

“
Oh, they're not extras?
”
Jake Kim
(김기명 Kim Gimyeong)
is the son of
Gapryong Kim
and leader of the West River Gang,
Big Deal
.
Appearance
Jake Kim is described to be handsome, with a tall slender figure. Although he's been shown to have a range of expressiveness within his face, usually his eyebrows always look raised, and a calm expression. His hair is black and his eyes are a deep brown.
Throughout the series, he cycles through 3 different hairstyles. From his introduction, he has the typical hair length of a Korean male, that is slicked to the side of his forehead. When brought back to the story in the
Juvenile Prison Arc
, he has an edgar-style haircut. By the end of the arc,
[
8
]
his hair is grown out into a spiky style. However, it turns back to a buzzcut.
He gains a scar after fighting
Gun
that stretches from his cheek to his lip (in the game, he does not possess a scar).
[
9
]
He gained another scar across his nose when he fought
Xiaolong
in the 3rd Affiliate arc.
Personality
Jake is a charming and charismatic individual who, initially, is polite to everyone he meets. He is able to win Jiho's trust easily and his accomplice Jiho mistakes him for a friend, until he reminds him that they are business partners. During the Jake Kim Arc it is revealed his disdain for gangs because of his relationship to his father whom Jake described as a gang leader known for being just and fair to others but unfair to his own family.
During his middle school years he is laid back and doesn't care about being the leader of the school. Ironically, like his father he is someone who will not tolerate injustices and unfairness demonstrated when he fought the third years for "ganging up" on Brad and Jason when they were in middle school and fighting
Samuel Seo
to help the vendors of the street Big Deal is protecting.
To his allies, Jake is a caring leader. He fought hard to maintain Big Deal's independence, and they care about him deeply, making them one of the most loyal crews. He values people who are honest and fair, and does not like people who fight dirty.
During the series Jake noted himself that he began to sound like
Sinu Han
, the previous leader of Big Deal who showed Jake the value of "romance" and passion, and ideals which the latter follow.
Following his time in juvenile detention, Jake's personality began to change. He became callous to his initial ideas about fairness and is only focused on revenge.
As of the
One Night II Arc
, his sense of humor that he used to have in his past resurfaces. He makes some sneeze jokes, shows his butt to
Vivi
, and plays word chain with
Johan Seong
and
Daniel Park
while on duty as an undercover bouncer for Vivi's club. However, he still has his serious demeanor at the ready whenever he needs to, as he is looking for clues regarding Sinu Han's whereabouts.
Fighting Prowess
Jake Kim is among the most proficient fighters in the series utilizing a fighting style based off of MMA and his father's , Gapyrong Kim's, street fighting style. He is extremely skilled in combat and the third person to defeat
Euntae Lee
in the Webtoon (the others being
Daniel
and Gun). This is a relevant fact in the early series as it established the superiority of the
Four Major Crews.
Although it may be argued that Daniel may be faster, Jake defeated Euntae, who as Daniel stated before, was the second to visibly injure Gun. He was able to defeat
Xiaolong
, who was comparable to Gun in strength. And, as of chapter 388, blocked a kick from Sinu, who had "Invisible" kicks.
In the Hunt for Big Deal Arc, Jake held off (for a limited time) both Yuseong (an extremely powerful figure, as the Workers
version
of Gun Park) and Xiaolong (who was stated by Jake in the
Workers
: 3rd Affiliate Arc [who fought Gun in a brawl] and Old Face [who witnessed Gun 3 years back] to be on par with a
suppressed
Gun) | but Xiaolong only got stronger from there | (as so did Gun, who trains consistently to  surpass himself every day [but hasn't engaged in many fights for a while] ), but still performed well (albeit on the losing end), and once Yuseong left, Jake adapted to Xiaolong's fighting style and ending up cornering him. A testament to his durability and endurance is that he survived a fall from a school building after taking heavy blows from the weapon wielding Xiaolong and pure destructive power (as stated by Johan) of Yuseong and still willed himself to push forward and push back the police to keep Big Deal safe.
In chapter 461, Taejin Cheon stated that Jake Kim was stronger than that of Jerry Kwon by the looks of the damaged and beaten responders. And in the same chapter he seems to be working with
Allied
in the first affiliation or is probably a member of it.
The full extent of his power is revealed in Chapter 469 when he faces off against
Jinyoung Park
. After unlocking all the reserves of Gapryong's Blood/Genes, he now has both
Innate Strength
and completed the
Stage of Mastery
.
It is theorized that his true limit was already demonstrated vs Samuel Seo in Chapter 466 but it is to be confirmed the difference between the two states: Unconscious and Conscious. There is more evidence towards the two being identical as Jake called back to the Samuel Fight and wished for the same power vs Jinyoung before being wired to activate it.

Family
Gapryong Kim
Jake has a bad relationship with his father, as his father was always a good man to the public, but a bad man to his family, especially his mother.
Big Deal
Jerry Kwon
Jerry is Jake's second command. Jake is very kind to Jerry and often involved in his education he encouraged Jerry to be a modest student and to get along well with his classmates. He bought Jerry a bamboo flute so that he will not be reprimanded by his teachers and to practice the Jeongseon Arirang. Jerry is undeniably the most loyal member to Jake, he refuses to call anyone else " Sir" and will always follows Jake command without hesitation. He was known to be Jake's "sword" and when Jake lost to Gun he vowed to become stronger so that he can protect Jake.
Workers
Samuel Seo
Samuel and Jake have a rocky start, Samuel thought that Jake was acknowledged by the Big Boss of Big Deal because he personally sought Jake, whereas he was recruited by Big Deal second in command. After they were captured by Black Bear Gang where they were saved by Sinu Han the two began to acknowledge each other and become friends. When Samuel decided to go to Gangnam and start a gang there he recruited Jake to be his second in command but Jake refused, he told Samuel that he hated gangs and the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it is not a typical gang. During their conversation Jake told Samuel about his relationship with his father and his father's funeral, Samuel commented that big funerals are uncommon for most gangsters Jake told him the name of his father. Samuel was shocked and he began to despise Jake and their relationship become sour.
While Jake is known to be a caring leader, Samuel is ruthless and often clashes with Jake. Especially when Samuel decided to support Old Face in joining the four major crews after Sinu lost to Gun. When he resorted on using the girls who work in clothing stores to earn money and punishing them by not giving them food or drinks, Jake decided to face him, the two fought and Samuel was left unconscious.
During the fight Big Deal members as well as Gun thought that Samuel is vengeful towards Jake because he is the illegitimate son of Gapryong Kim but it was later revealed that he was jealous of Jake because he wanted to be Gapryong Kim's son. He saw a picture of his mom and Gapryong Kim together and thought that it must be his father so he changed himself from being a timid and bullied boy to a strong character so that his father would be pleased to see him when they met. When he met his real father and realized that he was just mistaken Samuel was embarrassed to admit that the "great" father he thought he have is far different from reality. He becomes resentful of Jake because he is the real son of Gapryong Kim and he was acknowledged by people he respect mainly Gapryong, Sinu, and Gun.
J High School
Jiho Park
Jake initially did not think much of Jiho. He used Jiho in his illegal betting ring and stole his money. When Jiho came to prison, Jake gave Jiho advice on how to survive. After seeing how powerful Jiho had become, Jake decided that his advice worked, and accepted Jiho into Big Deal.

Background
Jake Kim used to be third in command to Big Deal, and the leader of the YB division. When the leader of Big Deal attempted to sell the gang to the Workers gang, he fought for their right to be independent. Since then, Jake has been the leader of Big Deal.
He also used to be the main candidate for Gun's successor, and was tasked with uniting the four crews. After he disobeyed Gun's rules by running an illegal betting ring (which, ironically, was what he was using to make money to become Gun's successor), Gun beat Jake and removed his candidacy.
His father, Gapryong Kim, was a famous gangster, who Jake disliked because of his father's neglectful treatment of his mother. The reason he joined Big Deal was because it was not like a typical gang.

However, his resolve and views on his father change as he learns from his mother how Gapryong was incapable of ignoring others in need or injustices. This led Jake to confront Sinu and take up the role as Big Deal's leader after the former sold himself to
Workers
.
Illegal Toto Arc
He,
Jiho
, and two others met to discuss the wildly popular ladder betting game. However, he was brought into prominence when
Euntae
, trying to help out Jiho, attempted to fight him in order to convince him to give Jiho his money back.
Jace Park
attempted to convince Euntae not to fight after noticing that they were in "Big Deal" territory. However, this confrontation angered Jake, as he was insulted that Euntae thought that he would need his underlings. Euntae and Kim immediately begin to fight, and Euntae was later shown bleeding and utterly defeated. As Bum Jae was going to step in and fight himself, Gun arrives on the scene. After being informed that he was no longer a candidate for Gun's successor, Jake reveals that Gun runs an extortion ring, which angers him. Gun then proceeds to brutally defeat Jake, ripping out his teeth as a punishment for his insubordination.
Juvenile Prison (Arc)
Later, Jake is shown in a Juvenile Detention Center, vowing to himself that he will kill Gun. He is a major influence to Jiho and tells him that the only way he will win against opponents stronger than himself is if he resorts to fighting to the death. He later reveals that this advice was not meant for Jiho but for himself, as he believes the only way he will win against Gun is if he fights him to the death.
Jake Kim (Arc)
This is a flashback arc and takes place a few years before the start of the series.
Jake is the unofficial leader of his middle school. When second year transfer students
Brad Lee
and
Jason Yoon
are ganged up on by the third years, Jake steps in and beats all of the third years because he liked the gum they gave him. Later, Jake is directly contacted by the leader of
Big Deal
,
Sinu Han
and is invited to join the gang. Jake refuses, stating his dislike of gangsters.
Samuel Seo
finds out that Sinu contacted Jake personally and not him, and goes to beat Jake to prove his strength. Jake and Samuel fight in a street that Big Deal protects. In the middle of their fight, the Black Bear Gang shows up and threatens them. Samuel, Jake, Brad, Jason,
Jerry Kwon
and
Alexander Hwang
tell the gang that they are Big Deal. The Black Bear members chase them down and capture them. Before the Black Bears can kill them, Sinu shows up to save them. He asks the leader of the Black Bears if he can handle the repercussions of killing the leader of Big Deal. He lets the boys go, and Sinu is shown visibly shaking afterwards, although the boys now have a great deal of respect for him.
Sinu celebrates saving them with a feast on the aforementioned street. Samuel is eager to join, but Jake is still reluctant to join Big Deal. He comes back later and joins along with Brad, Jason and Jerry, likely due to Sinu breaking his preconceptions of what a gangster was.

Synopsis
Episode 302
Jake Kim
is introduced as the king of C Middle School. Brad Lee and Jason Yoon are two of his juniors trying to usurp him from the throne by beating every student in their grade. However, Jake decides not to fight them, and they end up gifting him some gum. The other students come for revenge against the two, and Jake ends up saving them for the favor they did earlier. The two swear to follow Jake wherever he goes. As he's leaving the school, he runs into
Sinu Han
, the leader of
Big Deal
.
Episode 303
Sinu asks Jake to join his gang, but Jake refuses because he hates thugs. Sinu also sent his second in command Old Face to recruit
Samuel Seo
, leader of the Gangseo Alliance. Jake and his crew are wandering down a street that is owned by Big Deal, and learn about the rivalry between them and the Black Bear Gang, run by adults. Samuel surrounds them with his gang and challenges Jake to a fight, saying he wants to prove who is the stronger of the two. He is jealous that Sinu acknowledged Jake and not himself. Jerry Kwon rolls up with his bicycle to join the battle.
Episode 304
The Gangseo alliance begin fighting with Jake's crew. Despite their small numbers, they are doing well for themselves. Jason Yoon is called Jeju's Crimson Stallion due to his fancy kicks, and Brad Lee is called Gangwon's Hippo because of how he locks onto opponents. They mistake Jerry for Jake's father, although Jerry is younger than Jake. None of the students want to get close to Jake and Samuel, who are throwing heavy punches at each other. Alexander tries to encourage Samuel to fight like his gangster father, and Jake mentions how he hates his father, who is also a gangster.
Amidst the fight the Black Bear crew pull up, and order the students to stop fighting. Most of the kids flee, except Jake's friends and Samuel and Alexander. The crew asks who they are, and they say they are from Big Deal, in an effort to appear tough.
Episode 305
When the Black Bear gang try to fight them, the kids decide to run, but they ran in the direction of the Black Bear gang's territory. They are caught and tied in the gang's pool as they interrogate them. Jason and Brad quickly confess to not being Big Deal, but the gang leader decides to kill them anyway to spare his reputation. Jake offers to go first, but before they load him into their van, Sinu Han appears to rescue them.
Episode 306
Sinu blackmails the leader with a Newtube video he made, explaining that he will save the kids captured by Black Bear. If Sinu doesn't return, the video will be uploaded and they will gain a reputation as child killers. When they escape from their territory, Jake and the others learn Sinu was posturing the entire time. He invites them to come eat with him.
Alexander begins bragging that Samuel is the son of a gangster, and Jerry blurts out that Jake's father was also a gangster. Then he asks why Sinu is protecting this particular street, and he tells him the girls who work there are really pretty. Jake is angered by this and dumps his food before leaving. He remembers that his father used to cheat on his mother, and he is disappointed Sinu is like that. Samuel doesn't seem to mind, remembering that his father would say similar things.
As Jake sits down to think, he is approached by one of storeowners, a girl called Yeonhui. She tells Jake that he is wrong about Sinu, and that he was only joking. Sinu has been protecting her street ever since he was a child, and he usurped the previous owner so he would have the manpower to continue doing so. The people on the street came to know of him as the "Boy of Promise", and they pay him a fee out of their own gratitude. Jake decided to visit Big Deal once more, and along with Samuel, they became members.
On a rainy day, Jerry was walking back from school. He came across Johan Seong passed out in the floor, and recognizes him from the news.
Episode 307
Samuel Seo is patrolling the streets after becoming Big Deal's number three. He smacks a man who forgot to wear his jacket, and Sinu isn't pleased with it. He feels that Samuel is not being a good leader, but Old Face disagrees. When Samuel comes to the clothing store, he notices that the girls are distracted. He finds them surrounding Johan, who was brought in by Jerry Kwon after he decided to make him a member of Big Deal. Samuel tells Jerry they don't have money for new members, but Jerry insists that he will let him stay until Jake complains. Johan tearfully decides to leave, and the girls complain at Samuel, saying Johan is only trying to take care of his mother. Samuel tells Johan that he needs to toughen up if he is going to survive, and he recommends stealing shoes to make quick money. Sinu gives Johan some money on the way out, and Jerry wonders if he will see him again.
Meanwhile, Jake is accosted by Olly Wang, who is eager to join Big Deal. Jake asks Olly why he wants to join, seeing as he isn't from a poor family. Heather apologizes for him and berates Olly for joining. Jake tells Olly he might let him join some other day, as he reminds him of himself.
The Big Deal members decide to have some fun on the beach. Samuel asks Jake how long he plans to stay in Big Deal, as Sinu is going to retire soon. He plans to head to Gangnam later, because Big Deal is too idealistic and small to suit him. He asks Jake to come with him, but he refuses. He says the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it wasn't like the other gangs. He resented his father for not caring about his family. Samuel is curious to know who his father is, and he tells him it is Gapryong Kim. Samuel's cigar slips out of his finger, because that is the name of the man he suspects is his father.
Late at night, Goo barges into Big Deal's store, asking if Sinu would like to join one of his four major crews. Gun is annoyed by his loudness, and Sinu is shocked and worried to see Goo.
Episode 308
Goo attempts to introduce himself, but Sinu hits him and tells the others to get back, because he is much stronger than him. Goo begins fighting Sinu, but Sinu's punches are actually doing damage. Big Deal are surprised to see Sinu fighting this hard. Sinu heard from other gangs that they have been defeated by Goo as a test, and his friend Jagalchi told him that he needs to be prepared for this. Sinu tries his best, and Gun feels as though he might be able to beat Goo. Goo takes the chopsticks Sinu was eating with and sharpens them into a weapon, which he begins slashing him with. As Sinu is being beaten, Goo tries to stab him, but Jake catches his hand with the chopsticks. Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.
Episode 309
Gun tells Big Deal that they made the cut, and he expects a 100 million won by the end of the month. The leaders of the gang sit down to discuss their prospects. Old Face proposes using the girls to make a profit, and Jason adamantly opposes it. Jake gets up to leave the meeting, saying they shouldn't make a decision without Sinu present. Samuel also disagrees, saying he will find a way to make the money himself.
When Jake goes to meet Samuel, he is standing by the lighthouse. Jake asks how he plans on making the 100 million won. Samuel tells him to get lost, because he can't stand seeing Gapryong's son. He is jealous of Jake, but he isn't aware of why.
Later, Goo and Gun come to a warehouse to collect their dues. Jake and his crew attempt to stop them, but Goo notices that they have the money needed. Samuel tells Goo that the money is ready to be collected, and kicks it before he can count it. He tells Goo that he has to test him before he can hand him the money. Black Bear gang are upset that Gun and Goo are trying to take down their enemies, and have decided to step in to assert their dominance.
Episode 310
Samuel has a flashback to when he asked the Black Bear gang to help him. He used the stores as collateral to ask for a loan of the Black Bear gang: they would pay the stores, and in return the gang would help them defeat Goo and Gun. However, he bet that Gun and Goo would defeat them, and in return he would not have to pay a cent. Gun is impressed by his foresight and wants to congratulate him, but Samuel gives Old Face the credit of the plan. Jake is disgusted by Samuel and decides to leave, reminded of his own father. The Black Bear gang eventually goes out of business.
Goo heads to a house in a neighborhood, where he finds Charles Choi sitting on the ground with a few others. He greets the workers head, who has just managed to make a name for his gang. There is also another person in the room: James Lee, one of the ten geniuses.
Episode 311
Samuel takes control of Big Deal, and orders one of his members to refuse the girls food unless they reach their quota. He asks if the others will listen to someone other than Jake, and Samuel beats him in a rage. He discusses his decision with Old Face, who agrees happily with the decision. Sinu pulls up on them and punches Old Face. He asks why Samuel has gone from being ambitious to leading with cruelty. Samuel reminds Sinu of his favoritism towards Jake, and tells him he isn't needed in Big Deal anymore. Jason and Brad prepare to leave Big Deal, but Jerry refuses to leave until Jake returns.
Sinu meets Jake at the lighthouse and tells him he has a plan to beat Gun, but Jake is skeptical. Sinu asks if he is hesitant to fight because of his father. Jake tells him he is correct, that he is trying to avoid the drama. Sinu tells him he doesn't have to join Big Deal, but he would like him to at least protect the storeowners, since he isn't strong enough to. Jake comes back to his mother's house and asks what kind of father he was. His mother confirms that he was a piece of shit, but would do his best to help those less fortunate than himself.
Jake comes back to Big Deal to find Samuel beating Jerry, who is trying to protect the girls. He tells Samuel he has never decided who the leader is, and while he dislikes fighting for passion, that he will do so regardless. Gun is sitting on a bench to watch the fight.
Episode 312
Samuel has a flashback to when he first learned about his father. He created Gangseo Union so he could become a gangster like Gapryong Kim. He would follow him to  his campaigns and protect him from civilians who harassed him and were angry about his crimes. Samuel's hope was to become prominent enough to be able to approach Gapryong. When he came back from seeing Gapryong for the first time, his mother showed him his real father, an tradesman who abandoned his family a long time ago. The picture he cherished of Gapryong was taken by his real father during an outing with his mother. Gapryong also has a vasectomy, so he couldn't have children after Jake.
Samuel was so enraged he tried to choke his father. He made himself believe Gapryong was his father, because the alternative was too painful to bear. He never did get to meet Gapryong, and he is angry that Jake has the life he dreamed of. However, his emotions make Samuel unstable in the fight, and he ends up losing to Jake. Gun congratulates Jake on his victory. Sinu arrives at that moment to show Jake how to defeat Gun
Episode 313
Sinu folds and reveals that there isn't a way to beat Gun; he and Jake should just surrender. Jake is livid and tells Sinu to give him the secret, but he tells him to wait. Gun has given him a card to contact the Workers, saying that if he cannot deal with the crew, it is best he sell it. He tells his plan to Old Face, and he asks the members of Big Deal to join him. Most of them do, but Jason and a few others refuse to leave Big Deal. He calls Jerry and tells him to take care of Gangdong, so he isn't present for the selling of Big Deal. Yeonhui overhears him and realizes that Sinu doesn't plan on selling Big Deal, but selling himself. Old Face and his crew decide to take down Jake on the orders of Sinu. He and the YB crew defeat them, and Jake hurries to stop Sinu from selling the crew.
Episode 314
Jake doesn't believe that Sinu would sell Big Deal to the Workers, but he doesn't see through the lie yet. He tries to beat Sinu into shape, but he is too easy on Sinu. He beats him proper and tells him that he did sell the crew, for 100 million won. The leader of the workers actually decided to rate him 1 billion won, for his prowess against Goo. Sinu asked to raise it to 1.2 billion won, to last them one year. Sinu continues to egg Jake on, even saying that he doesn't need the girls because Gangnam girls are more attractive. Jake tries his best now, but he is still too weak, and is knocked out by Sinu.
Sinu gives Jake his jacket, and makes his way to the Workers. Their leader tells Sinu that he will now be considered property, and no longer allowed to contact anyone. He is now No. 8 in the Workers, and his office is a giant cage.
Episode 315
Jake is preparing to leave Big Deal when Yeonhui gives him a recording Sinu made and never uploaded. Jake learned about the plan to gain enough money, and that Sinu expects him to defeat Gun and Goo in his place. At the monthly deposit, Gun asks Jake if he will be able to buy Sinu back, given his cost of $5 billion won. Jake tells him to be quieter, because nobody knows of this except himself and the storeowners. The storeowners offer to help buy Sinu, but Jake refuses because they are like family to Sinu. Jake hears about a gambling scheme being held in Seoul, and he begrudgingly decides to accept the position.
Samuel is also trying to get stronger to defeat Jake. He begs Gun to give him a second chance to be his successor, and Gun tells him to make a name for himself with his Gangseo Union. Samuel decides to weed out his weaker members by beating them, hoping that Gun would be impressed by his smaller, stronger team. Gun is disgusted by his actions and beats Samuel, telling him that he still hasn't learned why he was disqualified in the first place. The Gangseo Union abandon Samuel, and he is confused as to why he wasn't accepted.
Samuel hunts down Johan to ask him why he wasn't accepted, but Johan tells him to get lost. Jake and Olly also arrive, and both are surprised to see Samuel there. Apparently Gun summoned the crew leaders to see who is the strongest of them all.
Episode 316
Gun and Goo make a bet for 10 billion won on who will win. Gun bets on Gapryong's son, who is incredibly strong, and Goo bets on Olly Wang, who cannot feel pain. Johan attacks Jake first, and he is surprised that Johan is the same kid who came to Big Deal. Jake tells Johan that he is too kind to join a gang, and he should return home. Johan asks Jake to bet that whoever loses gives their territory to the winner of the fight. Olly quickly dispatches of Samuel and tries to beat the other two, but they ignore him and fight each other.
Samuel is wondering why he lost so hard. Everyone he looked down upon is stronger than him; Johan who was a crybaby, Olly who was a loser, and Jake who he thought was beneath him. Goo goes to take a picture to show Gun who won the fight, and the scene he sees shocks him. Samuel has already beaten Johan and Jake, and he strangles Olly until he passes out. Goo asks why Samuel wants to Gun to approve of him so badly. He already approves of Samuel, and asks that he become his new secret friend.
Episode 317
Jake's friends begin asking about the numbers racket, and Jake refuses to tell him. He is losing money quickly, and the head of the scam slaps him and asks if he wants them to fail. He tells Jake that making money isn't easy, and he has to sacrifice something to get what he wants. Jake remembers Gun's offer to earn money by becoming his successor, and swallows his pride, deciding to continue the gambling scheme. Even though he sees the pain of the people getting scammed, he decides it is worth it if he can rescue Sinu and save Big Deal.
When Vasco came to demand Jiho's money, Jake was reminded of himself. However, even his attempts to earn money were shut down when Gun disqualified himself. Jake recalls all of this as he wakes up in present time. He commanded Lineman to bring every member of Big Deal so they can attack the Workers, and force Gun to show himself to them.
Episode 318
Samuel Seo, now promoted to the rank of President of the Fourth Affiliate of Workers, stops Jake and the rest of Big Deal as they are headed to confront Workers. The current generation of Big Deal members reveal that he is still renown for outsmarted Gun and Goo back when he was still a member. Samuel and Jake engage in witty banter as Samuel suggests they abandon their ideology of passion and join Workers and tells Jake to start working smarter rather than harder. The two continue to converse casually as they engage in a violent exchange of fists. Samuel claims that it is ridiculous to even consider attacking Workers, as that will only help Gun. He then asserts that the Big Four Crews were created as a means to an end, simply to provide the funds for someone's business. Now that someone wants the crews to disappear as they have begun to attract too much attention to themselves, mostly due to Daniel's movements against the crews. Samuel postulates that Gun has received an order to wipe out the crews, especially Workers, since they are aware of the only weakness of "that mysterious person", presumably Charles Choi. Samuel Seo then offers an alliance with Big Deal. Jake then moves towards the car, asserting that he should finally be able to meet the elusive head of Workers if he is here to form an alliance, and the shadowed face of the head is revealed within the car as Jake Kim peers through the open window.
Daniel Park is doing better for himself as he has continued to stream with Kwitch. His self-esteem is higher and his living conditions have improved. As he is streaming within his home, he absentmindedly asks his viewers if they have heard anything about the four major something, eluding to the Big Four Crews. As he ponders when he will finally get rid of the crews, the Chairman of H Group, Jay's dad, and his subordinates approach his neighborhood.
Episode 319
Jake Kim announces to Big Deal that he is forming an alliance with the Workers. He tells them that they need to ally with the Workers in order to defeat Gun, but he hides the fact that Sinu did not betray Big Deal. He changes into a new outfit to infiltrate the Workers by himself.
Daniel tells Steve Hong that Gun and Goo are the two responsible for forming the four major crews, and that the four crews are comprised of minors. Hong offers Daniel an alliance to defeat the crews by offering him money, but Daniel is skeptical and refuses him. Then Hong offers him the chance to change his life, and the location of the third affiliate: Club Vivi. Daniel dresses up using Jay's clothing to enter the club, but he is rejected due to his looks. As he sits with the other rejected members of the club, they see Xialong carrying Vivi into the club, with the guards bowing before them. Daniel recognizes that the guards are wearing gold badges of the Workers. He returns to tell Hong that he was blocked from entering due to discrimination. Hong tells Sophia to make Daniel lose 90lbs by any means possible.
Tom Lee enters a bar to speak with the chairman of Workers, who is calling from a cell phone elsewhere. The chairman tells him to send his men back to the Workers, and Tom says his company only works for payment, mentioning Choi's offer of a new building. The chairman offers him even more money than Choi, so Tom decides to send an intern (Johan Seong) to the third affiliate.

James Gong (공영훈 Gong Yeong Hun)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He debuts in the
Fake Bank Account Arc
as a friend to
Jiho
, and later becomes an antagonist after
Daniel Park's Death
when Jiho pushes him and
Daniel
out of a window.
Appearance
James Gong is a relatively medium-height teenager that sports a white and yellow jacket, blue jeans and pink, blue, and black high-tops. He has black, unkempt hair and pale skin. He smokes during most of his panels and is implied to be a crazy person.
Personality
James Gong is a rebellious teenager who tends to act before he thinks. He is classified as a gangster and is part of a group most of the time. It is implied he enjoys breaking the law.According to Jiho, when they were in middle school, James was known as a troublemaker as he got expelled for starting a fire with schoolbooks.
Relationships
Jasmine Huh
Jasmine is one of his love interests. While he doesn't seem to show romantic interest in her, she daydreams about him when she is with Hostel.
Jiho Park
Initially, James is friendly to Jiho and befriends him. Jiho begins to trust James, and makes him a bank account under his name. James later betrays Jiho by selling the account, causing Jiho to cut off connections with him.
However, Jiho's attempt to get revenge on James with a box cutter causes Daniel to intervene, leading Jiho to get angry and push them both out of a fifth-story window. His arrest directly after this leads to him going to juvenile prison on the charge of attempted murder.
Synopsis
Fake Bank Account
James Gong is introduced after
Jiho
goes to the ATM and smokes while sitting down on the Bank Withdrawal.
He then spots Jiho walking outside as soon as possible before he immediately recognizes him after Jiho forgot to get his withdrawn money back as James takes it and thought that Ji Ho himself had gotten money for him.
He only wanted to be friends with Jiho only to borrow money from his account,
He later spots James and his friends outside a bar, asking Jiho if he wanted to drink beer.
Jiho creates a bank account for him as a gift, which James then sells to pay debt, which leads to the account being used for scamming.
After the Bank Fiasco, James as well as
Daniel
got pushed from the 5-story building from Jiho, because of his jealousy for Daniel, and for his anger that James wouldn't pay him back.
Runaway Fam Arc
James is later seen hanging around with The Mole Family, the one Daniel saw before. Sammy and Gerry began a 'reform stream', where they were going to turn criminals for good. The camera fell and it is implied by the punching that the stream failed. James then steals the camera and their car, plus a claw machine with dolls in it.
Soon later, he then stole food from a funeral home along with a commission box. Jasmine however managed to get him away unsuspected. Later, he and The Mole went to the building where the main Uncles and Big Daddy was. He however ignored any sign of precaution and honked until
Olly Wang
jumped and attacked him. James was then assumed to sign for the 3rd Uncle and was set to fight Chuck Kwak and won with tactics and a brick. James then earned the role though was unaware of it and was offered a phone. However James decided to steal all the phones and drive away. He then met
Zack Lee
once again though he was punched in the face and got his cigarette stolen. He finally returned in a bus enraged by Zack to the point where he wants to kill him. He tried to drive Zack over but that failed due to Daniel shoving Zack out of the way and
Jay
saving Daniel. James then tried to smash Zack's head in with the sledgehammer but failed due to Jay using a helmet to protect his head and then using it on James' head and hitting it multiple times. James then gave up and drove away, not before telling Zack that he promises to kill him.
Fighting Prowess
James does not have a specific martial art ability, but has shown to impress Hostel leader Olly Wang through his "creativity." He has often used cheap tricks to win a fight as using nearby weapons to surprise his opponents. James also has impressive strength as shown when he was able to knock back Hostel Uncle Chuck Kwak a considerable distance with his left hand (specifically his middle finger). James finally displays an unnatural endurance given his ability to survive beatings from Jay and Zack Lee while getting up.

Synopsis
Episode 354
Zack
and
Vasco
ask
Daniel
why he disappeared with the Workers, and he is saved by
Zoe
telling him the teacher wants to see him. The teacher tells him that a student will come to the class, and it may cause issues in the class.
Hostel
ask
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
why they let Workers get away with using
Olly's name
for their meeting. Justin and Chuck apologize to Hostel for saying it was their fault Olly died, and that they run illegal errands for
the Workers
now. They wanted to meet with Hostel because they suspect that Olly Wang died partly because of the pills he was taking, pills they suspect came from the Workers. They offer to work as double agents to fill Hostel in on what is going on inside the Workers.
At Gangseo,
Jake
tells the highest members of
Big Deal
to not mess with Workers, and to relay that to the lower members.
Brad
asks Jake why they would work with such an immoral organization, and he apologizes for being a bad leader.
Jerry
asks Jake not to lie to them anymore, and that they want to share the burden Jake is holding on to. Jake decides to tell them the truth about
Sinu
.
At the school, Zoe and
Mira
ask Daniel why the teacher wanted to see him. Just then
the teacher
announces that a student will be coming in the class, that student being
Jiho Park
. He is on leave because his grandmother died, and he wanted to apologize to Daniel during his break.
Episode 355
Jiho
apologizes to
Daniel
for pushing him, blaming it on his insecurities. Before Daniel can get angry,
the teacher
thanks Jiho and tells the class he will be returning to prison shortly afterwards. Daniel wonders if Jiho has truly changed. As they are stepping out, Jiho asks the prison guard if he can use the bathroom. He runs into some old bullies from school, who harass him before he beats them and locks them in a stall. While he is washing his hands of their blood, Daniel approaches and asks him if he is truly sorry for what he did. Jiho tells him he would have been sorry if it were Daniel, but that he is not sorry for
James Lee
that was pushed. Driving back from school, the officer tells Jiho he will take him straight home. Jiho asks if he can meet someone and the officer obliges, saying he should make the most of his time outside of jail.
At the
Workers's
headquarters, Daniel asks
Eugene
when he can enter the second affiliate, but Eugene doesn't trust him yet. He upholds his end of the bargain and tells Daniel the story of James Lee and the History of Fists. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.
Jiho approaches
Big Deal
and asks to see
Jake
. One of the gangsters looks down on him, so he stabs him in the eye with the man's cigarette. Jake comes out with the commotion and asks if Jiho did that. Jiho says he kept his promise to Jake, and Jake asks him again.
Episode 356
Jiho
tells him he did that and
Jake
slaps him, saying that the guy he attacked was weaker than him. Jiho tells Jake that he knows the reason he held onto him was so he could destroy the four crews. Jiho tells Jake that he has gotten help from
James Lee
of the first generation, and Jake tells him not to disappoint him. Jiho calls his officer saying he has nobody left to call.
At Gangnam,
Goo
and
Gun
are partying in costumes. Goo recalls that they used to party like that in Ansan as well, and Gun asks about the Ansan kids, who may have been a crew if they were in Seoul. In the Jung-gu district of Seoul, the
Ansan Public
gang arrive looking for James Lee. They enter a club and are unimpressed, except for
Jacky
who does not care. They chastise the girls, which brings the club owners running.
Hudson
explains that their club is terrible, and Jacky offers to teach the owners how to run a club. The men get offended and start fighting, but the Ansan crew defeats them easily. A newcomer arrives, and the Ansan crew welcomes James Lee.
Episode 357
Darius
kisses Hudson's hand and he realizes that his voice doesn't match the one on the phone.
Jacky
leaps on Darius's shoulders and asks if he can deal with the imposter and
Ethan Hwang
barges in, saying that they are looking for a leader. Darius explains that he works for
James Lee
and is representing him in his absence. He says James Lee wants to unite the crews, and he wants to team up with
Ansan
to do it. The team find is amusing, and give Darius three conditions: first, that they decide where to start the crew business. Second, that they take 50% of the profits. Third, that they get half of Seoul, since they are seniors of the first generation. Darius is unhappy with the deal but Ethan reminds him that Ansan and other crews are not at the same level as Seoul crews.
Jacky tries to lure runaways in Gangdong but
Max
and
Derrick
threaten to fight him.
Channing
comes to the Architecture department at
J High
and asks to see
Vasco
.
The Burn Knuckles
apologize for any misdoings he may have done and welcome him, but Channing only wants to see Vasco. He beats them and tattooes their bodies so Vasco will come.
Hudson
confronts
Johan
walking his dogs and asks him to give Gangbuk to him.

Johan tells Hudson he can have Gangbuk if he wants. He went to a doctor earlier who told him he was losing his eyesight in the same manner as his mother, and he should not exploit them. If he doesn't find treatment, he will go blind permanently.
Jiho asks the prison guard is he's heard of James Lee before, and the guard finds it amusing. He says it doesn't matter since he is going back to prison, and laments that he did not get to go to the funeral of his grandmother. Jiho admits to the prison cop that he lied about his grandmother's death: he got his friends to fake the paperwork. Darius blocks the windshield of the car and leaps off just before the prison guard drives into a truck. Jiho steps out and tells the prison guard he didn't do anything wrong, so he doesn't deserve to go back to prison.
Hudson has finished clearing out another karaoke club, one that he finds decent enough to run. The rest of Ansan Public arrive, waiting for James Lee to arrive. Jiho arrives with Darius and Ethan, calling himself James Lee.
Daniel is hanging out in DG's club that he owns. Daniel asks if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee.
Episode 359
Daniel asks how he knows about the two bodies, and DG tells he's known since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.
DG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by
Gapryong Kim
, who was known as the "Legendary Fist". The crews at this time were called "fists", and the crew heads were called "bosses", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called "circles". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of
Charles Choi's
geniuses
, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.
After announcing himself, Channing picks up Jiho and threatens to draw on him, and Jiho threatens to stab his eye with a toothpick. Jacky calms them down and Jiho tells Ansan Public that they need to stop pretending they care about James Lee, when they're only using his name as a reason to advance into Seoul territory. Hudson gives Jiho a score of 100 points and decides to listen to his offer. Jiho says he wants to start a crew called "James Lee". He can fill the members with Backdoor if Ansan will take care of the finances. Ansan reveals they want to start a private bar recruiting runaway kids from Gangdong. Channing will take care of the police and Jacky will take care of the workers. Jiho accepts and the James Lee crew is formed.
At J High, the students are discussing the news that Jiho was in an accident and escaped. Daniel and Zack talk about it when Eli comes in and annoucnes that Max and Derrick were attacked from James Lee, a guy who
Mr. Carpenter
knows well. Daniel mentions that Jiho might be involved in this matter, and Zack says if Jiho is involved, they also have to get involved.
Eugene in his hot ride calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.

Synopsis
James Lee (Arc)
When Ansan Public came to Seoul, they wanted to meet James Lee. Jiho Park pretended to be James Lee so he could hold a meeting with them. He proposed an alliance with Ansan where they would be able to use James Lee's name in order to maintain status and power, while Jiho would provide them assistance in running their legal and illegal businesses. Jiho Park offered to use his Backdoor members as forces for Ansan, while Ansan agreed to setting up business to create profit for Backdoor.
One Night III
When DG heard about the James Lee Crew using his name, he set off to prevent them from doing so. Daniel Park and his friends also went to attack the crew since they heard they were causing trouble.

—Jasmine Huh  in
episode TBA
Jasmine Huh (허영미
Heo Yeong Mi
)
is a student of the fashion department of
J High School
.
Appearance
Jasmine is a young teenage girl with straight black hair, black eyes and a pink bow on top of her head. She is also shorter than average. She seems to wear somewhat feminine clothes possibly to fit her “girly personality” or persona.
Personality
Jasmine appears as docile, nice and a sweetheart, although in her true colors, she isn't what she seems. She is actually somewhat selfish and extremely rude, especially to her father.
Jasmine is a
mythomaniac
, which means someone who feels compelled to tell lies and exaggerate the truth.
[
1
]
Because of this, most people around her distrust her.
She is also greedy and goes to lengthy ways to simply make more money.
Relationships
Family
Jasmin's Dad
Jasmine is always rude to her father, despite of the fact that he acts caring. She is seen yelling at him. She claims that he is nice, except for when he is drunk. She says she is sexually abused at home. This is confirmed by an epilogue scene showcasing her father sniffing her blankets with a clear sex offender anklet shown.
J High School
Mira Kim
Jasmine takes advantage of the fact that Mira had given her a second chance to trust her. She uses their friendship to make money for herself.
Zack Lee
Jasmine is scared of Zack because he is one of the few people who confronts her about her lies. She also has a degree of trust in him, and confides in him about why she runs away from home, Although it was true, but she was only manipulating him.
Love Interest
James Gong
Jasmine has a crush on James and the two of them begin dating. She follows him wherever he goes.
Synopsis
Background
Jasmine lives with her father and does not seem to come from a well off family.
Jacedaichi Case Files
Jasmine appears as a student who looses her wallet that her father gave her, and turned out to be playing games when she framed
Vasco
to make it seem like he was the one who was the culprit.
When other students started to corner her for her story on her being loaded, she lied that she lost her wallet which, according to her, had money in it. But the truth was that it didn't. Her lie got out of hand and in a state of nervousness, hid it in a random locker she could find. That locker turned out to belong to
Vasco
. In the end,
Jace
was able to catch her as the culprit.
Later, Jasmine decides to sell paraphernalia using Mira's picture to pretend to be her. Zack catches Jasmine and tells her to never show her face around him. She disappears and he feels guilty about it.
Runaway Fam
Jasmine runs away from home and joins Hostel A. She falls in love with James Gong and assists him in his scams. Zack finds her and at first wants to take her back, but decides to leave her alone.
Hostel (Arc)
Zack goes to find Jasmine after her father tells him he misses her. He finds her and orders her to come with him, but she refuses because her father is a sex offender. Zack decides to let her go a second time.
After Hostel and J High fight, Jasmine is seen sewing clothes for the Eli Jang children on a bus, with James as the driver.

Daniel later reminisces that she never returned to class.

Synopsis
Episode 110
Jiho
had just gotten his mom to buy him a new Vibe limited edition backpack, and his friends were fawning over it. However, when Jiho was with
Jay
and
Daniel,
the girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Jiho thought it is because Jay and Daniel both had a lot of money to buy expensive clothes and silently berates them for not having to work hard to get expensive goods, even though his mother had bought him the backpack.
All of a sudden, Jiho notices that Jay had forgotten his wallet when he rushed over to Daniel's seat when Daniel said he didn't know how to do a problem. Jiho comments on how Jay's so good to Daniel it's ridiculous, running to him just because Daniel had called. Jiho is about to call out to Jay to tell him about his wallet, but decides to pocket it instead to play a prank on Jay.
Jiho, Jay and Daniel are later at the convenience store, and Jiho's thanking Jay for buying him a lot of snacks. Jay waves at him while Daniel translates that Jay's telling him it's fine and for him to eat up. The lady at the counter tells them it's 21500 won. When Jay reaches into his jacket to pay for the snacks, Jiho looks on expectantly, thinking he'll look ridiculous when he realizes his wallet's gone. However, Jay takes out his cell phone and pays with it instead. Jay and Daniel bow to the sales lady and leave.
Later, in the washroom, Jiho huffs, saying that it's no fun and that, if he had known, he would have just given Jay the wallet. He opens Jay's wallet to find pictures of
Enu
and an American Express credit card, which Jiho mistakenly thinks is a VIP card for a coffee shop. He then sees a 10 million won check in the wallet. Scared, he realizes he's landed himself in big trouble.
He then resolves to go and return the wallet to Jay, say he's just found it, and apologize, but decides to go and sneakily return it to Jay instead so Jay wouldn't know.
Jiho first tries to stick it in Jay's left pant pocket while walking past Jay. However, when he sneaks up to Jay, Jay sees three bees and hits them out of the air because Jay's scared of bugs. Jiho, after witnessing Jay's reflexes, decides to try another plan instead.
He then tries to put it in Jay's backpack after school is out. However, no matter how hard Jiho pulled on it, it wouldn't open. When Jay comes along, Jiho realizes it has a fingerprint lock.
Jiho then tries to catch Jay when he's leaving school, apologize, and return the wallet to him, only to have Jay rush away on a motorcycle.
As Jiho walks back home, he resignedly wonders how he can contact Jay again because he doesn't know Jay's phone number. After all, it's 10 million won. Then, Jiho realizes that all he has to do is put the wallet in Jay's desk. However, just as he realizes it, a trio of bullies come and forces him to exchange backpacks. Jiho belatedly realizes that Jay's wallet, containing the 10 million won, was still in the backpack they had stolen.
Episode 111
Jiho rushes to the convenience store where original Daniel works, and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that, although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow. Daniel then returns to the bullies with his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him. New Daniel then takes Jiho to Jay's home. They then see
Joy,
Jay's younger sister. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she's come over to play. Joy then tells them Jay's just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. Jay's answer is very frenzied, and Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and says it's not like her brother to do so. She then tells them Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel immediately begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl. He decides that it would be fine if he just threw the wallet inside of Jay's bedroom.
However, when Jiho opened the door, he saw Enu's pups inside, barking at him and telling him to leave because they thought he was a thief. They jump at him, biting him. Jiho flings them to the ground and throws the wallet at them, only to infuriate Enu for bullying her children. Enu starts to attack him.
Meanwhile, Joy greets Jay as he gets home. He's sweaty from running, panting and holding a plastic bag. She tells him she's come over to play and asks where he's been. Daniel explains that Jiho's come as well, and that, if Daniel had known earlier, he would have told Jay he was coming beforehand. Jay, seeing Daniel, immediately starts cleaning the room, while Joy tells him it's already clean. Jiho walks out, clutching at his arm and limping, his clothes ripped. Enu barks from behind, saying that she'd caught a thief. That's when Jiho sees the bag Jay is holding, which is full of 10 million won checks. Daniel says that he didn't know Jay had gone out collecting the checks, and that Daniel had a lot of them too. It turns out that the checks were just pamphlets promoting the online clothes shop that Daniel poses for, and Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho realizes that all his work was for nothing and faints.
Cookie 1
The day before, Jay was walking through the streets when he receives a pamphlet for the clothing store that Daniel works for. People were throwing them away when they realized they weren't checks. When Jay puts Daniel's picture in his wallet, he smiles.
Cookie 2
Vasco & Daniel are seen running in the park, after a while they take a break and Vasco comments on how strong willed Daniel is to lose weight, but questions why he's not losing any weight after 3 months.

Synopsis
Episode 19
This arc starts with Namsoo, a boy who is middle class. Namsoo is obsessed with wealth, and tries to impress the rich kids in the fashion department. He is jealous of
Daniel
until he learns that Daniel is not very fashionable. Namsoo decides to prove Daniel is poor, and that's why his clothing is poor.
The
Burn Knuckles
ask
Jace
what to do about
Vasco's
defeat. He tells them to wait and they grow impatient with him.
Jay
overhears the rumors that Daniel is poor and grows concerned.
Episode 20
The next day Jay is surprised to see Daniel greet him, but Daniel thinks Jay is a good person for trying to stop his fight with
Zack
. He overhears Daniel talking about his birthday tomorrow. The Burn Knuckles and the class rich kids make plans to humiliate Daniel.
As Daniel is walking home he runs into Jay, who gives him clothing for his birthday. Daniel is surprised Jay remembered and only accepts the gift when he tells him he doesn't need the clothes. In another alleyway, the Burn Knuckles lay defeated by Jay, and they wonder who he really is.
Namsoo and the rich kids are waiting to expose Daniel when he walks in wearing Jay's expensive clothing. The other kids remark about his old wallet and he mentions it is from his mother. Namsoo is shocked to see Daniel can carry unfashionable items and not care about it. Daniel tries to greet Jay but he doesn't respond, so he keeps moving. Jay smiles shyly to himself in his seat.
Jay has a flashback to the night before he gave the clothes to Daniel. He struggled to write a letter to him asking to be his friend. In the end, he decided against the letter and simply wrote "Happy Bday".

Jay Hong
(홍재열 Hong Jae Yeol)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He is a student in the fashion department at
Jae Won High School
.
Dino Lee plays Jay in the Lookism Chinese drama.
Appearance
Jay is somewhat taller than average, muscular, and has a fair complexion. His dyed long blonde bangs cover his eyes in all circumstances even when he faces strong wind, when he's turned upside down, to the point they never were shown since the beginning of the series. He is always dressed fashionably in high-end brand clothing and wears a variety of Chrome Heart rings on his fingers. He rides a motorcycle to school and carries a custom finger-print bag with him that contains a gun.
Personality
Jay is an extremely quiet person who is shown to never speak, making it impossible for other characters, except his relatives and (Big & Little) Daniel Park and Vasco, to understand him.  He is shown to be a strong fighter trained in Systema and Kali Arnis although he doesn't engage in fights without reason.
He is very notably drawn towards Daniel, to the point where his whole world rotates around his presence: Daniel is the only person that makes Jay exit his bubble to the point that almost all the interactions Jay has are with Daniel. He is shown to be morose whenever Daniel disappears in the story and is ready to help Daniel at any time with whatever he would need, ask, etc.
He is very generous, kind and observant, to Daniel particularly, as well as some other people.
History
Although not many elements of Jay's history were revealed, he is the son of billionaire
Steve Hong
, which makes him the younger brother of
Kitae Hong
and the older brother of
Joy Hong
. However, his relationship with his family isn't great: throughout the series, he is shown to be kept away from family events, being asked by his father to never call him again (after Steve Hong became aware that Jay was involved in a street fight), etc. The only family member he seems to have a good relationship with is Joy, who is often shown hanging out with him.
We also know that until Daniel's arrival at J High School, Jay was a very isolated student who never interacted with anybody norseemed interested in doing so. Since then, Jay opened up a lot, mostly to Daniel, whom he seemsto love more than anybody else, but also to a few other persons (
Vasco
,
Zack Lee
, etc).
In the more recent chapters, hoping to find
Daniel
(whose second body was kidnapped by Workers), Jay went back to
Sophia
, his father's bodyguard, to complete his training, which he dropped out of priorly due to the harshness of the training. He then joined the
Allied
crew, for the same reason.
Fighting Prowess
While having not actively participated in a breadth of fights, Jay has proven to be a very proficient and deadly martial artist. Jay is versed in 2 different martial arts: Systema and Arnis. Systema is a Russian martial art taught by and to special forces for the express purpose of killing or disabling enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible. In fact, Jay often has to put a motorcycle helmet on his opponents to make sure he can't kill them. Arnis is a Filipino martial art with a great emphasis on using weapons such as tonfas, staves, and karambits, along with a supplementary education in unarmed combat. With this martial art, Jay often demonstrates his skills utilizing BB guns
[

]
but has also attacked utilizing burning steel pipes, showing an ability to work with ad-hoc and makeshift weapons. Using these two martial arts in combination, he was able to overwhelm Scott Kwon, Dominic Min, and Jihan Kwak, more recently and after completing his training with Sophia Alexander.
Aside from that, Jay has demonstrated a strong tenacity and physicality. This is exhibited with him having endured burning his own hands to fight utilizing steel pipes and struggling against Logan Lee's submissions despite Logan's physical strength and endurance. He has shown himself to be very quick when it comes to hand speed, striking an uncountable number of times when having taken hold of his opponent,with James Gong noting that in in flurry that Jay could have "killed him 7 times" and being fast enough to counter Logan's natural durability, causing him actually to feel pain through his layer of fat.
Trivia
Jay is modeled after Aboki model Hong Jay.
He has a fear of bugs.
[
4
]
He also had a fear of dogs
[
5
]
, but he overcame it.
[
6
]
When he takes a picture, he usually makes a scared expression.
[
7
]
[
8
]
The penname of his Paprika TV account is 'asdf'. In Chapter 29, he used his account to compete with Lala on who could give the most balloons to the stream of Duke and Daniel.
Jay dreams to be a doctor because of Daniel (who was hospitalized at some point in the series).
[
9
]
Jay used to smoke but quit in Ep. 38 when a passing student told him that he won't get a lover if he does.
He is academically strong and was the #1 student in his class until Daniel Park surpassed him during the midterms arc. He is shown to have a stack of study textbooks and papers on his desk while everyone else in his class messed around.

Kitae is Jay's older brother. Their relationship isn't exactly clear, but they seem to be on neutral terms, as Kitae refers to him as "dude" and talks to him casually.
Steve Hong
The H Group Chairman is Jay's father. They seem to have a strained relationship with each other. The chairman does not approve of Jay getting into trouble, which is why he hired a butler to help keep him from getting into fights and bad situations. During the "Runaway Fam" arc, they meet up and the chairman tells Jay to never call him again.
J High School
Daniel Park
New Body
Jay is considered to be the closest with Daniel's new body. During the earlier episodes, he gave Daniel a bag of new clothes when he saw the Daniel didn't have a lot. He also took it upon himself to raise the puppies Daniel had despite being afraid of dogs. Later in the series, Jay's deep care for Daniel is being shown at almost all of Jay's appearances on the webtoon. He will, for example, when Daniel's new body was in a coma, spend so much time in the hospital by his side to try and help him awakening, than a nurse will say to Daniel, when he does awaken, that Jay "basically lived there" during the three weeks of his coma, studying medecine in hope to find way to help him.
More recently, he even went as far as to join the crew that Daniel Park created with his original body (even though Jay doesn't like to fight at all), in hopes to find Daniel's 2nd body that's missing since he was kidnapped by the Workers. He was stated to have been appearing "down" ever since the Daniel he knows (2nd body) disappeared.
Jay gifts Daniel on his birthday.
Old Body
Jay has a good relationship with Daniel's old body. He went out of his way to fight
Logan Lee
for getting Daniel's "lucky charm" or the 5000 won bill back. When Daniel and his mother goes to the department store to return the dress Daniel bought as a gift for his mother as it had a stain, they refused to change it. But when they saw that Daniel was a friend of Jay, they immediately changed it.
In the newer chapters, he joined Daniel's original body crew,
Allied
, and was shown interacting with Daniel's first body, as well as helping him with some personal business outside the framework of the crew.

Daniel's mother
Jay has a good relationship with her. When he learnt that Daniel's mother made her living by selling garbage boxes, he went out of his way to order the manager of a hotel or a branch to deliver a heap of garbage boxes to their house so that Daniel's mother could sell them all.

Overview
Synopsis
Relationships
Image Gallery
Background
Jay comes from a very rich family, as shown by his expensive clothing.
He is tremendously wealthy, considering he gives a lot of his high-quality clothing and accessories to Daniel, as well as the size of his giant penthouse apartment. He is also very well respected by his butler and others. Jay is the second son of the H Group Conglomerate and the younger brother of
Kitae Hong
, who is the heir to the family's company. Jay seems to have a high position in the company.
Jay is shown to care deeply for Daniel, not hesitating to spend lots of money on him to support, and helps to protect him whenever he's in danger. It is strongly implied that he has feelings for Daniel, though this is not confirmed.
He is implied to have a strained relationship with his parents. His father criticizes Jay for getting into a fist fight and tells him to "don't ever call me again". He seems to have a good relationship with his sister, Joy. There haven't been many scenes with Jay and Kitae to determine the quality of their relationship. In the one scene both are in together, Kitae disapproves of Jay going to a "crappy" Jae Won High School and "dragging" Joy there.
Exposition
Chapter 4
He was first introduced in chapter 4, seemingly intrigued by Daniel's transfer.
Chapter 6
Jay listens in when two girls and Zoe were flirting with Daniel.
When
Zack
's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jay, Zack's friends,
Mira Kim
, and Zoe look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.
As Zack and Daniel were about to fight, Jay showed concern towards Daniel up to the point of attempting to prevent Zack's punch from hitting Daniel. However, as the fight continued, Jay showed slight amazement at Daniels skills. Later, he is in the bathroom listening as three of Zack's underlings were discussing on how to ambush Daniel. He is then seen leaving the bathroom with slightly bloodied clothing leaving the three underlings injured behind him.
Jay Arc
Daniel greeted Jay gratefully recalling his efforts on stopping the fight, but midway received a call from
his mother
about his upcoming birthday. As this was happening, three of his classmates were talking about the possibility of Daniel being a beggar. On Daniel's birthday, Jay gave him a lot of expensive branded clothes. The next day, the same three classmates discussing about Daniel being a poor beggar were threatening to out him to the girls. However, when he arrived in the expensive clothing and as his classmates were complimenting him, Jay was seen with a smile on his face. At the end of the arc, it was revealed that Jay had tried to write a note to Daniel, wishing him a happy birthday and asking to be friends but had eventually just settled for a small tag with 'Happy Bday' written on it, which he gave Daniel along with the bags of clothing.
Festival Arc
(Chapter 25)
During the slave auction, Jay was at the stand attempting to pay $10,000 in order to help Daniel out and save him from a date with Lala Kim. However, he was denied since men were not allowed to buy in the auction.
Paprika TV Arc
(Chapter 29)
Jay was shown at the end with a small grin on his face after he won against Lala Kim for donations to Daniel and Duk Hwa when they appeared in a paprika liveshow.
Second Hand Rana Arc
When Nam Soo tells Zack that a group of con artists had stolen the money Zack had given him, Zack decides to pretend to be a buyer in order to confront the con artists. When Daniel goes to help Zack as well, Jay is seen listening in on them.
When Zack, Daniel, and
Euntae
were fighting the con artists, the con artists, fighting a losing battle, were waiting for backup from a group of freshmen.
Jay had passed by the freshman on his motorcycle and had incapacitated them in an alleyway. When two guys who used to be bothered by said freshmen showed up, they complimented Jay and told him not to smoke because, if he didn't, he would be able to get a lover. They told him that after they had quit smoking, both of them met someone. Jay immediately drops his cigarette (once again implying an attraction to Daniel).
Autumn Boot Camp
When getting on the bus, Daniel believes he would have to sit in the front next to the teacher. However, classmates wave at him, telling him to sit with them in the back. Jay is shown to take the seat next to the teacher instead.
Pavlov's Dog
When
Logan Lee
steals original Daniel's money, including the 5000 won bill Daniel's mother had given new Daniel, new Daniel explains to Jay that old Daniel was a special friend of his, so he had to get the money back. New Daniel introduces Jay to his mother as the friend of the fat Daniel. When Jay meets old Daniel for the first time, Jay acts kindly towards him and gives him a stick of gum (Jay had started chewing gum to stop smoking).
Old Daniel tells Jay that New Daniel had gotten the 5000 won bill from Daniel's mother, which she had earned by selling boxes. He also told him that new Daniel thought of the note as a lucky charm. Jay, remembering the generosity of Daniel's mother and the way new Daniel valued old Daniel, becomes determined to get the money back.
Jay then goes to see a manager of a branch (of either a hotel or a company). The manager is respectful towards Jay and says he hopes Jay will remember him kindly. Jay had asked the manager to look into Logan, and the manager explains that Logan is a notorious bully who is the same age as Jay. He also tells Jay that Logan is a Jujitsu black belt.
The next day, Daniel's mother receives heaps of cardboard boxes from a nearby hotel, and Jay goes to confront Logan about the money. Logan, laughing asks why everyone was asking him about money that day and if Jay was trying to mug him. He asks who sent Jay to collect the money, and Jay only took off his jacket in response.
Later, Jay is seen dealing consecutive kicks and punches to Logan. Logan realizes that Jujitsu doesn't seem to work on the style of fighting Jay is using, Systema, because Jay is fighting from further away. In order to force Jay closer, Logan takes out the envelope of money he had stolen from Daniel and threatens to rip it. Jay runs to save the envelope, only to be grabbed by the hair. Logan then begins to choke Jay using Popsicle.
As Jay runs out of oxygen and starts to go limp, Daniel in his new body runs to help Jay. When Logan tries to grab at Daniel, Daniel swipes the arm aside, running to Jay's side. Logan then realizes Daniel's strength as Jay had barely been able to dodge Logan's attacks earlier. Daniel had been resolved to fight Logan, but in front of Logan, this resolution wavered because of his fear. He began to make excuses such as fighting would dirty the clothes Jay had given him, and that he had to take care of the unconscious Jay. When Logan, frightened by Daniel, tells Daniel to leave, Daniel is relieved he doesn't have to fight, telling himself that maybe Logan's already spent the 5000 won.
When Jay gains consciousness again, he is alarmed and flustered to find himself being carried on Daniel's back. When Daniel tries to comfort him, telling him to calm down and that it's fine if they didn't get the money back because Logan's a famous gangster, Jay hands Daniel the envelope of money he had brought to give to his mother as well as the 5000 won bill.
Daniel feels ashamed that Jay had gotten the money back instead of him and starts crying. Jay, thinking that Daniel had started to cry because Jay was heavy and Daniel wasn't able to carry him anymore, gets off his back and offers Daniel a piggyback ride.
Later, when Daniel in his original body goes to exchange the dress that he had bought for his mother for a different size, the sales clerk tells them they can't exchange it because the dress had a stain. Daniel explains that the stain had been there when he bought it and that another lady was able to exchange her dress for another size even though her dress had a stain too. The sales clerk says that the other lady doesn't seem like a liar whereas Daniel and his mother, who both look poor, are probably trying to cheat them. Daniel's mother says that it's fine and that the dress was too good to wear anyways. The sales clerks laugh and say that it's for the best, and that they had probably been the ones to stain the dress.
Suddenly, Jay walks in and the manager asks the sales clerks the reason they're making a fuss. The manager apologizes to Jay and tells him it's not a big deal. Daniel then starts talking to Jay, who's worried about new Daniel's back. Daniel then asks why he's there, to which Jay may have responded that he was employed there. Daniel then assumes that Jay had worked there part-time when it is probably more likely that he owns the store. The other employees look shocked that Jay seems to know Daniel and immediately exchanged the dress for Daniel. Jay smiled as he walked away when Daniel thanked him. The manager and the sales clerks then apologize profusely to Daniel, offering them VIP status and hoping they would put in a good word for them with Jay.
Lee Euntae Arc
When Euntae offers new Daniel a box of chocolate milk, Jay silently observes, and, a while later, offers Daniel two boxes of chocolate milk.
Jay's Wallet
Jay rushes over to Daniel to help him with a question at school, accidentally dropping his wallet in the process. Jiho pockets it, trying to prank Jay.
Later, Daniel tags along when Jiho asks Jay to buy him some snacks in the hopes that Jay will notice the absence of his wallet. However, Jiho is disappointed to see Jay pay with his cell phone instead.
While in the bathroom, Jiho discovers a check for 10 million won in Jay's wallet and is immediately overcome with guilt for taking it. He resolves to return the wallet to Jay quickly and stealthily, but fails each time as he is ultimately too afraid of embarrassing himself by being noticed.
However, Jiho's backpack (with the wallet inside) is later stolen by a group of bullies, causing him to enter a state of panic. He runs to the convenience store where Daniel's original body is currently working and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow.
Daniel then returns to the bullies after changing into his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him.
After that, New Daniel takes Jiho to Jay's home. Joy, Jay's younger sister, opens the door for them. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she comes over on occasion. Joy tells them that Jay has just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. She mentions to Jay that Daniel is at the apartment, and his response is lightning-quick and very alarmed. Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and comments that it's not like her brother to do so. She discloses to Daniel and Jiho that Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him in his tracks, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl.
In order to subtly return the wallet, Jiho tries to throw the wallet inside of Jay's room but is hindered by Inu and her puppies, who are protective.
Jay comes home, sweaty from having run the entire way and holding a large bag. Upon seeing Daniel, he throws himself into a frenzy trying to clean every surface of the already pristine apartment. Jiho walks out of Jay's room after having successfully thrown the wallet inside (at the cost of being attacked by Inu and her pups) to see Jay, and notices that the bag he's carrying is full of stacks of 10 million won checks identical to the one inside the wallet.
Daniel says that he has a lot of those checks, too. It turns out that rather than being actual checks, those slips of paper are just promotional flyers for the online shop for which Daniel models. Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho, realizing that all his effort was for nothing, promptly faints.
The arc ends with a cut to the previous day. Jay is offered a promotional flyer for the store for which Daniel works. People were throwing them away when they realized the papers weren't checks. Jay, however, turns his over to see Daniel's face printed on the back and smiles to himself as he slips it into his wallet.
The Stalker
When Daniel tells his classmates that he had a stalker, the news appears to worry Jay. He then presses a box cutter into Daniel's hands. Daniel looks surprised and wonders if he had lent it to him before. Jay also walks off with an obvious blush after giving Daniel the box cutter.
Later, when the stalker kidnaps Daniel and Crystal, Crystal is able to cut herself free from the restraints tying her up when Daniel slips the box cutter that Jay gave him into her hands.
Troubled Transfer
He sees Daniel shivering and gives him a concerned look. He glances at Logan Lee, which is the cause of Daniel's shivering.
Picnic
Jay is with Daniel, Zoe, Mira, Zack, and Joy at the school picnic. Zack tells Daniel that he's dead if they can't get a ride since he's late, and Jay sweatdrops. The group decides to ride Altan first, which Mira says is scary. Everyone ends up wearing something on their heads, and Jay and Daniel both wear cat ears and they are happy, while Zack wears Minnie Mouse ears, which he is embarrassed for.
On a ride called Disco Pow Pow that spins very quickly, Joy decides to throw herself at Daniel. Daniel and Jay are sitting next to each other, and Jay stares in horror. He ends up catching her by the face before Daniel can save her. Joy smiles and thanks her brother, but she is secretly frustrated inside. She tries again several times, but Jay caught her every time.

They play the Strength Test, and Jay is not impressed when Zack scores an 85. The group splits up after Daniel leaves with Crystal as an excuse to brush off Soomi. Joy smacks Jay and says that they'd go to Magic Island together.
[

]
People around the two gossip and ask if the two were a rich couple. Joy wants to go somewhere that Jay doesn't so they agree that Jay will wait for Joy. Jay sits down somewhere and looks at the back of his phone. There's a sticker of Daniel wrapping one arm around Jay's shoulder on it. Jay smiles at it.
He sees the Drop Tower from the corner of his eye and imagines Daniel congratulating him on being brave for riding it. When he gets on the ride, he sees someone taking a selfie and chooses to also take a picture. However, it is unexpected when the ride starts, and Jay drops his phone and his wallet.
After the ride, he frantically looks for his lost items. Seonong mistakes him for a beggar and makes fun of him.
[

Seonong finds a pair of shoes and steals them, and they happen to be Jay's. He doesn't realize the shoes are Jay's and throws his old pair of shoes at him. Soomi and her friends see him, and he is wearing the old pair of shoes. Soomi thinks the shoes look vintage unlike the guys at school, which is ironic. He offers he a tissue for her bloody nose that she got while getting beat up by Crystal. She blushes wonders if he's flirting with her (he isn't).
[

]
With the help of people, he finally finds his phone and wallet, but they are damaged. Despite that, Jay is still incredibly happy and hugs his possessions.
Soomi is flirting with the churro stand guy, but she can't stop thinking of Jay. She wills herself to stop thinking of him however, because she thinks he is poor. A chairman passes by, and they acknowledge Jay as his brother, and Soomi finds in shock that he was actually rich.
The chairman playfully tells Jay that he should have been lying quietly, yet he dragged his sister to the school. Joy protests by saying she actually liked the school.
The chairman, otherwise known as Kitae introduces Crystal and Jay. They bow respectfully to each other. Soomi and the churro stand guy glare at them jealously.
[

]
The group reunites to eat. Daniel tells Jay that he couldn't contact him, and Jay nods when Daniel asks if he broke it on the Gyro Drop. They take a third group picture at the Ferris wheel, and Jay's face is facing the camera from the side. From afar, Soomi studies Jay curiously.

Seonong Goes to School
When Seonong goes to Seoul to return the money that Vasco gave him, he gets chased by the Burn Knuckles in a misunderstanding. The Burn Knuckles mistakenly think that he's kidnapped a child and go after him. Jay hears about it and he chases after Seonong with them.
[

Crystal's Investigation
Jay sees Daniel and Crystal at the department store buying clothing. People around them mistake Daniel and Crystal for a couple and Jay looks away.
[

]
When Jay is swimming laps, he thinks back to Daniel and Crystal in the store and starts to swim faster. In class the next day, Daniel says that he felt bad for always taking Jay's things, so he bought some new clothing for Jay. Daniel says that he thought of Jay at the department store and Jay blushes.
At home, Jay tries on the clothing. His butler sweatdrops at the mismatched clothing, but Jay is happy to walk his dogs in what Daniel gave him.

Fake Bank Account
Kouji says that he was willing to help Jiho and his friends recover the bank account because they were the monkeys that Jay kept as pets.

Daniel Park's Death
Daniel thinks of the moments he had spent with his friends when he sees his second body getting driven away by the ambulance. The moments he remembers of Jay are studying together before the finals in freshman year, talking to Jay in a one-sided conversation, and carrying Jay on his back.
[
11
]
Homeless
Daniel finally wakes up in his second body and checks his phone. On Instagram, there's a picture of Jay with the dogs. On Vasco's Instagram, Jay, Mira, Zack, and Zoe are sitting around a cake. The board in the background has "We miss you, Daniel~ T_T come back to us" written on it.

I'm your sword, Jake. A sword that never breaks.
"
—Jerry Kwon  in
episode
333
Jerry Kwon (권지태 Kwon Ji Tae)
a member of
Big Deal
, and second-in-command to
Jake Kim
.
Appearance
Jerry Kwon is a extremely tall and muscular young man that looks like a middle-aged man with sunken black eyes and a bald head, he wears a white polo shirt, a pair of black pants and black shoes, he also spots a black letter H-shaped tattoo in his left arm and a grid-shaped scar across its face.
As a child, Jerry used to wear a white shirt with a navy blue tie under a brown sweater.
Personality
Jerry's main character trait is his undying loyalty to Jake. Jerry sees Jake as a brother, becoming known as Jake's sword for this reason. In the Eli Jang arc, he is shown to be honest, honoring Warren's desire to leave the rest of Hostel alone. Other members of Big Deal respect Jerry greatly for his character, but Jake seems to have changed his mind about Jerry at the end of the Juvenile Detention arc, deeming him "too simple".
Fighting Prowess
Jerry's fighting style is to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength. Described as Jake's mighty sword, Jerry's sheer size and strength is so immense that he was able to shrug off attacks from multiple members of the Monstar crew without notice. He also has lots of experience in fighting given his battle against numerous crews. Jerry doesn't seem to back off in a fight regardless of how injured he becomes and also doesn't dodge an attack when he can; this is seen as a weakness by Gun. Jerry is also shown to hold back his full strength whenever he is in a fight near Jake.
After his fight with Gun, he decided to never lose another fight again and learned Boxing as a martial art to help.
Also in the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Jerry was shown to have an 'enraged' mode where he stopped holding back entirely and pushed Mandeok Bang extremely far and to push Mandeok to use moves against Jerry that he didn't use against Tom Lee
Quotes

Trivia
In episode 228 his name was mistranslated to Gerard Kwon.
Jerry has been compared to Warren Chae in terms of raw strength.
Eli's cat
Lyon

Fighting Prowess
He is known as a natural grappler, as when he was fighting
Hudson Ahn
he was using his grip to overpower Hudson, he was mentioned to have great grip strength as it even made it difficult for Hudson to fight back, even almost killing him by skewering. He is amazingly durable with great endurance and tolerance to pain as he got punched by Hudson directly in the face with a fist that could make a large crater in a boulder and took the attack smiling and laughing saying that 'this is it', 'this is the Ansan'. But his main style is the Hand-Blades style, his side of his hand is amazingly powerful as it was evenly matched with a full right straight and was even a little bit stronger. He was eventually overpowered by a (belief/Taesoo Mode) Hudson Ahn but it was an extremely close fight.

“
I'll show you the hand that made you so wary.
”
— Jichang Kwak, Episode 438
Jichang Kwak (
곽지창 Gwag Ji Chang
)
was a member of the
1st Generation
. During his peak, he held the title of "King of Seoul" until he was usurped by the
eldest
son of
Gapryong Kim
. He was then banished to the Chungcheong Province where he overthrew the current king of Chungcheong and took over.
He had a major influence over the area, overlooking several non-illegal businesses including a beekeeping and brewing business, until he was once again defeated by
James Lee
, who was on a crusade to defeat and mutilate several of the Kings. However, James Lee returned from Chungcheong without maiming Jichang due to his pity for him. Ultimately, Jichang was in complete despair after two one-sided losses and would largely step down as the King of Chungcheong.
Jichang would take up the job of a police officer under the guidance of
Bakgu Noh
. Despite retiring as the King, he still exerts a lot of influence on the Chungcheong area as his
two
brothers
would take up the job of running his crew. As was tradition with the First Generation Kings, Jichang had a signature move which he trained extensively in: the chops of his hands. The "Hand Blade" technique was mainly used with his right hand while the left one tends to be used for defense.
Appearance
Jichang was a tall and muscular young man with sunken black eyes hidden by round glasses and slicked black hair with a short bang covering the forehead. He used to wear a dark brown tie with white circle patterns with a white polo shirt under a beige business suit with black shoes, as well a flame-shaped scar in his right eye.
In his final moments, he wears a Chungcheong police uniform.
Personality
Jichang was a astute and extrememely intelligent individual who notices what people are feeling even before he talks with him.After hearing that
Daniel Park
was looking
at Jinyoung Park
, he analyzed the situation and concluded that he could potentially be on
Charles Choi's
side coming to clean evidence. He quickly came up with a plan to quietly use his former crew to get rid of him and get rid of the body all without lifting a finger thus protecting his image as a cop. It's also good to note that he does not share the same fighting bloodthirst most other Kings have, he would much rather stand back and only fight when necessary.
When it eventually came to light that
Daniel Park
was only looking for Jinyoung Park before Charles Choi and actively opposed him, Jichang's demeanor changed, becoming a respectable and understanding man who showed devotion to the case against Charles Choi. He holds utmost respect for
Bakgu Noh
, and while he doesn't show it, he cares deeply about his brothers. While he is strict, it's done to eventually shape them into becoming better kings than he was.
Synopsis
Jichang Kwak was the King of Seoul during the 1st Generation, and was likely to have been financially successful, as he presumably owned high-rise property and was willing to compensate
Jaegyeon Na
for his damaged car. Prior to cheonliang arc as per gapryong Kim's disciple jinrang and jichang have met where jichang told him to stop being a dog and become a alpha greatly helping jinrang. Seonji yuk was present
During the
Cheonliang Arc
, Jichang , along with the other Kings, appeared in Cheonliang after receiving a "signal" from
Seongji Yuk
[
1
]
. Upon realising that Seongji had been maimed by
Shinmyung Cheon
, Jichang became incensed and decided to fight the
Ghostly
Brothers
. Although it appeared that he was struggling against them at first, he revealed that he was actually observing them due to their notoriety, but found that they had failed to meet his expectations. Deeming that there was "no need to even come up with a strategy", Jichang easily defeated the Ghostly Brothers
[
2
]
.
Jichang and the other Kings then shifted their attention to James Lee, blaming him for his role in defeating Seongji which led to his brutal fate. As the exhausted and injured James fled, Jichang demonstrated his cerebral prowess by steering him towards Jaegyeon. However, James still managed to escape. Before his departure, Jichang asked James what he and his ally, Charles Choi, were planning, to which James only gave an ominous reply, telling the Kings that he would visit them again soon
[
3
]
.
Later on, Jichang was ousted from the city by Gitae Kim and exiled to Chungcheong-do, where he began to work as a police officer in an official capacity. With his brothers and Bakgu Noh, Jichang quietly lived for years in the countryside. Jichang was "indebted" to Bakgu Noh, and aligned himself with
Jinyeong Park
, committing himself to helping Bakgu in his pursuit for justice
[
4
]
.
At some point, Jichang was visited and defeated in battle by James Lee, who expressed disappointment in the state of the former King of Seoul. Feeling sorry for him, James spared Jichang from having a body part taken away, as was the fate of the other defeated Kings
[
5
]
.
When Daniel Park came to Chungcheong during the
Holidays 2 Arc
, Jichang was alerted when Daniel came to the police station and asked for information about Jinyeong Park. Believing Daniel to be working for Charles Choi, Jichang immediately ordered for Daniel to be dealt with quietly by his subordinates, including his brothers. However, Jichang was eventually confronted by Daniel, who saw through his plan and realised that the unassuming police officer was the King of Chungcheong
[
6
]
.
Initially underestimating Daniel, Jichang said that he wouldn't "even raise a hand against" Daniel. He was soon proven wrong when Daniel landed multiple hits on him, and the two began to fight. Having the upper hand at first, Jichang was overpowered temporarily by Daniel who had entered his "self-loathing mode". As Daniel had brought up James Lee's name, Jichang decided to use his signature hand blades against Daniel, overwhelming Daniel and nearly defeating him, if not for the interference of
his
allies
[
5
]
.
With Daniel copying James Lee's abilities to attack him, Jichang chose to demonstrate his superior strength and speed, and dealt serious blows onto Daniel to the point where he was pushed into his
Ultra Instinct
state. Knowing that there was no longer room for leeway, Jichang went for an extremely strong strike on the charging Daniel. However, before either of their hits could connect, Bakgu Noh stepped in to end the fight, having recognised Daniel as a relative of Jinyeong Park
[
7
]
.
After the skirmish, Jichang apologises to Daniel about having sent his men to attack Daniel and his friends. Jichang reveals that he has been laying low in Chungcheong for years to help out Bakgu, whom he refers to respectfully as "Mr Noh". Before Daniel's departure for Jinyeong's location, Daniel asks for his help in Seoul, recognising Jichang's strength. Both Bakgu and Jichang are impressed by this gesture, although Jichang rejects the offer and promises that once he has settled his matters in Chungcheong, he will lend Daniel his strength.
Soon after Daniel leaves, Jichang discusses with Bakgu their plans to take down Charles Choi, having sent Daniel away to avoid involving him in the conflict. Jichang and Bakgu sends evidence of Charles' involvement in the infamous
Gapryong Kim
murder case to a media outlet later that day, hoping that this would finally bring justice.
That night, however, Charles appears in Chungcheong, revealing that the media outlet in question was actually controlled by him. Having located Bakgu, one of the final obstacles in his way, Charles intends to kill Bakgu, but this attempt on his life is stopped by Jichang's appearance. Aware that both of them would be unable to defeat the legendary fighter, Jichang sends Bakgu away to spread the evidence of Charles' guilt himself, while keeping Charles' attention on him
[
4
]
.
Rejecting offers to become his bodyguard, Jichang and Charles engage in a full-on fight, with Charles recognising the danger that he is in, not only due to Jichang's exceptional strength and speed, but his battle strategies. With Jichang seemingly defeated, Charles approaches Jichang to kill him. Unexpectedly, Jichang draws his revolver on Charles.
Unfortunately, Charles is able to disarm him and gains control of the gun, landing a fatal shot on Jichang's abdomen. When Bakgu returns back to the cabin, Jichang attempts to warn Bakgu of Charles' hidden presence to no avail, leading to Charles shooting and killing Bakgu as well.
After the incident, Charles Choi manipulated the scene and media to hide the truth, framing Bakgu for attempting to steal Jichang's gun and both being killed in the scuffle. Although his brothers were unwilling to believe the story portrayed by the media, the truth of the matter was only revealed to them by Daniel, who had correctly deduced that Charles Choi was behind the double murder.
Jichang's funeral was held in Chungcheong and had a large amount of mourners, many of whom were members of the First Generation, including the Kings. Finding that the circumstances of the case to be suspicious, some of the Kings have begun investigating the issue, while Jichang's brothers, Jibeom and Jihan Kwak have joined forces with Daniel Park to seek revenge on Charles Choi
[
8
]
.
Fighting Prowess
Like the other 1st Generation Kings, Jichang Kwak specially trained a signature move, that being his hand chops which he calls "The Hand Blade". A single Hand Blade has the power to break a safe, the blow itself having a similar Attack Potency to
Taesoo Ma
, making him one of the strongest members of the
1st Generation
in terms of Attack Power and Speed.
In terms of intelligence, Jichang was presented as possessing such an aptitude for strategy that he was able to successfully get a hit against Charles Choi. And was even acknowledged by Gitae Kim during their duel.
In the
past
, Jichang was praised by James Lee to be a extremely intelligent fighter.
Relationships
Charles Choi
Jichang desired the fall of Charles and actively assisted the Pre-Generation Bakgu Noh in carrying out a plan to get revenge on Charles. When Charles discovered their location, Jichang held him off, eventually being able to manipulate the situation so that he would be able to get a shot off on Charles with his gun, a strategy that ultimately failed.
Bakgu Noh
After Jichang's retirement, he became committed to helping Bakgu get his revenge on Charles Choi, even going so far as to attempt to hold Charles off so Bakgu could secure the evidence that served as Charles' weak point. In the end, this attempt failed as Bakgu was lured back to the scene and killed by Charles Choi, Jichang himself dying soon after.
After the pair's deaths, Charles framed Bakgu for being responsible for the incident, the official story being that Bakgu attacked Jichang, who struggled to take the gun from Bakgu, before the gun went off, ending in both being killed.
Trivia
According to
Charles Choi
, one of the things that sets Jichang apart from the other Kings is his superior strength and speed, the second being that he is a tactician.
Jichang used to be the King of Seoul, but he was usurped and exiled to Chungcheong-do by Jake Kim's half-brother. Regarding this fact, James Lee mentions that Jichang was crushed by that man.
When Jichang was exiled to Chungcheong-do, he defeated and drove out the original King of Chungcheong. The existence of this King is only known from a brief mention by
James Lee
in chapter 438 when he says "The original King of Chungcheong did nothing wrong."

Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
He is stronger than his older brother Jibeom Kwak (as he effortlessly defeated him to become his oldest brother Jichang Kwak's successor), who was evenly matched and barely overpowered by Hudson Ahn. He was easily and effortlessly overpowering a post Alexander Sophia training Jay Hong during their fight, but it should also been known that Jay Hong was trying to put a helmet on Jihan's head for his Kali Arnis and only using Systema. While his Hand-Blade style is exceptionally powerful as it almost knocked out Jay Hong, he isn't an idiot and knows that the Hand-Blades can only get him so far, so his true fighting style is a more street like fighting style that involves kicks, punches, knees and elbows. Surprisingly with his scarred up build he has great durability and endurance as he could take every Systema attack used against him by Jay and even overpowered the Systema using Jay Hong and was about to kill him before Jay distracted him and used Kali Arnis. While Jihan did survive the onslaught of attacks used by Jay Hong and could have kept on fighting he accepted his defeat (indicating that he is honorable) and wished his enemy (at that time) luck on the fight ahead.He is still definitely above Jay without weapons as he is shown to overpower Jay in hand to hand combat and is smart enough to take on Hudson and Vin Jin without much difficulty if he uses his battle IQ which ranks him higher. Also keep note that he didn't go all out against Jay which was the same case for Jay but is still debatable.

Synopsis
Episode 370
The police arrive at the convenience store and find Daniel passed out on the ground, and Wally popping bottles of butane. Daniel warns them that Jiho is on the run. Jiho threatens a taxi driver to take him to Gangbuk. Jiho heads to Ansan Public's base and says they still have a chance of winning if they can use Daniel's female friends as hostages. Jacky and Channing blame Jiho for their injuries and refuse to help in the slightest. Jiho wonders who he can go to for help, since Darius is missing. He remembers Jake Kim and decides to go to him. On the way though he runs into some old bullies from J High, and they pee on him.
Jiho comes to Big Deal's base and asks to see Jake. Jake Kim comes out and Jiho starts explaining his plan about taking over Seoul. Jake stops Jiho and tells him to go to the hospital first, since he's not okay. Jiho takes this as Jake abandoning him, and he takes out a knife. He says he'll tell Jake about Daniel's secret if he offers to take him in.
Episode 371
Without hesitating, Jiho tells Jake that Daniel has two bodies. Jake grabs Jiho and yells at him to get it together, and that Jiho should have never left prison without taking care of his condition. He asks Jiho who he met in prison, and Jiho runs away. Worried about him, Jake sends two of his men after Jiho.
Jake talks to Brad and Jason about Jiho. Jason mentions how Jiho got a lighter sentence of two years despite his charge of attempted homicide, and Brad says it's understandable he wouldn't want to be caught. A Big Deal member comes in to tell Jake they've found Jiho, but there's a problem. Daniel Park and the detective run to a building where Jiho is on the roof, talking to someone. At some point, Jiho falls off the roof and Daniel fails to catch him.
At Jiho's funeral his parents weep for him. The detective goes over his medical report and notes that the reason for his early release was a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. The police searched the security cameras after the incident, but they couldn't find a second person. Only Jiho had entered the building. It turns out Jiho had been talking to a younger version of himself, who assured him that he has a plan to win before pushing him off the building. As he falls, Jiho thinks that he isn't a bug.
Eugene is on the phone when someone asks him why he seems happy. He mentions that a friend of his passed recently, but also that the sales of his circus have been rising. He compliments the Workers 2nd affiliate.

, and the former leader of
Backdoor
and the
James Lee Crew
.
Appearance
Jiho was a bespectacled teen, with a bowl cut, a round baby face, and a warm smile. He was fairly short and lacks muscles. He has dark hair and bangs on his forehead. He normally wore expensive brand clothing or his
J High
uniform.
As a result of his imprisonment, Jiho's hair was shaved but grew back to neck-length 6 months later in an unkempt fringe cut. He no longer wore glasses and lost a few of his teeth. Jiho now lacked fullness in his face, with dark bags under his eyes and a binary expression either showing an eerie grin or no emotion on his face whatsoever.
Personality
Jiho was weak-minded and insecure, easily influenced by others, causing him to often submit to peer pressure. This was especially noticeable whenever he went out with bad crowds, as he was always trying and failing to be “cool” to the point of committing crimes (such as illegal betting, underage drinking, and even almost vandalism). When he was sitting with
Duke
and
Daniel
outside of the convenience store, he started smoking to try to look cooler than them, saying that he had smoked many times; despite it actually being his first. He also bought a lot of expensive brands and limited items for the same reason.
He was power-hungry and obsessed with status, proceeding to take many dangerous actions simply to climb up the social hierarchy. He was friends with Daniel and
Zack
just to enhance his perceived image, and never actually reciprocated any of their friendships and gestures. He only went to them whenever he wanted help. He also looked down on people who he considered lower than him and sometimes even provoked them, but would then run to Daniel and his friends for protection.
Jiho had a habit of victimizing himself and has an inferiority complex. He felt distanced from Daniel's group but never tried to genuinely befriend them in the first place. He was also a very desperate person, going to various lengths to get away with his mistakes and hide his wrongdoings. He lied to the detective that he had actually pushed
James Gong
and Daniel Park.
At Juvenile Prison, he got influenced by
another prisoner
and was in solitary for so long that he became a sociopath. He developed a lust for murder and tried to kill a
cellmate
and his main bully at Juvenile Prison. He ended up getting into fights and making more problems, so much so that the authorities continually shifted him from cells.

Fighting Prowess
Jiho Park in J High was almost always one of the weakest kids in class. His scrawny frame and lack of skill meant he was always on the receiving end of a beatdown. However, after getting into prison and creating his new philosophy Jiho developed a "fighting style" similar to
Eli Jang
and
Dominic Min
. He became far more determined and vicious, getting back up after taking hits from Darius Hong and
Brad Lee
in prison and never faltering for even a second. He also used anything he could grab as a weapon, while also using unfair tactics like biting and sneaking up on them to win. After a couple of months, Jiho became so feared in the prison that he had formed a "crew" of his own and used his underlings to act for him out of fear.
Quotes

J High School
Daniel Park
Old Body
He met Daniel's old body at the convenience store where Daniel worked. When Jiho met him the second time, he apologized for the fight and he had bought Duke with him as he didn't want to apologize alone.
The trio talked with each other for a long time and shared their experiences of being bullied. They became good friends and Jiho used to visit him in the store often along with Duk Hwa.
But soon he started visiting Daniel's old body only when he wanted help from him. He also stole some money from the store for illegal betting. Even though he had helped Jiho, in the end, Jiho considered Daniel's old body as having lower status than himself.
New Body
Daniel invited him to eat with him during lunch at school, and they soon became good friends. Through Daniel, Jiho met Zack, Mira, Jay, Joy, and Daniel's other friends. He reciprocated their friendships at first, but it did not continue as he only cared about his own status and took advantage of Daniel's popularity for himself. Daniel tried to invite Jiho to hang out with them constantly, but Jiho still felt left out of the group.
When Daniel restrained James Goh from attacking Jiho, Jiho was enraged as Daniel told him to run away. He twisted Daniel's words. This resulted in him pushing Daniel and James out of the window, thereby committing a crime - attempted murder. Even after putting them into a coma, he wished that they never wake up so that he could get away with the crime.

Background
He is an only child who lives with his parents. He used to be bullied by
Doo Lee
regularly, and he was treated like a slave. After Daniel befriended him, he stopped being bullied.
Exposition
Jiho was summoned by Doo Lee to steal a charger from the convince store. Daniel caught him as he tripped. Doo summoned Daniel and Jiho outside and made them fight each other by saying that the winner wouldn't have to serve him anymore.
Illegal Toto Arc
Jiho meets an old friend John who introduces him to illegal gambling. He also befriends Jake Kim, the boss of Big Deal (but he is unaware of this). Jiho becomes obsessed with gambling and loses all his money. He begs John's friend Jake to lend him some, and Jake's gangster accomplice tells him to take out a loan.
When Jiho gets enough money to pay back the gamblers they cut all contact to him. Jiho becomes desperate and asks Daniel to forgive him for his crimes. Crystal calls Kouji, and they help Jiho get his money back.
Jae Yeol's Wallet
Jiho had just gotten his mom to buy him a new Vibe limited edition backpack, and his friends were fawning over it. However, when Jiho was with Jay and Daniel, the girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Feeling jealous, Jiho decides to steal Jay's wallet and pull a prank on it. He discovers Jay has a lot of money in his wallet and tries to return it, and is met with difficulty. He eventually makes it to Jay's house and returns the wallet.
Fake Bank Account
Jiho is lonely because Daniel's friends leave him out. He befriends James Gong, a former classmate who used to be a problem kid. James is nice to Jiho but a little bit crazy. Regardless, he likes having a friend.
James asks Jiho to give him some money a lot, so he makes him a bank account. James sells this bank account to Jin Jang, who uses it to scam people and make money for the God Dogs. Jiho can't get his account back so he tries to find the scammers. Zack decides to help him, and with his friends they manage to find the bank accounts.
At school, Jiho is a laughingstock for getting into scams. He feels miserable because he can't do anything for himself. He tries to cut James out of revenge but James is stronger than him. Daniel saves Jiho and he tries to get him to calm down but Jiho gets mad at him. He pushes Daniel and James out a window on the fifth floor.

Jiho gets bullied again and attacks Darius in a bathroom. He is placed in solitary confinement and slowly becomes insane. Jiho challenges Darius to a fight again and almost kills him by fighting dirty and fighting to the death. Jake becomes interested in Jiho and he gives him the advice to fight to the death. He later changes his looks to looking more of a teenage murderer.
Juvenile Prison Jiho Park
Jiho is assigned a psychologist to look at his case. He pretends to be a kindhearted boy so the psychologist will grant him release from the prison. The psychologist is at first, impressed with Jiho, for Jiho admits to his crimes while drawing a house with two windows and a windmill on the top. While nobody is watching he does horrific acts to the other inmates in his cell, bullying Riley and trying to push Jason Yoon into a saw, now that he is in charge of most of the prison after his brutal victory against Darius Hong. Jake accepts him into Big Deal and other inmates decide to listen to Jiho out of fear of his personality. Once he is in the clear to leave prison, he attacks the psychologist, for talking about Jiho's past, saying that you cannot just look into somebody's past like that before he slams a metal lunch tray at the side of the psychologist's head, knockin him out down to the ground. Jiho takes the psychologist's fidget spinner before prison guards rush into the lunchroom. The majority of other prisoners stand up to Jiho by saying they were the ones who injured the psychologist. Before Darius Hong was chosen to be released from the prison, he accepts Jiho's order to take care of Hostel before awaiting his command, in which Darius lovely agrees to.

—Jinyeong Park  in
episode
Ep. 470
Jinyeong Park (박진영 Park Jin Young)
is a minor antagonist first appearing in
Workers (1st Affiliate)
.  He's
Daniel Park
uncle. He was also the commander of the strike force of the
Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang
and he was the main rival of
Charles Choi
, who, like Charles, knows about the existence of two bodies and about his weakness.
At the moment, the Jinyeong is in a very bad psychological and spiritual state, because of this, he takes pills that obscure his knowledge about the past, so as not to go crazy from events in the past. He is also responsible for the transformation and mutation of
No. 1
, Jinyeong, saving his life, greatly changed the appearance and physique of Hangyeoul, after which he became the main combat unit and one of the leaders of the
Workers (1st Affiliate)
.
Appearance
Jinyeong is a fairly tall, slender guy with a muscular physique. He has black disheveled hair. He is seen donning a white lab coat over a black turtleneck with navy blue trousers. His appearance when young has been noted to be similar to that of (OG) Daniel Park.
Personality
At this point of the story, he has a bit of a "mad scientist" temperament. He is mentally unstable, and start to act cruelly when someone does something he doesn't like, such as torturing Daniel Park by stabbing him with dozens of needles because he smiled despite being in a very tough situation.
Still, his personality, temperament and self-control worsen even more when he is reminded in some way of things/people from his past. Until it gets to the point where he starts banging his head against the wall until he passes out, or taking his medication to forget certain things again.
Nonetheless, according to Eugene and Tom Lee's comments, it seems like he didn't have that personality pan originally, but rather that it appeared after he went crazy.
Relationships
Gapryong's Fist
Gapryong Kim
As a former colleague and best friend of
Gapryong Kim
, Jinyeong respected and appreciated him very much, during a meeting with
Tom Lee
, Jinyeong immediately attacked him, blaming Tom for the murder, feeling guilt and deep hatred, despair and sadness remembering the past with Gapryong and his murder. There is also a sense of rivalry and parity between them, they also often competed and checked which of them was stronger.
Tom Lee
Jinyeong Park thinks of him as an enemy, because he strongly believes that Tom Lee is responsible for Gapryong Kim's death. Jinyeong went into a fit after seeing Tom Lee, immediately attacking him especially after hearing him say "Elite".
Also, Tom Lee created the White Tiger Job Center with the principal hope of finding Jinyeong Park, meaning business is definitely happening between them.
Charles Choi
As a former colleague of Jinyeong in Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang, their relationship hasn't been clarified yet, but seeing the fact that Park Jinyeong reacts very strongly whenever he hears Charles' nickname (Elite), it seems that something is going on between the two of them.
In the most recent chapters, Jinyeong has been referred to as Charles Choi's biggest weakness, apart from the evidence Bakgu Noh possessed that proved his hand in the cover-up of Gapryong Kim's death.
Bakgu Noh
As a former member of Gapryong's Fist Gang, a member of the pre-generation, and a person who worked as Gapryong Kim's driver, he is familiar with Jinyeong. However, they may have a fairly close relationship, as he refers to Daniel with the Korean honorific "도련님" ("Young Master") as soon as he recognizes his resemblance with Jinyeong.
2nd Generation
Jake Kim
In a flashback, Jake Kim stated that as a child, he remembered visiting the clinic and seeing Jinyeong Park, his uncle. Jinyeong Park treated Jake kindly, and gave him whatever he wanted. In the present, Jinyeong didn't recognize Jake as he went through a traumatic truth alone, and thus went crazy and couldn't remember him. He regained his grip on reality later on and helped Jake Kim and Allied

Daniel Park is Jinyeong's nephew
Synopsis
History
Details about his past are still unknown, but during the
0th Generation
he was the head of activities of the Gapryong Fist, he fought alongside
Gapryong Kim
to defeat a greater power, thus achieving peace.
After that, he entered the field of medicine and pharmaceuticals (for reasons not yet revealed), and at some point, he lost his sanity, probably as a result of discovering something.
At some other point in the
2nd Generation
, Jinyeong joins the
Workers
, both to hide from
Charles Choi
(because he knows his weakness), but also to unite with as many powers as possible to take him down.
Fighting Prowess
His fighting style hasn't been revealed yet, but it has been disclosed that he is among the three persons in the entire verse that possesses the Copying Ability (the other two being Daniel Park and Johan Seong).
Jinyeong Park after a fight, when he was in Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang.
Moreover, although he is probably far from his heyday level of fighting, if we consider his position in Gapryong's Fist Gang, it's clear that he is a strong man with enough fighting power to have the upper hand on a character such as
Tom Lee
, who is recognized in the verse and acknowledged by the author as one of the strongest fighters.
Jinyeong attacking Tom Lee
That aside, he is the only one among the executives of Gapryong's Fist Gang that has not suffered any physical damage (for reference,
Elite
lost his arm, and
Tom Lee
his hand). Instead, he seems to suffer from a severe mental illness that would greatly decrease his combat capability, which could be seen as a worse handicap than Charles Choi's missing arm or Tom Lee's missing hand.
Jinyeong Park's Unknown Brother Theory
It was recently confirmed that Daniel's mother is the eldest of three siblings, for now we know that one of them is Jinyeong Park, while little or nothing is known about the other brother.
In chapter 403, Jinyeong Park says "My brother!" after shouting "Elite!", he then asks to be killed as well. This could mean that Jinyeong Park's brother died or something terrible happened to him because of Charles Choi, it could be the reason why Seonhui Park believes that he died too.
Whatever happened to her with the unknown brother could be the reason why Jinyeong Park lost his sanity.
Quotes
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Your uncle is so sorry...! Your uncle should've protected you... but I was so foolish and lacking...! Uncle should've been the one to protect everything.. your uncle should've protected everyone...! I'm so sorry that I let your dad die..."
"You brat, did you forget what your uncle told you? That I would do anything, for you Jake. That's right. From now on, your uncle will be on your side."

Trivia
He seems to know someone other than
Daniel Park
that also has two bodies, seeing his reaction when he learned that Daniel indeed had two. It makes him the third person (along with
DG
and
Charles
) that knows for sure about Daniel's two bodies.
He is almost certainly the person responsible for the making of the medicine that
Olly Wang
and
Sinu Han
were seen taking.
He's named after Singer Park Jin-young from JYP Entertainment.

Synopsis
Episode 252
Jin Jang
begins spreading rumors in
J high
about who is the best fighter. He learns that
Daniel
is the strongest but that
Zack
is determined to beat him. He believes
Logan
is stronger than
Vasco
but the
Burn Knuckles
protest that nobody is stronger than him. He learns that
Jay
and
Eli
are not fans of fighting and fails to mention Vin or Mary, which triggers Vin.
In the bathroom Jin is preparing what to do with this information when he is approached by
Jace
, who tells him he knows why Jin came. Jin reveals that he is not yet done with his analysis as he has yet to analyze Jay or Eli. He set up an ambush for both of them using the
God Dog
OBs; Eli is stopped by the Park brothers and Jay is stopped by Scott Kwon and Dominic Min.
Episode 253
Jin Jang suspects that Eli will be in trouble because he hasn't fought in a while, and Jay was overprotected as a child. Jace thinks otherwise, believing that Jay and Eli are just hiding their strength. Eli has difficulty fighting the Park brothers because they are trained and he is a streetfighter, and Jay has the opposite problem. Jin reveals that he set up these matches so they would have no chance of winning.
Jace has faith that Eli will win his fight regardless of his weaknesses because Eli has determination and willpower. He will do anything for
Yenna
, and when he realizes he is late to pick her up he goes into savage mode. Jace is also unconcerned for Jay, believing that Jay still has one trick up his sleeve: the contents of his suitcase that nobody knows. With these words Jay pulls out a gun and aims a laser at Dominic's forehead.
Episode 254
Scott and Dominic are frozen in fear, and Jay takes the opportunity to attack them. He defeats them with Kali Arnis, a martial art specific to improvised weaponry. Eli Jang also defeats Hope and Ivan Park using his blunt savagery, racing to the daycare to pick up Yenna. Jace tells Jin he could have never expected it, and Jin counters by saying Jace couldn't expect Jin escaping from a window.
Jace cringes at his escape and decides he overestimated Jin, but Jin tells Olly that Jace is too prideful. He came to J high not to analyze the fighters, but to analyze Jace's analytical skills. He tells Olly he has a three step plan to destroy J high, and his first step will target Jace.
Cookie
At her house
Joy
asks her father's assistant for a rifle, which he gives her. She asks why he has so many guns when he's not a kid and he asks if she believes they are real. He tells her even he isn't sure whether the guns are real.
Ending
Daniel and his friends decide to go on a trip to visit Jay's seaside villa. He packs his handsome body in a large suitcase and carries it onto the train. He is happy they won't have to fight but
Olly
suspects there will be a fight, so he sends the uncles of Hostel to Cheongliang.
Mary Kim
and
Vin Jin
are back in their hometown Cheongliang when they hear the fashion department kids are headed there. Mary is worried because Vin's old friends are dangerous, and wonders if they will be alright.

Jin Jang
(장진혁
Jang Jin-hyuk
)
is a minor character and an antagonist in Lookism.
Appearance
Jin has dark hair, dark eyes, and thick eyebrows. He has three silver piercings, two above and below his right eyebrow, and one on the right side of his nose.
Personality
Jin Jang is a ruthless individual when he is fighting. He is known to be sadistic in battles and likes to torture his opponents when he is done with them. Despite the way he treats his enemies, he is good leader. The K-House members are loyal towards him and respect his abilities.
Fighting Prowess
Johan said that while he beat Jin, Jin isn't someone to look down on because he can easily detect an opponent's weaknesses. He said that Jin only acts after he's finished an analysis.
[
5
]
In Jin's fight against Vasco, he shows that he can win when he predicts an opponent's moves, yet is weak when not able to analyze beforehand.
[
6
]
Jin Jang also was fully capable of defeating Scott Know with ease once he analyzed his style.
Jin Jang's analysis also proceeds to his strategic planning as he tried to set up Jay and Eli with opponents that would they would be very poor against. Not only did he use this to test their prowess but to also test Jace's intellect. Thus proving that Jin Jang is on the smarter side of the spectrum when it comes to the characters. His analyzation can also be used in a broader sense as during the Hostel arc he was capable of manipulating the J high school group to fight each other without lifting a finger.
Quotes
Trivia
Jin Jang's younger brother Jihyeok Jang is a major character in Questism, another PTJ Comic. Jin makes a cameo appearance in episode 35.

“
Without any power, you can't protect shit.
”
— Johan Seong,
Ep. 242
Johan Seong
(성요한 Seong Yo-Han)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He was a childhood friend of
Mira
and
Zack
, as well as the leader of
God Dog
. He also used to be one of the successors of
Gun Park
. During the reign of the God Dog, he ruled all of Gangbuk, but after the gang's collapse, he refused this position. He also makes an appearance in
Taejun Pak
's another webtoon Questism as a secondary character.
Appearance
Johan has a child-like appearance, a lean and slender physique; when he cross dressed, he was said to have nice hips.
[
3
]
Johan's hair is styled into a brown mullet, with bangs barely covering his eyes. His eye color is black; however, it has been noted after the
God Dog arc
that his left eye has started to turn gray, signifying his growing blindness. which was possibly passed onto from his
mother
.
His attire once consisted of a black hoodie with the God Dog logo on the back, but ever since the disbanding of the group, he is usually seen wearing dark clothing, boots, and a cap. In the past, he wore two wish bracelets, one to wish for his mother's eyesight to get better and the other to wish that he'd be able take care of Mira forever, but gave them both up after the
Cult
and
God Dog
arcs.
He has been referred to as handsome and hot.
Personality
Johan is first introduced as a timid child in love with
Mira
, his friend; similar to his other friend,
Zack Lee
. He was shown to care more for others than for himself, allowing himself to get beaten up by bullies to avoid getting in trouble for the sake of his mother. When he was younger, he was very obedient and cared dearly about his mother and Mira. He was also very faithful to his religion.
During his middle school years, Johan had low self esteem and thought of himself as a loser, ostracizing himself from his only friends, Mira and Zack. He overcame his jealousy by beating Zack in the boxing championship, only to completely disappear from their lives soon after.
After the incident with the cult, Johan turns more reserved and cold. He has a bitter view of the world and believes power is the most important thing. He cannot stand optimistic characters like
Vasco
who have a bright worldview, and he takes defeat to such characters personally. However, it is implied by Vasco that the reason he is so cold is because he is lonely and is afraid to trust in others.
[
3
]
Johan is stubborn, especially when it comes to other gang members. He can be commanding, as demonstrated when he did not hesitate to order around two members of Hostel after he defeated them
[
4
]
. He can also be incredibly childish when jealous of others,
[
3
]
as seen in the 'One Night' arc where he teamed up with
Jace Park
and became evidently jealous of Jace and
Vasco
's close friendship as described by Jace, going out of his way to prove his own worth. His selfishness is cited as a major character flaw by both
Gun
and
Jin Jang
,
[
5
]
the former giving it as the reason why Johan was disqualified as his successor.
Although Johan claims that his only family are his dogs, Eden and Miro, it's implied he still cares about his mother. This is seen when he continued to go back to her hair salon, despite her deteriorating vision meaning he never got a good haircut. Which also  caused her to continually think he was Zack instead. Also the fact that he formed a crew to pay for his mothers cornea transplant.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Copy Technique
Johan is a member of the fearsome Four Major Crews and is the leader of the crew "God Dog". Jace has stated that Johan, unlike the other crews, never needed a right-hand man or extra muscle to back him up.
[
3
]
Johan's true potential was always held back because he did not want to cause trouble for his mom by fighting. However, he finally decided to reach his fighting potential in order to save his mom from being stoned to death during the
Cult arc
.
Much like
Daniel Park
, Johan is another character (the only other one besides these two is
Jinyoung Park
) in the series who has been shown to be able to execute a technique perfectly just by having seen it once. This is shown when Johan mastered Zack's jabs just by seeing it in action once. A few years later he would use that very technique to save his mom's life, by jabbing stones thrown at her before they hit her. However, unlike Daniel, he seems to stick with the first fighting style he learned (boxing from Zack) and has only improved upon it, whereas Daniel switches between various fighting styles to better suit himself in a fight.
Johan uses the same fighting style as Zack - boxing, heavily relying on speed and bursts of power to increase the force of his punches. Johan's talent even surpasses Zack, someone who has trained in boxing since he was young. He is faster than Zack, as stated by many characters, and was the first to beat Daniel in a race (albeit Daniel had run 3 miles prior to their race). He defeated Zack in a boxing match as his punches were too fast for Zack to dodge.
As displayed in his fights against Gun and Eli, he seems to lack the natural build of a fighter. While he looks like he has a weak physicality, he is actually quite strong.
[
4
]
, despite his build seemingly being more suited for speed. Johan can unleash all his energy in a single moment, creating immense burst power and strength enough to forcefully open a locked steel door, as seen in the
Animal Cruelty
arc.
Gun
, a legendary fighter, chooses Johan as a candidate for his successor, but later disqualifies him. However, the only weakness he faced was that his physicality was lacking in comparison to his skill. Gun himself compares Johan to a computer with "software (that) is cutting edge but... hardware from the 90s", stating that in that regard, he is the opposite of Vasco, who possesses poor skill but high physical abilities.
Ever since his defeat at the hands of Gun, Johan has increased his physicality to the point where he could overpower
Seth Lee
in a contest of strength (someone who can bend metal rods with his thumb) while copying
Vasco
. He has also managed to copy
Jake Kim
's MMA flip, which he used on
Goo
.
Despite these advances, Johan's eyes have degraded to some extent as well, whilst this doesn't cause a dramatic reduction in his fighting abilities. This led to him missing an attack on Zack Lee.
In Chapter 421 Johan gains the ability to imitate Daniel by using all of his muscles and nerves for a limit of ten seconds.
In the fight against Yuseong, Johan ended up being able to copy CQC (after a brief exchange with Manager Kim) and made Yuseong pass out with a combo from it (after the fight and wanting to take out Eugene). Also, the fact that Johan was having such an effect on Yuseong pshycology, Eugene was wondering if Johan was powerful beyond measure and that he might be stronger than Tom Lee .
Johan's Infinite Technique
The Infinite Technique
This technique was the amalgamation of all the techniques Johan copied before his fight with Gun. The Technique is totally unpredictable and fluid as it was catching Gun Park off-guard. On getting inspiration from Tom Lee before
"Hunt for Gun"
Johan's fighting style improved a lot he fought on almost equal footing with an injured Gun using his
Copy
, who was still hard to be defeated, with his temporarily improved vision he almost sent Gun to his death point. Gun noticed that Johan merged his countless copied techniques into a single fighting style which caught even Gun Park off-guard. Gun reached the conclusion that Johan has finally found his own path and named this fighting style the
Infinite technique.
Quotes
"Spare me the bullshit. Friends? I've cut myself off from everyone. Even from my family, because I knew they were all useless. Without any power, you can't protect shit. Look.. look at what having no power gets you."

Without any power, you can't protect shit.

Trivia
His name in English strictly translates to "St. John", which is notably a character in
Jane Eyre
.
He is the only one of his friends to have asked for two wish bracelets, both of which are broken, but neither of which came true.
Johan has a soft spot for animals, and is often seen with his dogs Miro and Eden.
Despite stating that that he hated dogfights, Johan was seen using a human shield, and dirty boxing during the One Night arc.
After God Dog arc, his left eye consistently becomes drawn as gray. This is later revealed to be the fact that Johan is going blind, much like his mother.
Johan is implied to have learnt Taekwondo from
Seong Taehoon
, a character of Viral Hit, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.
[
8
]
Johan's distant relative
Haru Seong
used to cut their hair at his mothers shop but stopped cutting their hair as his mother is now blind, Haru Seong is a character from
Questism
, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.
Johan was requested to aid and did aid
Suhyeon Kim
, the protagonist of
Questism
, because he was indebted to
Haru Seong
in some way. This significantly impacted the story of Questism.

J High School
Mira Kim
As a child, and during his teens, he used to be in love with Mira and seemed to care a lot for her. One of his wishes was for him to always protect her. They were good friends and went to church together along with Zack. They also attended the same middle school together. Later, he distances himself from her to keep her from knowing what happened to his mother.
Zack Lee
Zack beats up Johan's bullies
He and Zack were friends as a child. Sometimes Zack would visit his mother, along with him and Mira to get a haircut. He is shown to be in good terms with him and gave Johan a candy which he didn't like.
Johan used to be jealous about Zack's strength. Zack used to protect Johan from bullies by beating them up. Johan used to be embarrassed by it, especially if Mira had witnessed it. He slowly tried to edge away from Zack to keep away from knowing what happened to his mother.
During the middle school boxing championship, he was Zack's last opponent and surprisingly defeated him and won the championship. He humiliated him in front of Mira on purpose, souring their relationship and causing Zack to quit boxing. Despite this Zack still considers Johan a friend, and saves him from Gun at the end of the God Dog arc.
Daniel Park
Johan met Daniel Park (in his new body) when both were jogging with each of their dogs. They start talking and decide to race against each other. Surprisingly, Johan won but just barely. This was probably because Daniel had already ran 3 miles prior to their race.
When their dogs went missing, both went to the bottom of it to recover their missing pets (as well as several other people's). Johan considers him as a friend and even asks Daniel to join the God Dogs. However, when Daniel rejects his offer he changes his mind about him.

Jace Park
During the One Night Arc, Johan and Jace form an uneasy alliance. Jace shows much kindness to Johan during this period while also massively respecting his great strength and prestige. During the duration of this deal, the duo mostly was willing to work with each other despite a couple of difficulties in Jace's eccentric planning and Johan's impatience. Jace described Johan as a ticking time bomb that was hard to keep under control.

Nevertheless, they end the deal on equal terms but still not exactly friends.

Jong Gun
Gun first meets Johan in an alley to ask see if he would be a likely candidate for being his successor. He had heard about Johan's reputation - someone who works in the day and robs street thugs at night - before meeting him. Johan yearns to be Gun's successor so he can be high enough in position to move his mother up the waiting list for her eye surgery. After being abandoned by Gun, Johan became determined to beat him and take his position by force.

Background
Johan grew up with his mother in a poor neighborhood; his father is never seen, though he was told by his mother he's in the US, it's later revealed his mother is a widow. He knew Zack and Mira because they all attended the same church, and he had faith in God until his life went downhill.
Johan's mother supported Johan by working as a hair stylist in her own hair salon, but she lost many customers due to her growing blindness. She told Johan to behave in school because life was getting more difficult for them, and Johan grew resentful of how the other kids could act out of line without consequences while he had to worry about his behavior because of his mother.
Johan was often bullied at his junior high school
[
1
]
, with Zack often stepping in to defend him. Just like Zack, he had a crush on Mira.
[
1
]
However, he gave up on her after the Cult arc.
After he saved his mother from the cult, he disappeared to collect money for a cornea transplant to restore his mother's sight. Johan became infamous for stealing the shoes of people he fought (presumably selling them afterwards for money), an idea given in passing by
Samuel Seo
during his time at Big
Deal
. Even after he collected all the money, his mother couldn't get the treatment because she was on a long waiting list. When Johan hears that Gun can save his mother, he trains under Gun to become his successor and is given the task of uniting the four crews.
Johan created his crew,
God Dog
, after dropping out of middle school. He took over
Jin Jang
's old gang and conquered many other gangs in Gangbuk. He wanted to take over Gangdong, but lost in a fight to
Hostel
's
Eli Jang
. As a result, he was forced to give up the region to Hostel.
Johan used his raw talent to further his crew's money making ability, but after repeated involvement with the members of J High School, his defeat to Gun and betrayal of Jin Jang he became the only God Dog; however, Johan and many other stated that he was the only God Dog from the start. The majority of God Dog was absorbed by
Big Deal
, leaving Johan to continue collecting money for his mother's treatment on his own. He really wants to come back home. But he is afraid that his mother will collapsed if she finds out that he has the same disease as hers.
Animal Cruelty
Johan first appears in present time exercising with Eden. When Eden gets into a fight with Enu, he meets Daniel and the two begin chatting with each other. Johan hears Daniel talking down about his gang, so he initially decides to beat him. After witnessing Daniel's incredible stamina and strength, he decides against it.
When the two of them get their dogs stolen, Daniel helps Johan look for his dog. Johan thanks Daniel and reveals that he is the leader of the God Dogs. Still hesitant, he decides to ask his second in command to confirm whether Daniel is a friend or not.
God Dog Arc
When Jin Jang gets beaten by Vasco, he lies that Vasco wanted to start a gang war with Johan. Johan gets angry and decides to go to war with the Burn Knuckles. Johan sends his gang members to find the Burn Knuckles and pay them back. He approaches Vasco and challenges him to a fight, but Vasco refuses to fight back. Despite all of his fighting skills, Johan cannot overpower Vasco. He is angry and decides to leave.
Johan asks Daniel to meet him in a park later, and offers him a position in God Dog, saying he trusts Daniel and that they will make a great team. Daniel refuses because he doesn't want to be a part of a gang. Johan gets angry and in response decides to beat Daniel before he is attacked by his gang mutinying, who say that they were never friends to begin with. Johan is in the middle of destroying his gang when Gun shows up to tell him he is disqualified from being his successor. Johan begs him to reconsider, but Gun refuses because he is terrible at leading his gang, let alone four gangs.
Johan tries to fight Gun but he is tired and easily outmatched. Gun decides to take out his teeth when Zack interferes and begins fighting on Johan's behalf. He is stunned at how unified Daniel's friends are and how much they care about him, unlike his own gang. He decides to run away again, and breaks his wish bracelet as well.
Runaway Fam Arc
Johan comes to Gangdong to ask Olly Wang where Gun is. Olly begins teasing him, so they start fighting until Jerry Kwon breaks them up. Olly Wang offers Johan a meal if he sits down to talk business with them, and he agrees to come, but refuses to join Hostel.
Jin Jang asks Johan to help him get revenge, and if he does then he will tell him where Gun is. When he asks about Jake, Jin Jang says he will leave Jake out of their business. When the meal is done, Johan gets up to leave but is stopped by the waiter, who asks him to pay the bill. He is confused, because Olly Wang promised to pay the bill, but it turns out he lied.
One Night
Johan boards a train to Cheongliang to meet the CEO of HNH group, who is also Gun's boss. He believes that if he reveals who he is and gives the money then he will help move his mother up the waiting list. On the way there, he spots Jace hanging out with a girl from Hostel. Confused at his intentions, he reveals to Jace that he is falling in love with an enemy member.
Johan follows Jace to a restaurant so he can watch the news, and witnesses Seth Lee take the girl away. Jace approaches him to ask him to help find the girl and he refuses, because he doesn't trust Jace. Later on he reconsiders, and accepts to help him while emphatizing they are not friends: they are signing a contract, with Jace paying his meal, and Johan helping him out for that one night. The contract is for Johan an insurance so that Jace doesn't lie to him like Olly did.
The two of them wander around Cheongliang looking for the girl, first at a tea house, and then at a gambling house. When Seth Lee attacks Jace, Johan decides to fight him and wins. They make it to the girl, who is blocked by the uncles of Hostel. However, when they see Johan they get scared and clear the way for him to walk through. Jace asks Johan to stay and help some more but he refuses, because his contract is over.
The next day, Johan confronts the CEO. When he recognizes Johan as a gang leader he ignores him and tells Goo to take care of him. Goo kicks Johan's money out of his hands and Johan decides to fight him, but gets beaten badly. Before he leaves, Goo tells him that he stands a chance against Gun.
Hostel
As Johan was indebted to him, Jace asked him to watch over his friends in Gangdong and help them out if necessary. Johan watch from the top of a building the fight between team J High (Daniel, Zack, Vasco, Logan, Vin, Jay and Eli) with Hostel B, and team Hostel A, supported by Jerry Kwon and K House. At one point, Johan judges he should go down and help them, but seeing how things turn out with the arrival of Derek and Max, he decides his help is not needed and just leaves.
Workers (4th Affiliate)
Johan
visits
Justin
and
Chuck
at a food stall and asks if they know where
Gun
is. They tell him they don't, and they're also too busy to search for him.
Zack
sits down next to him and asks Johan if he's ready to go home now. Johan says he's never listened to Zack before, so the latter decides to beat him and take him home regardless.
VS Johan Seong
Johan and
Zack
begin fighting as Zack swears to bring him home. Johan is surprised to see how strong Zack became, but he is still stronger than him. He missed on one shot, and Zack realizes that Johan is going blind. When Zack asks why
his mother
isn't enough of a reason to return, Johan tells Zack that revenge is all he has left. His mother will be heartbroken if she realizes that he is going blind as well. Zack swears to help Johan defeat
Gun
and the
four crews.
Johan goes to the White Tiger agency for an interview.
Johan later goes to White Tiger Job Center to ask about
Gun's
whereabouts.
Tom Lee
asks him to spar as practice, and Johan gets tossed around but is still standing. Tom is impressed by Johan, thinking that he had not expected to see someone as talented as
Goo
or Gun during his lifetime. Tom recruits Johan as an intern for his company, despite his protests.
Jake Kim
After the
chairman of Workers
asked him on the phone to send his men back to the Workers,
Tom Lee
decides to send an intern (Johan) to the third affiliate.
One Night II
Sent to the third affiliate as White Tiger Company's intern, Johan enters in Vivi's room on Jake bullshitting his way into being hired by pretending to be the one sent by the White Tiger. Johan recognizes Jake, who then attempts to leave, but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar.
Jake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer to find more information about
Sinu
. As Vasco is raising a commotion and fighting the guards, Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen. In reality, Xiaolung is setting them up for failure as he expects both of them to be defeated by Vasco. He doesn't trust the White Tiger because he thinks the chairman of Workers is using them to spy on the third affiliate.
The two of them confront Vasco, but he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo (
Taehun Seong
). Johan and Jake decide to take turns to fight Vasco, 10 minutes each.
Johan is fighting well using only his taekwondo. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.
Johan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them.
Club
Johan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers.
As Jake left with Daniel, believing he must know something about Sinu Han since he is a VVIP, Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
Johan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him.
Later, Jake switch off with him as bouncer.
Workers (3rd Affiliate)
Zack, Vasco and Eli coming to rescue Daniel are blocked by Johan. He refuses to move since
Xiaolong
promised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job. As the three are having a hard time fighting Johan, Vasco and Zack catch his legs to allow Eli to go ahead without them. When he disappears inside, Zack tells Vasco that he should go as well to help save people, although he is not sure if he can beat Johan.
As team J High and Big Deal's Jake, Jerry and Lineman are fighting their way up the building, Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he’s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn’t need help, since Johan is reliable enough.
Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.
As Xiaolung called for backup against the Big Deal's intruders, Johan makes  his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he’s working with the third affiliate when they’re responsible for the Punsang cult. Sowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.
Hwang Ho and Vasco prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away.
Eli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan orders him to give the badge or else he will kill him.
Johan throws Eli’s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna’s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.
As Samuel, Jake and Jerry are struggling against the drugged body of Big Daniel in ultra instinct, Samuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.
Johan’s past enemies and friends hype up how powerful he is as he’s fighting Daniel’s UI form, with Samuel and Jake watching. UI Daniel uses the kyokushin and a triple kick on Johan, followed by systema and capoeira. While Johan is simply copying moves, Daniel has mastered them. Johan does know that he's outmatched, but he keeps fighting in order to gain some experience for fighting Gun, until he is eventually overpowered.

—Justin Peng  in
episode TBA
Justin Peng is a minor character in Lookism.
Appearance
Justin and Chuck both have black hair and various scars on their faces. Justin has short black hair with sideburns. He dresses in a full black outfit with a hoodie.
Personality
Justin and Chuck share similar personalities. They are both ruthless in their fighting and willing to employ any method to defeat their enemies, grabbing necklaces and double teaming. They don't believe in fair fighting, and claim that in a fight the only thing that matters is winning.
Relationships
Justin and Chuck were tested by Big Deal's No. 1 Jake Kim, who dictated that the duo's dirty tactics were not suited for Big Deal. Soon after, the two were taken under the wing of Hostel A Olly Wang, who took a liking to their unethical and desperate need to survive. The duo served Olly as right-hand men up to the day of his passing.
Synopsis
History
Justin and Chuck are Chinese immigrants who came to Korea for a better life. They grew up on the streets and often were victims of street fighting, but they learned quickly and were able to defend themselves. They initially wanted to join Big Deal but
Jake
refused because their fighting style was too dirty for him.
[
1
]
Olly Wang
admired their skills and allowed them into Hostel A, where they have been ever since.
Fighting Prowess
The duo is known for their skill as fighting partners and was acknowledged by both Olly and Jake. They are so talented that they are compared to the heads of the crews. Despite their skill as a duo, they were unable to defeat
Daniel
and
Zack
,
[

]
and were too scared to challenge
Johan Seong
alone.
[
3
]
Though they do have impressive endurance as they were able to recover from their battle between Daniel and Zack with relative ease.
Quotes
"We did whatever it took to survive. We survived by fighting to the death."
[

]
"Do you think a two on one is cowardly? We grew up in that kind of battlefield. There's no such thing as an unfair fight. The only rule if there's any, is that you gotta win!"

Synopsis
Episode 180
Jiho
grows accustomed to the fact that he is now in juvie. He enters the cell and is intimidated by the inmates, but realizes that they are scared of him. There is a color system in juvie, and he is a rank above them because he is there for violent crime. There are four ranks in juvenile prison:
White (petty crime; theft, scams)
Yellow (violent crime: rape, attempted murder)
Red (actual murder)
Blue (drug offenses)
Jiho's cellmate
Darius
orders him to clean the toilets because he is a newbie and Jiho obliges until he realizes he is a rank about him. He protests that he does not need to be treated like this and Darius removed his shirt to reveal he is also the same rank as Jiho.
Episode 181
Jiho is made to do all the tasks in his cell because he is the newbie. He gets the worst conditions but puts up with it because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. While in prison he spots a plant in his room and takes care of it, telling it to be strong like him. Wally Lee returns from solitary confinement and is placed in Jiho's cell. He is happy to see his plant is watered.
Meanwhile, Darius begins working out, which is illegal in juvie. He tells Jiho to keep guard but he falls asleep, and all the inmates get demerits. The inmates hold him down and prepare to beat him but Wally intervenes with a sawed toothbrush, telling them to back off.
Episode 182
Wally stabs Darius and begins fighting him. Darius kicks him and Wally bites his foot and is sent to solitary. After the incident Jiho finds his life improving by a lot. He realizes that Wally is protecting him, but doesn't know what for. He begins to neglect the plant.
Jiho wakes up in the middle of the night to find Darius in his sheets. He tells Darius to stop being a freak, and Darius starts beating him. Two hours later Jiho's roommates cannot sleep because he is still crying. When Wally returns, Jiho is happy to see him. Wally is distressed that his plant is dying, and turns his rage towards Jiho.
Episode 183
Wally tries to kill Jiho but is stopped by the prison guards. Jiho begins pulling his hair in self harm to cope with his stress. As Jiho is sitting in the cafeteria Darius begins bullying him, tossing his fish at Jiho. Brad Lee slams his face with his tray for splattering
Jake Kim
, who is sitting nearby. Darius challenges Jake but backs off when he sees who he is fighting. After Jake beats him he claims Jake is innocent, and begins bullying Jiho.
In Jiho's cell he witnesses Darius step on a bug, saying that he will be back to beat Jiho more. The bug does not die, but gets up after the beating. Jiho finds hope that he can survive his situation. In the bathroom, Jiho sneaks up on Darius who is taking a shower with a blunt weapon and decides to attack him.
Episode 184
Jiho is placed in solitary confinement for attacking Darius. As he is in solitary, Jiho starts devolving mentally and physically. He starts self harming and they have to handcuff him and shave his head. He is tormented by the faces of the people he's hurt in the past, like Daniel, James and Darius.
As Jiho screams in agony he hears a neighbor tell him to shut up and stop putting himself down. Jiho begins speaking to the neighbor and he encourages Jiho to fight back and that he did nothing wrong in the past. Jiho gains the courage to fight Darius, and challenges him in the yard.
Episode 185
The prisoners take bets on how long Jiho will last, and Jake is the only one to bet on Jiho winning the match. Darius brutally beats Jiho but every time Jiho falls he gets back up. Jiho begins fighting dirty, biting Darius's nose and spitting his loose teeth into his eye. As Darius is blinded, Jiho grabs his bandage and begins to choke him. Jiho is stopped by the prison guards and is happy to have won the fight. Jake bribes the guards and smiles at Jiho, stating he was the only one who won in this situation.
Cookie 1
Jiho is being moved to Jake's cell. As he is finished beating the inmates, he asks Jake why he bet on him. Jake tells him it was his eyes that sold him.
Cookie 2
Jiho being released from solitary. As he walks away he looks into his neighbor's cell and tells him he will come back for him. The neighbor tells him not to worry because he will be fine. That neighbor was Jiho's old self.
Notes
"The eyes that wanted to kill him" is a phrase repeated a lot from this arc on, like the
Eli Jang arc
It is implied that Darius sexually assaulted Jiho in Episode 182. It was later confirmed in a PTJ blog post.

, who draws a cute picture of a house and says he likes Mr. Kim's fidget spinner. Mr. Kim takes the drawing to be a sign that Jiho craves affection, and tells Jiho that he is a good kid and shouldn't lose himself.
When Mr. Kim talks to the prison guards they say they cannot move Jiho from his cell. He is angry because he thinks Jiho will be harassed by Darius, who he thinks is the leader of the cell. The guards tell him that Jiho is the leader of the cell, and that he is not a nice kid. In his cell, Jiho is shown shaving the eyebrows of Riley and enjoying the terrified look on his face.
In the prison yard, the leaders of the cells are fighting each other for a position in
Big Deal
. Jason Yoon and Brad Lee recommend one fighter based on his strength, but that fighter is overwhelmed by a sneak attack from Jiho.
Jake
is pleased with Jiho's development but his underlings are not. Once Jake leaves, Jason attacks Jiho and tells him off for fighting dirty. Jiho doesn't care about fairness and says he can beat Jason as well. Jason challenges Jiho to beat him, and Jiho accepts.
Later in a woodshop Jiho appears behind Jason, who is cutting wood. He asks if Jiho plans to push him like he pushed Daniel. Jiho says that the only thing he regrets about pushing
Daniel
is that he did not get someone else to do it for him. At these words, Wally pushes Jason into the saw.
Episode 265
Jason Yoon is saved from the saw by the juvenile prison guards. Mr. Kim watches as Jiho and Wally are taken into custody. He tries to convince one of the guards that Jiho was not to blame for the incident, but the guard does not buy it. He shows Mr. Kim photographs of Jiho's victims as evidence of his sadistic personality. The guard believes Jiho is pretending to be kind until a decision to release him is made, but Mr. Kim insists that he is innocent because his picture showed an unconscious desire for warmth.
In the prison yard Jiho is being beaten by Brad Lee as revenge for his attack on Jason Yoon. Brad describes to Jiho that what makes Big Deal great is its idealism. He tells Jiho off for his cruelty, but Jiho insists that the only way he can win is to fight savagely. Jake takes Jiho's side and allows him into Big Deal, kicking out Jason because he lost. Brad is sad that Jake is changing, and wonders what to tell Jerry.
In the cafeteria Mr. Kim sits down with Jiho and asks him to turn himself in. He mentions that Jiho used to be different in high school, and tells him he can change. Jiho tells Mr. Kim that he has left his old self behind and knocks him out with his food tray. Guards swarm in and Brad thinks it is over for Jiho, but the inmates confess to his crime instead of Jiho. Brad sees the dangerous level of influence Jiho had on the inmates and is afraid that Jiho will lead to the destruction of Big Deal.
Cookies
Cookie 1 occurs directly after Jiho knocks out Mr. Kim. As he stands over his body, he places the fidget spinner in his mouth and smiles that he completed the picture. The picture that Mr. Kim thought was of a house was actually a picture of himself with the spinner in his mouth, foreshadowing the violence Jiho had towards the counselor.
Cookie 2 is Jiho standing after having beaten a number of inmates. He kept the fidget spinner from Mr. Kim and affirms that he doesn't need to be strong, he just needs to win.
Cookie 3 is the guards deciding who to release. They decide between Jiho or Jake.

Kenta Magami (マガミ・ケンタ
Magami Kenta
)
also known as "
Daruma
" One of the executives of the 2nd affiliated company of the
Workers
, Oyabun of the Magami faction, a Japanese yakuza organization.
Appearance
Daruma is a young man who wears a black suit and a mask. He has a skeleton-shaped earring and a fade haircut, but there’s a scar on the top of his head and he has both of his pinky fingers missing.
Personality
Relationships
Gun Park
Kenta Magami saw Gun as his idol and sworn brother at first but now he sees him as his mortal enemy because Gun eradicated his clan and killed his father.
Synopsis
Initially, he was the only son of
Ryuujo Magami
, who led the Magami faction, but in the past, his father and members of the Magami faction were killed and brutally dismembered by
Gun Park
. Subsequently, after the restoration of the Magami faction destroyed by Gun Park,
Mitsuki Soma
, who came to Japan to recruit new fighters, told Kenta that Gun Park is in Korea, and went to Korea to get revenge on him.
Fighting Prowess
Matching the title of next-generation oni, superior combat power comparable to the
Four Major Crews
, great fighting scenes and stunts such as setting fire to his index finger right before fighting with
Zack Lee
, and when
Ryuhei Kuroda
flew away after being hit by
Xiaolong
, he calmly took off his mask. One scene appears in the work, for example, preparing for battle, holding on to the end without fainting even after losing a fight with
Jerry Kwon
, and getting out of the car in the episode with the
The Hunt for Big Deal
, warning his opponent,
Jason Yoon
, and then fighting with him on equal terms and subsequently defeating him.
Quotes

“
"King of Busan.. This is going to be tasty. Way tastier than I thought!"
”
— Kitae Kim to Jinrang,
Episode 547
Kitae Kim (
김기태 Kim Gi-Tae
)
is a myth given muscle and motion, a fighter whose combat prowess is considered to be rivaled only by
James Lee
, the legend of the
First Generation
. Son of the famed
“Legendary Fist”
Gapryong Kim
, he anointed himself King of Seoul back when the First Generation bled ambition down every street. It was he who broke
Kwak Jichang’s
spine of influence, forcing the notorious
White Viper
into exile in the fields of Chungcheong Province before retreating to Mexico to oversee his drug empire.
He reappeared on South Korea’s soil as the smoke cleared from the chaos following the
Hunt for Gun
, leveraging his strong ties with
Taejin Cheon
to form a powerful alliance with
Goo Kim’s crew
.
History
Kitae Kim – his name drifts through the strata of
Lookism’s
hidden history like a blade cutting clean through silence. A ghost of the First Generation, Kitae is less remembered as a man and more as the residue of unrelenting violence: an echo of carnage that persists long after the deeds are done. Officially catalogued among the First Generation fighters, his history is defined more by speculation than by fact.
What little is known suggests a life rooted in bloodshed. Born an illegitimate son of Gapryong Kim, Kitae was introduced into a world that excluded him by default. Denied legitimacy, whether out of shame, scandal, or sheer neglect, his early years are a stain largely scrubbed from the Kim family’s history. At some point, under circumstances lost to rumor, he vanished from Korea and resurfaced in Tijuana, Mexico, where he immersed himself in the brutal heart of a violent cartel and forged his identity in blood.
The official details surrounding his father’s death remain ambiguous. Yet Kitae’s involvement was implied, hinting it was not peripheral but decisive. Some accounts suggest he masterminded the entire affair, driven to obliterate any legacy that might overshadow his own ascent. According to fragments of surviving rumor, he conspired with James Lee and Charles Choi to eliminate Gapryong Kim and his most loyal ally,
Baekho Kwon
, in a single coordinated blow. This double execution dismantled the last organized resistance of the older generation, clearing the path for Choi’s corporate empire and Kitae’s reign of sheer physical dominance.
Appearance
Kitae is a very tall and muscular man with sunken black eyes and slicked black hair with a single loose bang, His outfit consists in a black eather jacket that cover its shirtless abdomen, a black belt that has a silver fivel with blue jean pants and dark brown boots . He is stated to look eerily similar to Jake, possessing longer lashes through silhouettes. When his appearance was finally revealed, his hairstyle was notably similar to the one seen worn by Daniel Park's second body in the dream. He also carries with him a hatchet wherever he goes.
When he arrived in Korea, he wears a red polo shirt with white stripes, dark gray pants kept with silver chains that holds a brown smoking pipe with a silver lighter and black pants These items are told to be items descended from Gapryong Kim himself to his children- who Kitae killed.
Personality
Minseon Kang’s terse verdict—describing Kitae as
“the evil side”
of Gapryong Kim—offers perhaps as the most accurate lens through which to understand him. He is not simply a violent man; he is the concentrated core of his father’s ferocity, stripped of any pretense of conscience, loyalty, or restraint. Where Gapryong Kim’s strength carried a semblance of purpose, Kitae embodies the same force liberated from any ethical boundary.
A closer examination of his behavior reveals not just a killer, but a psychopath so utterly habituated to his own depravity that atrocity becomes mundane. For Kitae, violence is not a reaction to conflict but a fundamental expression of existence. He does not kill because he must, but because his inner world places no inherent value on human life. His willingness to butcher anyone with a hatchet speaks volumes: he favors violence in its rawest, most personal incarnation—face to face, immersed in the victim’s final moments.
One of the clearest glimpses into his psyche comes from a single act: his casual walk through the streets of Seoul, his clothes soaked in fresh blood. This scene exposes a man utterly indifferent to social order and consequence. The fear of authority, the sting of guilt, the shame that might haunt lesser criminals—none of these apply to him. His only reflection on the aftermath is tellingly neutral: he notes, almost analytically, that Korean police operate “quickly,” contrasting it with his experiences in Mexico. To him, a murder scene is not a moral reckoning but a logistical detail to be catalogued for future reference.
Relationships
0th Generation
Gapryong Kim
Analyzing Kitae Kim’s connection to his father, Gapryong Kim, demands an admission that their “relationship” never fit any sane definition of “father and son.”
From the moment Kitae clawed his way into the world, he was branded filth in flesh—a bastard spawned from the moment of a great man’s weakness, an aberration that mocked the legacy of the “Fist” more than it upheld it. In a society where bloodline sanctifies identity, Kitae was not heir, but a shameless wound left to rot in plain sight—a living proof that even someone like the almighty “Fist” could rot from within.
His resentment then, is not some petty grudge born of paternal neglect. It is the logical byproduct of a world that exiles the illegitimate as if they carry disease. The damage calcified into purpose. In Tijuana, where the Kim name meant nothing, he underwent a violent rebirth. What emerged was not a runaway son, but a man who became his own god, enthroned atop an empire of blood and terror.
Patricide was the crowning honor of this self-made myth. Though the public record brands James Lee the killer,
Jinyoung Park’s
delirious confession—that Kitae himself ended the Fist’s life—strips the lie bare. He did not simply murder a father; he obliterated a monument. His father’s final breath was a boy’s last, desperate plea to be
seen
.
And yet the corpse did not silence the hunger. If anything, death only metastasized it. Kitae’s obsession bloomed into ritual: hunting half-brothers scattered like filth across Gapryong’s secret life, tearing them apart not merely to kill, but to hoard every scrap of fatherly affection they clung to that he was denied of. By murdering them and tearing their keepsakes from their corpses, he desecrates them and feeds on their ghosts, stealing the father he could not inherit in life in an attempt to feel whole again.
Thus, to call Kitae’s connection to Gapryong merely “bad” is a coward’s understatement. What binds him is not just resentment, but an obsessive, cannibalistic need for him. His empire is a mausoleum built atop Gapryong’s bones. Every corpse Kitae leaves rotting beneath foreign sun is an offering to him—a hope that somewhere beneath the blood and ruin, his father will look back through dead eyes and know him at last.
1st Generation
James Lee
At some point in the past, before the developments of Cheonliang, James Lee killed Gapryong Kim, with Kitae being implied to have helped him. He would then go to Mexico for an extended period, returning to South Korea to dethrone Jichang Kwak upon James' request, before returning to the Americas.
Though the two are suggested to have once worked under Charles Choi along with
Gun Park
and
Goo Kim
to create the Four Major Crews, how their relationship developed afterward is still unclear. James Lee and Gitae Kim appear to be on friendly terms, as seen in the Cheonliang Flashback.
Synopsis
History
Not much is known about his past, what is known is that he was involved in the death of
Gapryong Kim
, and that
James Lee
sent him to defeat
Jichang Kwak
, and steal his throne as the King of Seoul, succeeding in both.
Fighting Prowess
Daniel Park copying Kitae's brutal strikes in Ultra Instinct
His combat power is said by
Gongseob Ji
to be "the peak of the 1st Generation", therefore, he was one of the few kings who along with Jichang Kwak (albeit for different reasons, Jichang spared out of pity), had nothing taken away by
James Lee
. (However, this could also be attributed to the two being on the same side during the 1st generation.).
Furthermore, his fighting style does not seem to possess a specific "technique," instead embodying raw strength and speed. He is described to have the speed of Gongseob Ji and the power of Taesoo Ma in his fists by Jichang Kwak during their fight while heavily holding back. Kitae also possesses enough power to mirror Jichang's hand blade, though rather than chopping with the side of his hand, he stabbed the side of Jichang's hand itself by only using his fingers, digging underneath the skin up to Kitae's second knuckle.
Later in the Busan arc, Gitae has demonstrated
Mastery
in Resistance
, coming out practically unharmed from all the attacks he has suffered to date. The only one who has injured him was Jinrang when he surpassed his limits after witnessing the death of his brothers, reaching a new level of
Conviction
, and even then the damage was superficial. Even when several police officers used tasers on him and discharged a shock throughout his body, he remained unperturbed until calmly answering a cell phone.
It has been noted that Kitae tries to imitate others, though rather than being the true copying talent, as held by Jinyoung Park and Johan Seong, Kitae's imitation is just a cheap facsimile, instead supplementing his lack of talent with pure brute force, shown when he tried to imitate Jichang Kwak's handblade.

Lang Jin
is the disciple of
Gapryong Kim
, part of the
1st Generation
and the King Of Busan, the second largest city in Korea. He was imprisoned during the 1st Generation for killing the previous King of Busan- Dalyoung Oh. Upon his release from prison, he went back to Busan where his crew reunited under him.
He was later confronted by
Allied
and Kings Of the 1st Generation.
Appearance
Lang Jin appears to be a tall and muscular man in either his late twenties or early thirties. He has sunken black eyes, scruffy black hair with a short goatee accompained by a moustache, as well a unusual scar below his left eye that resembles scales. Upon his release from prison, he is shown wearing a black polo shirt under a dark gray business suits and black pants (he occasionally wears a white shirt instead). He also wears golden-yellow rings on both hands that read 'Busan' and 'Purgatory'. After his fight against Kitae Kim, Lang permanently lost his left arm after having it get chopped off by the former King.
His trademark part of his appareance is the large tattoo on his back shaped like a realistic wolf head.
Personality
An unwanted person since birth, without even having a name, Lang Jin grew up being raised to never disobey those at the top of the hierarchy and to obey them like a dog. Thus, Lang in the past was someone without any ambition or prospects for growth in life, doing the minimum to live and the possible to protect
Jungseok Hwang
and
Sang Baek
, who he considers his little brothers.
For a long time, Lang maintained this lifestyle and thinking, until he heard
Jichang Kwak's
scolding, which made him realize that his lack of ambition and perspective kept him hostage to fate, which also affected his little brothers. After that, he fights against Dayoung Oh, ceasing to be a dog and consolidating himself as the "Wolf".
Later, Lang extends his protective personality to all of Busan. And after returning from prison, he shows great hatred towards James Lee and anyone who threatens Busan or
his family
.
He is also very charismatic, and not without mercy, such as his fight against Gongseob Ji, he showed mercy when the latter was down and unable to get back up. He is also a capable leader, being able to boost the positive energy within the people of Busan after he defeated the previous King of Busan; gaining the respect of all of Busan's people.
Fighting Prowess
As the first champion of the Busan underworld and one of the kings of the 1st Generation, Lang Jin is one of the strongest characters in the series, being feared and respected throughout Busan. He easily took down two members of the Allies with just one blow each without them having time to react, applying enough force to dent a steel container and open a crater in a concrete floor with the force of his blows. He is powerful enough to fight simultaneously against the kings of
Daegu
and
Ansan
, having the upper hand for most of the fight by withstanding their strongest attacks without faltering while inflicting heavy damage on them. He was so powerful that even
Daniel Park
had to use the fighting style of the former
King of Seoul
. Despite being in his perfect body fighting against Jinrang - who was injured by the previous fight against two kings of the 1st Generation, Daniel still proved to be inferior in an exchange of blows with the King of Busan, who surpassed him in both strength and endurance.
Using the Gapryong Kim Style, he can wield the rare
Mastery
of Conviction
, which allows him to surpass his limits with his strong will to protect those he cares about, even delivering very powerful and destructive punches capable of destroying the strongest defenses and even overcoming users of the
Mastery of Resistance
and inflicting critical damage.
Lang Jin, even injured and tired from previous fights, managed to remain conscious after an attack by
Gitae Kim
and after witnessing the death of his foster brothers Baek and Hwang to protect him, Lang reached a new level of "Conviction" represented by the intense purple glow in his eyes and his scar that increased his strength, speed and resistance to the point of pressuring and even forcing Gitae to keep his guard up to protect himself from his attacks that were hurting him and making him bleed, something that none of the other characters in the work managed to do. The power of his punches were so strong that the bones in his arms were beginning to break with each blow exerting a force greater than his body could withstand.
Wolf Style
Lang Jin's fighting style consists of using his elbows to fight in close quarters for both offense and defense, being compared to "fangs" being able to cut and inflict serious damage to the Kings of Daegu and Ansan and easily block most of their attacks.
Gapryong Kim Style
Lang Jin's true strength lies in his fists. As a former disciple of
Gapryong Kim
, he learned from him his techniques and fighting style, which consisted of charging his fists with
Conviction
: the desire to protect. His punches were so powerful that with just one blow he was able to knock out the King of Daegu in a counterattack. Even Daniel Park's copying ability proven to be ineffective when he tried to copy this style, as he only replicated the movements but not the "Conviction" behind the punches, which led to Lang describing them as "Empty Fists". At the height of his fight against Gitae, Jirang reached a new level of "Conviction" that surpassed all his limits where his punches became so powerful that the bones in his hand broke with the impact of his blows that pressured Gitae to raise his guard to protect himself as they were capable of injuring him and making him bleed.

Lasol
is currently the leader of Class A girls at
PTJ Entertainment
. She is good friends with
Jang Udon
. Her solo debut is approaching.
Appearance
Lasol is slim and is considered attractive which was part of the reason she was selected for debuting. She has wavy brown hair which extends to her mid-back. It is usually left free. She has light skin. She usually wears simple and comfortable clothes.
Personality
Lasol is a very kind and caring and polite person. She also seems to be a good teacher. She is also observant which can be seen when she noticed that Aru was feeling upset because she didn't get a chance to debut.
History
Lasol used to be the leader of Class A girls which she accomplished in her first year itself. She became good friends with Jang Udon and
Aru
and used herself as a cover for them to make it seems like Udon and Aru were just friends.
Later the Abo Investment Firm Rep who's name was Park Jin who was investing in a girls group gave Lasol and two other girls (Eunda and Sook) from Class A a chance to debut.
Park Jin and their boss - Mr. Jang - took her aside to see her in person. Park Jin offered to support her completely if she would date him. It seemed that she refused even though she was scared because she didn't debut.
After Aru debuted, Aru abandoned Lasol and Lasol was demoted to be the leader of Class C when
Daniel Park
,
Pyeon Duk Hwa
and
Hong Jae Hye
joined
PTJ Entertainment
.
Relationships
Jang Udon
As leaders of Class A, Lasol and Udon were very close friends. They were so close that Lasol was the only one to know that Udon and Aru were dating - an action that might lead to PTJ Entertainment kicking the trainees out. She helped them keep it as a secret using herself as a cover to make it seem that Udon and Aru were just friends.
They remained close friends even after Aru betrayed them.
Aru Lee
Lasol became extremely close with Aru when they were trainees. They were so close that Lasol was the only one to know that Udon and Aru were dating - an action that might lead to PTJ Entertainment kicking the trainees out. She helped them keep it as a secret using herself as a cover to make it seem that Udon and Aru were just friends.
On Lasol's birthday, Aru was broke and couldn't buy a gift. So gave Lasol her precious IPOT. Lasol considered it as a treasure and carried it everywhere with her.
After Lasol overheard about Park Jin's offer to Aru, she kept a distance from Lasol. Their friendship broke down. But even after that, she helped save Aru.
Synopsis
PTJ Entertainment Arc
Lasol, along with Jang Udon, was the leader of the newly formed Class C when
Daniel Park
,
Pyeon Duk Hwa
and
Hong Jae Hye
joined
PTJ Entertainment
. During the Aru nude shot scandal, Lasol went to confront Park Jin and their boss along with
Choi Soo Jung
and the rest of Class C.
She claimed and proved that she had actually recorded Park Jin's offer and said that she'll give up the recording if let Aru go. But the brothers found a way to cheat through the agreement and trapped them to get the recording and delete it.
Lasol and the group were surrounded by men recruited by Park Jin to beat them up. But
Jong Gun
and
Joon Goo
showed up and along with Daniel Park and
Vasco
defeated all of them (though Gun and Goo were fighting each other).
The
HNH Group CEO
showed up and with
DG
's help dismissed Mr Jang as the CEO of

.
Lasol was once again promoted back to being the leader of Class A girls and her solo debut is approaching.

—Sung Lee  in
episode TBA
Lee Hyun Seung
is a minor character in
Lookism
. He is the tattoo artist who helped Euntae Lee.
Appearance
Hyun Seung has black hair that is shaved off at the sides but piled up on top like icing in a cupcake.
He has tattoos all over his upper body, starting from his neck and ending at his wrists. He also has a Poirot-esque mustache and ear piercings, which shows he's rather fashionable.
To add on to his stereotypical Western European fashion sense, when he walks out of his shop into the snow in winter, he's wearing a light brown trench coat over his blue, pinstriped waistcoat, his white chemise, a tucked in red tie, and, to top it all off, he has a pair of dark brown leather gloves and a lovely brown scarf.
Personality
He is kind but also rather suspecting, as he thought that Euntae was a bully at first when Jace came to tell Hyun Seung that Euntae needed cover ups.
He's law abiding, as shown when he first rejected Jace because giving middle schoolers tattoos is illegal.
Later, though, he also shows he's rather softhearted when he, moved by Jace's earnesty, decides to help give Euntae and Jace tattoos anyways to cover up the bullies' tattoos as well as help Euntae get over his fear of needles.
Later, he was sincerely shocked when he saw the bullies' drawings, and, when he sees Jace go with Euntae to get tattoos, he says that Jace is a really good friend.
Finally, when Euntae's cover ups are finished in a year,
Relationships
Jace Park
Jace came to beg Hyun Seung to give Euntae coverups for the bullies' drawings. Although Hyun Seung refuses initially, he agrees after witnessing Jace's earnesty and later realizes what a good friend Jace is to Hyun Seung.
Euntae Lee
Hyun Seung thought Euntae was a gangster at first when Jace came asking him for tattoos. Hence, he was shocked to see that Jace had told the truth and that the bullies actually had drawn on Euntae's body. After a year, the coverups are done and Euntae was no longer afraid of needles.
Synopsis
Euntae Lee Arc
When Jace realizes Euntae had developed a fear of needles due to bullying, he begs Hyun Seung to help give Euntae coverups, telling Hyun Seung he can practice on Jace first so Euntae wouldn't be as scared.
Hyun Seung initially refuses him because it's illegal to give middle school students tattoos. However, Jace persists, going so far as to kneel in the snow, asking Hyun Seung for help. Finally, Hyun Seung relents and Jace gets a bird tattoo because he knows Euntae likes birds. Euntae, who loves the bird tattoo, happily agrees to get one too.
Hyun Seung comments that Jace is a really good friend when he comes with Euntae to get tattoos and acts like nothing had happened even though he had been shivering in fear earlier.
Moreover, after a year, when Euntae's coverups were done, Hyun Seung notices that they both look like they've been working out. Jace, grinning, says that they've both been working out like crazy for a year, and Hyun Seung, realizing it's because of Euntae, again says that Jace is a really good friend.

"
It's alright if you don't win. It's alright if you fail miserably. Just don't give up. That's what Big Deal is about.
"
—Lineman challenging Huseong Ha  in
episode
331
Lineman
is a supporting character in Lookism, and a member of Big Deal.
Appearance
Lineman has short black hair in the back and a mowhawk at the front. He wears his uniform in school, and Big Deal's suit when at Big Deal events. While infiltrating Club ViVi, he wore a black tracksuit.
Personality
Lineman used to be very cocky during his middle school years, shaping up once he met Jake Kim. He is brave enough to challenge characters much stronger than himself, such as Huseong Ha, to save people. He admires Big Deal immensely and strives to uphold their values even when he is scared.
Relationships
Big Deal
Jake Kim
Lineman is very close to Jake Kim. Lineman is No.6 of Big Deal and has always looked up to Jake Kim. He quoted that Jake taught him to never give up or run away and he regrets not being able to call Jake while he was in prison.
[
1
]
Jake has even stated that he considers Lineman to be a part of his family.
[
2
]
Jerry Kwon
Lineman is the only character to know about Jerry's strength. They are close and both really loyal to
Jake Kim
. Jerry and Lineman have a teasing friendship, they both tease each other a lot. Lineman due to his resilience was also used as a human sword by Jerry in the
Workers (3 Affiliates)
Arc.
[
3
]
0th Generation
Bongae Choi
In the latest chapter, Bongae offered Lineman a chance to become stronger by learning from him, comparing Lineman to how he was in the past. As such, it is likely that Lineman will become Bongae's pupil.
Synopsis
History
Lineman used to be the head of the troublesome Monster crew in C Middle School, where
Jerry Kwon
used to go. He was responsible for collecting dues from the school and giving it to members of
Big Deal
. Lineman was a known liar, and he would often make up stories about being great to earn praise from other students.
When Lineman was asked about Jerry Kwon, he lied and said he beat him. He tried to collect dues from Jerry and in the process knocked over his bamboo flute. When Jerry told him to pick it up, he smashed his flute. Jerry got angry at Lineman but decided to leave him be.
Lineman continued to spread lies about Jerry until he learned that he was the same Jerry Kwon from Big Deal. When
Jake Kim
arrived at school, the other students exposed Lineman for lying about being friends with Jake. Jake was touched that Lineman thought highly of him, and accepted him into Big Deal. Lineman decided to follow Jake wherever he goes.
Eli Jang (Arc)
Lineman makes his first appearance in Jerry Kwon's flashback in middle school when he led Monstar.
Workers (3rd Affiliate)
Lineman took part in aiding Jake in his mission against Hotel Vivi, inadvertedly aiding Daniel.
Fighting Prowess
Lineman is not very strong but he is very resilient. He is able to withstand many hits without knocking out. He is a weak character when it comes to fighting but he is very determined to never give up and to keep hanging in there, no matter how badly he is in pain.
During the Incheon Arc, after training with Bongae Choi, a member of the 0th Generation, he claims to be at his "Peak" surpassing the strength he had in the past, a demonstration of his evolution and when he preferred to run rather than take public transport because it was faster to get to Incheon on foot. He has shown to have acquired the
Mastery
of Speed
which allows him to run as fast as vehicles and keep up with their speed, whenever he uses it instead of the typical blue aura an aura of lightning appears probably due to inheriting the will of Bongae Choe who was known as "Lightning Choi".

Logan Lee
(이태성 Lee Tae Sung)
is a former student of the comics department of J High School, and
Daniel Park's
archenemy.
Appearance
Logan is a young man with a overweight, yet buff, build. He is also tall, at 190 cm (6’3”) and became even taller later, making him one of the tallest characters in Lookism, possibly to make him more intimidating as an antagonist. He has black hair that stands up abnormally. Logan is usually seen with a bored face due to nothing entertaining him, such as a fight. Most of the time, he is seen either looking down upon those who are weak or glaring angrily at males who are considered attractive. He has a signature scowl of belittlement and judgment on his face when being called out. Due to his large size, his neck barely tapers to give a depth of his head to shoulder ratio.
Logan is usually seen wearing a black tiger shirt with a loose white dress shirt and slim black jeans. Oftentimes, he prefers not to wear his black shirt and leaves his dress shirt loose to expose the tattoos on his body.
He has a tattoo of Buddha on his stomach and a carp on his right arm. His back and the rest of his body are covered with tattoos in a wing-like pattern.
After being rejected by
Zoe
, Logan was heartbroken and trapped himself within his room for a long time eventually losing a lot of weight and became very thin.
[
4
]
Thin Logan is deemed quite attractive, as girls would stare at him in infatuation as he walked by. His tattoos looked different when he lost weight: his Buddha tattoo appeared as Gandhi, while the carp on his right arm appeared as small as a sardine fish. He did not maintain this look for long. Once he realized he was now attractive, he tried to use his looks to get to Zoe but was rejected again. This caused him to reason power and strength was greater than romance and binge eat his weight back.
Personality
Logan is a hateful person who will beat up anybody, including women. However, when he entered the animation department, he realized that he couldn't bully them because they all appeared to him as sheep.
[
5
]
Logan has a narcissistic attitude and is accompanied by his large, intimidating stature. He is always shown as the leader in the group at his old middle school prior to J High School.
Due to his hunger for blood and violence, he is known to transfer out of many schools.
Logan has a habit of not having people to look down on him, which makes him start up fights.
He has demonstrated his cruel behavior, when he attempted to break Vasco's leg after getting him into a leg lock.
[
6
]
He has a hatred towards women and attractive men due to his poor experiences within middle school. Because of this, he has no sympathy in inflicting pain on either man or woman.
Fighting Prowess
Logan is immensely powerful and strong, able to beat three upperclassmen who were twice his size. He has a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience when it comes to fighting. Logan is powerful in all areas (speed, strength, technique, and power), but his defense is most likely the most significant and distinguished factor which Logan, as an individual, is overwhelmingly best at.
Logan has a body that is perfect for any way of fighting he chooses but focuses most on power and strength since his body allows him to deliver blows with immense strength. Despite his huge stature, Logan is capable of moving at incredible speeds. He was even able to surprise
Zack
(a fighter well known for his speed) with a lightning-quick tackle that won him the fight. Even a tactical approach that focuses on technique is possible for Logan due to his experience in fighting. Best of all is his unbelievable endurance, which is one of the most impressive shows to date. Logan was able to fight 3 of the Jae Won high's top fighters all in one day with no desire to back down. He is able to endure hard jabs and punches, seen when he took multiple shots to the face from Zack without inflicting serious damage.
Logan has exceptional knowledge over wrestling and demonstrated it in when he tackled Zack after transferring to J High School.
[
7
]
One of his signature fighting tactics is to jab his targets straight into the solar plexus. He has demonstrated this many times to
Daniel
,
Zack
,
Vasco
, and
Vin Jin
.
When he had decided to lose weight Logan was faster than Zack Lee but had none of the endurance and strength he once had, thus becoming a punching bag for the entire school.
As noted by Goo during the Hostel Arc Logan has the ability to adapt to one's fighting style, especially if it is weapon oriented, this combined with his jiu-Jitsu, emphasis on dogfighting, his reliance and use of weaponry made him a true monster.
[
8
]
In fact, his endurance is so strong he can even fully recharge his stamina after 30 minutes of rest.
[
9
]
Quotes
"One shot, one kill" - Episode 1
Trivia
After falling in love with Zoe, he was left heartbroken after realizing she was with someone else. After nearly a month, he returns to the school having lost 100 kg. Not only did he lose much of his body mass and muscle (Tattoos of Buddha becoming Gandhi, and a carp into a minnow), but he also became handsome.
[
4
]
Though he realized how wonderful it is to be handsome and be able to influence others, he also became aware of how weak he has become. Despite being more attractive to Zoe, he was rejected for his attitude and returned with an even bigger weight and bigger tendency for violence.
[
10
]
He has an incredible sense of technique, that combined with immense power and size makes him one of the most prominent fighters in the story. Whilst he has held his own against the likes of Vasco, Vin, Jay, Daniel, and Zack; the only fight that he has presumably lost was against Goo. During the Stalker Arc, Goo was seen confronting him due to Lee beating up multiple seniors who were collecting money from the lowerclassmen students, which caused trouble to Gun and Goo's business. Logan later stated that Goo almost broke his shoulder during their fight, and was seen with several bruises and marks on his face in the aftermath when Logan was told that he was transferring schools
Logan is often described as a bear on peak of food chain. However, he is depicted as a raptor when he is furious.

Background
Logan at a young age
During his middle school years, he once dated
Mae's ex-girlfriend
and was considered the King. One day, he was excited to meet his girlfriend after school and hoped to meet her so he could give her a present. He tried to text her in a 'manly' way, asking if she wanted to meet. His girlfriend replied, saying that they couldn't meet because she had a curfew. Not believing this excuse so easily, he replied again repeating his question. Logan looked up to see his girlfriend sitting with another guy across the park. He overheard their conversation in which they were insulting him behind his back and talking about how they should reveal that they're a couple.
Logan's first Appearance in chapter 1
Logan, enraged at his two-faced girlfriend who cheated on him and her boyfriend (who pretended to care about him), punched both of them in the face. From that day onward, he had an inferiority complex around attractive guys and hated girls when it came to romance because he thought that they were shallow people who only care about looks.
Exposition
Logan and a girl are smoking in the bathroom together. He tells Daniel that if a teacher came, Daniel had to use his fat body to stop him. he tells Daniel to act like Pikachu to amuse himself, and puts his wet shoe to Daniel's face to kick him into the urinal.
In the classroom, he nails Daniel in the stomach. His friend laughs with him because he made Daniel faint. Daniel abruptly gets up when he is told to imitate Pikachu, and he imitates Pikachu's thunderbolt move on command. Upon request, he lets his friend borrow Daniel for the day to deliver a gift for a 100th day anniversary.

Pavlov's Dog Arc
He fights Daniel and loses.
Troubled Transfer Arc
He enters to bathroom, mumbling "watashiwa" to himself because the class he was in kept repeating it. Jin Vin and the others in the bathroom hear him and make fun of him for it, and they say he must have been from the comics department.
Jin Vin licks his finger and rubs it on one of Logan's tattoos. Logan asks if he was trying to start something, and Jin Vin just laughs at him, not taking the threat seriously. Jin Vin attempts to spin Logan onto the floor, but Logan grabs him and headbutts him instead. Jin Vin's glasses break and he covers his eyes. Jay-gal Gong sees how Logan took down Jin Vin and is shocked that someone in his department would have skill.
Logan tries to move Jin Vin's eyes away to see his face, but Jin Vin is stubborn and refuses to let anyone see. Teachers come before Logan can finish. Logan goes out the window before he can get caught, and the teachers only see Jin Vin, his two friends, and a broken window.

Jay-gal Gong later goes to Logan and asks to be his friend. Logan slaps him and tells him to avert his eyes. He then stands up and tells everyone not to step out of line, or else they'll be crushed. Jay-gal happily thinks that the comics department could rise. He offers Logan a box f apple juice later in the day, and while Logan thinks that he's annoying, he might also be useful to have around.
Jay-gal sees Zack around, and he gets the idea of starting a fight between Zack and Logan. Logan ends up angry at Zack, and he pours food on Mira. Once Zack had made sure Mira was alright, he throws the first fist at Logan. Logan ends up tackling Zack to the ground and Zack screams, alerting Vasco.

In the cafeteria, Mira returns and steps in front of Zack to defend him. Logan grabs the girl's hair, but Zack gets up and punches him from under the jaw. Before Zack and Logan can get back into their fight, Vasco grabs Logan's shoulder and tells them not to fight. He squeezes Logan's shoulder and Logan falls to the ground.
Jin Vin also returns in a new pair of goggles, and he steps into the door and demands a rematch from Logan. In the end, Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin all challenge Logan to fight. Logan comments that the three are a balance of technique, strength, and speed. He thinks that the school is fun. He takes off his shirt and tells all of them to bring it on. This moment was Logan's debut at the new school.
Daniel shivers as he remembers how Logan bullied him at his old school. Jay glances at Logan, who was the cause of Daniel's shaking. Daniel goes to the nurse for his shaking. Later, Daniel and Logan are on opposite sides of the door to the nurse, and they are about to open it.

First Love Arc
Logan Lee tells Daniel to get out of his way when he walks into the door. He doesn't recognize Daniel, but gets instantly angry at him when Zoe tries to get close to Daniel. He grabs Daniel by the shoulder and is surprised to see that Daniel doesn't immediately collapse. He thinks to himself that Daniel was stronger than Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin. Daniel kneels regardless because it was conditioned in him to kneel down to Logan. Logan is confused and wonders if Daniel was faking it.
Zoe demands that Logan let him go. He thinks that the girls in the school were also very brave. Logan tells her to get lost, and that she only cared about whether or not a guy had a nice face. Zoe yells out loud that she liked "the piggy", and that makes Logan release Daniel. He looks at Zoe and tells her that she was crazy and leaves. He doesn't believe that she would like Daniel in his original body.
[

]
After the incident, Logan can't stop thinking about Zoe. He decides that if he confesses, she would return his feelings because he was more attractive than back then. When he turns the corner, he overhears Zoe saying that she was lying about liking Daniel's first body, which was a lie. However, he believes it and changes his mind about confessing. He cries on the bench instead and chooses to miss school.
He misses school for a month and only returns when Jay-gal calls him. He lost a considerable amount of weight and looks handsome according to the girls.
[

]
Logan enters the comics classroom, and a few girls watch him go in. After class, he thinks that people used to look at him in disgust, but now they looked at him in fondness. He goes behind a wall to smoke. The girls who were watching him catch up to him and ask him for a cigar. He tells them to leave him alone and they swoon, thinking he's playing hard to get. He gets extremely confused by their flirting.
He goes into the bathroom to examine himself. He says the carp tattoo on his arm changed into an anchovy and the buddha on his stomach into a gandhi. Two guys make fun of him, but instantly apologize after he glares at them. The two guys don't recognize him anymore. He thinks that his world had completely changed, even though he didn't act differently he was treated differently. Logan thinks that he could now confess to Zoe because he became handsome.
He doesn't see her, but he sees Mira. He drapes his arm around her because he thinks she'd like him, but Zack throws a bottle of Coke at him.
[

]
Zack no longer recognizes him. Logan starts by tackling Zack in the same hold, and happily thinks that he has gotten much faster because he is so light. However, he is unable to lift Zack up anymore so Zack punches him in the jaw and he is much more strongly affected than before. His fighting style no longer suited his new figure.
He uncounters Jin Vin in the hall who also doesn't remember him and gets knocked out. When he wakes up, Vasco, who doesn't remember him either tries to help him up.Logan threatens him and Vasco sighs. He walks away with Jace when his help is refused. Jay-gal says that Logan no longer looks like a master. They fight, and Logan struggles to beat Jay-gal, although he could usually win without effort.
He continues to try to find Zoe, but a classmate says she is sick. He peers inside a classroom and sees a familiar head, mistaking Crystal for Daniel's original body. He says "Pikachu" out loud. Logan walks up to Crystal, and only then does he realize that it is not Daniel. She insults him, and he lifts his hand up to slap her, but is grabbed by Daniel.
[
8
]
This starts a fight between Daniel and Logan. Daniel dodges every punch that Logan throws. He uses a "body blow", taught indirectly by Logan to beat him. Logan is left on the ground as Daniel leads Crystal away.
Zoe finally appears at school and she helps him up. He asks for her number and she gives it to him. Zoe thinks that he is extremely handsome. They go out for juice, and Logan asks her out, but she declines. She says it's because she hated his personality. She then leaves because she sees Daniel's original body. Logan passes out from shame.
He returns to school bigger and more violent than before. He no longer values being handsome.

Daniel Park Arc
A group of God Dogs see him and asks him if he knew of the Burn Knuckles. Zoe seems him afterwards and puts a pink band-aid on his knuckles when she sees that they are bleeding. Zoe somehow still does not remember him. He then remembers how she said she liked Daniel's original body, and that leads him to the conclusion that Zoe liked him because she liked pigs.
He passes by an alley of beat up people. He picks one up and asks the person whether he's handsome or ugly, and gets inconclusive results.
Logan tries to find Zoe. He sees her at the convenience store that Daniel worked in and looms over the window threateningly.
[
10
]
He is surprised to see his past slave. He drags Daniel into an alley and beat him. He asks if Daniel had slept with Zoe, and Daniel says that he wasn't dating her. Logan then takes out his phone and tells Daniel to give him Zoe's number. When Daniel refuses, he is beat up more by Logan. Zoe sees them and throws her shoe at Logan. She defends Daniel, and Logan walks away in defeat.
However, he goes back to the store at night and beats Daniel and takes his phone. He finds Zoe's number in it. Using Daniel's phone, he lures Zoe to a playground. He continues using Daniel's phone to text Zoe. The next day, he tells Daniel to get Zoe to the rodeo. That night, he wears fresh clothes and has a bouquet of red flowers. Someone taps him on the back and he thinks that it's Zoe, but it's the same group of God Dogs from before.
Logan ends up fighting again against the God Dogs.

—Luah Lim  in
episode TBA
Luah
Lim
is a member of
Big Deal
.
Appearance
Luah Lim is a slender girl with fair skin and long hair. Her hair is straight and falls to her mid-back. It is mostly soft black in colour, with the underside of it and a few strands being paler. A section of her bangs on her left side, in particular, consists of these pale strands.
Her features are proportionate and in accordance with the golden ratio. She has an oval face that narrows into a pointed chin, and large eyes that are a luminous purplish-brown. They are ringed by black lashes, and above them are her eyebrows, which are straight and dark.
Personality
Capable and well-informed, Luah Lim is a valued member of
Big Deal
for her intelligence gathering. She is skilled at what she does, having been the principle cause behind
Gun
's praise of the gang's ability to collect information. She also possesses the capacity to apply the knowledge which she gleans to real-world scenarios, correctly identifying
Johan Seong
from little more than his "baby face"
[
1
]
and "aura of strength."
However, Luah demonstrates a certain degree of impulsive behavior. She physically intervenes to save
Eden
despite lacking the power to effectively fight off the dog's tormentors
[
2
]
, and flings Johan's phone into a body of water to prevent him from answering a call from the
White Tiger Job Centre
[
3
]
. Both of these actions serve to reveal other aspects of her personality as well. By endeavoring to rescue Eden, she proves that she is a compassionate individual; and her throwing Johan's phone so recklessly speaks to her loyalty to Big Deal, having been instructed by
Jason Yoon
to "do whatever it takes to stop Johan from taking White Tiger's call
[
4
]
.
Luah has described herself as a "romantic"
[
5
]
and has been similarly characterized as such by Jason and Jake. She is devoted to the street which Big Deal protects, and will accomplish whatever task she must to ensure its continued safety. Due to these specific traits of hers, the idea that Luah is "like a female version of Sinu Han"
[
6
]
has been expressed.
Relationships
Big Deal
Jake Kim
Jake Kim, being the head of Big Deal, is Luah's leader. He is protective of her, perhaps overly so; for in his protection of her, he fails to consider what she wants. Jake orders Luah to leave prior to the war between
Big Deal
and
Workers
[
7
]
without even informing her of his plan, though she had voiced open concern at his supposed lack of one on multiple occasions.
Luah herself appears to regard and interact with Jake almost as she would an equal, vocalizing her intention to sit on him and the four other members of Big Deal whose ranks precede hers as punishment for not realizing she would arrive in Gangbuk instead of Gangseo, and for him not subsequently travelling to Gangbuk with those members to collect her

--- FILE: Mary_Kim.txt ---
Mary Kim (김미루
Kim Mi-roo
)
is a student in the Vocal and Dance Department of
J High School
.
Appearance
Mary Kim is extremely beautiful and tall for the average Korean woman. Having the height of 165 cm, she is taller than
Mira Kim
and
Crystal Choi
. Her complexity shows that she has pale skin, dark blue eyes, and an hour-glass figure. Her hair is bleached blonde and is later permed.
She typically wears stylish outfits, mainly wearing a black hoodie with a skirt. She tends to always be wearing a patterned bandanna. Occasionally, she sports a black snapback.
In the past, Mary's physique was different, being having a muscular with a noticed fatness, and having short hair. It is confirmed that she got surgery to gain her new appearance, which Vin always teases her with her past physique.
Personality
Mary Kim has a laid-back yet honest personality and hasn't been seen as the type to easily stress or get frustrated about something. For a considerate amount of the chapters that she is involved in, she is set off as a character who just remarks what
Vin Jin
says.
However, after the Hostel Arc is completed she is shown to be very outgoing and playful. She is seen fooling around with many of her past friends but may be seen as frightening in their eyes. In addition to this, she has great leadership qualities, as she takes a stance in leading her class to give ideas for the school festival, and even leads a Judo team in her hometown, Cheonliang.
[
2
]
Due to her past weight and insecurities, she is easily irked when referred to as 'fat' or 'thick.'
She is described by Jace as a reformed model student.
History
Mary Kim was a 15-year-old Judo genius and an undefeated middle school league legend.
Described by Vin Jin as a human weapon that every coach and manager wanted, she won gold medals in every competition she joined. Mary was nicknamed "Empress of Two Seconds," for one second to grab and another to turn over and throw down her opponent. Vin Jin reminisced that he could not ever defeat Mary back then in their Judo days.
The following year, at the age of sixteen, she lost 40 kilos, becoming the person she is now.
[
3
]
The reason for her rapid weight loss remained , possibly a new fitness lifestyle.
Relationships
Vin Jin
Although Vin Jin is generally an arrogant bully, he is shown to have a soft side for Mary. They are childhood friends who have each other's backs and are consistently treating each other like siblings. Vin Jin tends to cover his care with his obnoxious foolery, yet he will do anything to make her happy.
Jace Park
Much to his annoyance, Mary enjoys squeezing Jace's ears. She flirts, claiming that they are soft, small, and squishy to touch. However, he keeps rejecting all her attempts of flirting.
MC Pesticides
The two were both from Cheongliang and appear to have history with one another. MC Pesticides ran away after seeing Mary causing a member from the Cheongliang gang to comment that he must be feeling guilty.
[
4
]
Vin Jin tells MC Pesticides that he needs to apologize to Mary implying that there was an event that happened between Mary and MC Pesticides.
[
5
]
Mary had a crush on him when younger but he bluntly and harshly insulted her looks and body as the cause.
Parents
Her parents are yet to be shown, but they are said to be believers in Cheonliang's shaman, preventing her from gaining more fame.
Fighting Prowess
Mary Kim's style of fighting is known as the martial art
Judo
, known for using leverage and holding to throw an opponent onto the ground. Hence her nickname,
"Empress of Two Seconds,"
she is very skilled in taking down her opponents legitimately two seconds: one to grab and the other second, to pull them down. She can take down many opponents at once with no struggle,
[
6
]
which is why she is believed to have superhuman strength.
Vin Jin, who had defeated former God Dog's OB and fought Vasco in equal footing, stated that he had never defeated Mary in Judo.
[
4
]
MC Pesticides, who is a national Korean wrestling champion and is shown to lift crazily heavy objects, runs away with fear whenever he sees Mary, commenting that she has monstrous strength.
Quotes
Trivia
Mary quit riding motorbikes.
[
2
]
She leads the Cheonliang Judo team.
[
2
]
She jokes that her nickname, "Empress of Two Seconds," means that she can bring down a man in two seconds.
[
7
]
Zoe has referred to her as "Sensei-Mary."
[
7
]
Sensei is a Japanese term, literally meaning "one who comes before". It's most commonly used for a teacher, especially in martial arts like karate or judo.
In a tumblr account, it was found out later that Mary's hat has Jean-Michel Basquiat's name on it.
She hates being called fat, which Vin doesn't care, and still calls her that when he teases her.

“
People are so funny. I'm just fast yet they say i surpassed Mastery or whatever.
”
— James Lee about Mastery,
Ep. 491
Mastery
, a type of Awakening a fighter has during training, or during battle, is a sign of their exponential growth in that specific area. So far, there are 3 known stages of Mastery and 4 fields of them. Some characters do not possess any types of Mastery at all, but still are comparable to top-tier fighters. When a fighter has surpassed Mastery, their eyes glow in the respective color with respect to their Mastery.
Stages of Mastery
Path
To achieve Mastery, the fighter needs to push his body to its limits for a short period of time, to the point of "forgetting who you are", thus becoming completely miserable with himself. After that, the fighter must find and challenge someone who is on another level, so that they feel completely powerless against them, in a sensation similar to "facing a wall".
Surpassing The Wall
Only after the stages of the "Path", the fighter will have to look at this challenge and rise against this situation, thus reaching a stage known as the "Stage to Mastery", or also known as "Overcoming the Wall". During this stage, the fighter begins to grow frighteningly quickly during the fight against the powerful opponent, thus reaching Mastery.
Achieving Mastery
After these arduous stages, the fighter reaches Mastery, when reaching a Mastery, the feeling is as if he had accomplished something in an area of ​​fighting, thus reaching the "threshold" corresponding to its main aspects. For example, Hudson Ahn achieved Strength mastery because he trained his right fist nonstop, and Seongji Yuk tapped into Speed mastery because he believed in his physical abilities.
Fields of Mastery
As previously stated, Mastery has several fields one can specialize in, of which we have seen five. These fields are visually represented by a colored glow in the eyes and/or colored "effects" in the blows delivered corresponding to the type of Mastery. These types of Mastery can be combined with one another, for example when James Lee fought Seongji Yuk in chapter 491 some of his attacks were purple, which could possibly be a combination of the threshold of speed and technique.
Strength
Taesoo Ma using his Strength to land a attack on James Lee
Being represented by the color red, Mastery of strength is used by powerful fighters, those who have surpassed Mastery in strength have superhuman physical power, being able to demolish walls, carry steel bars and perform other related feats with certain ease.
In a fight, those who have superior strength can break their opponents' defense and pressure them with their physical power.
Speed
Gongseop Ji using his Speed ​​to catch up James Lee
Being represented by the color blue, the Mastery of speed is used by agile and even unreachable fighters, those who surpassed in speed are extremely fast, being able to cover long distances in seconds, dodge deadly blows and perform related feats with certain ease, in addition being one of the requirements to achieve Invisible Strike.
In a fight, those who have overcome the speed threshold are able to land several consecutive blows in a fight, being highly evasive and being able to even confuse their opponent with their speed.
Durability
Seongji Yuk using his durability to protect himself from dangerous attacks
Being represented by the color green, the Mastery of durabilty is used by highly physically durability fighters, those who have overcome resistence can last much longer during a fight, as well as even nullifying its damage.
In a fight, those who have overcome their own durability are able to hardening their muscles abnormally, in addition to nullify the pressure of various attacks.
Technqiue
James Lee parrying an powerful attack with his Technique
Being represented by the color light pink, the Mastery of the technique is used for the smartest and most skilled fighters, those who have surpassed their own technique are capable of thinking extremely quickly, thus inventing their own movements and special techniques during the fight, also achieving perform dangerous and complex actions with ease, as well as being one of the requirements to achieve Invisible Attacks.
In a fight, those who have this level of technique are able to put together tactics and create essential blows to pave the way for victory.
Conviction
Jinrang striking Kitae Kim using his Overcome Mastery
Represented by the color purple, Conviction is the Mastery stemming from filling one's attacks with the desire to protect. It has also been implied to carry the ability to block invisible attacks, as demonstrated by Jake Kim during the
Workers (2nd Affiliate)
arc. According to Gapryong Kim, this mastery allows the holder to exercise power beyond their own limits, being able to surpass other Masteries, however, if this power is allowed to stand out too much, it takes a high toll on the user's body.
Notable users include Gapryong Kim, Jake Kim, Jinrang and Dayoung Oh (formerly).

Derrick Jo
Warren Chae
Fighting Prowess
While not very powerful on their own Max and Derrick were described as Warren to be a 10/10 in terms of fighting capability. Their main strength is their ability to fight as one while supporting others through combo moves. They are so skilled in fact that they defeated Gangdog's, Mighty Warren Chae and were described by Gun as being equal to Johan Seong. It also could be said that they're equal to Hostel A's Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak given Olly's need to create his own Hostel.
Synopsis
History
Max and Derrick grew up in the same orphanage as Warren. Max was abondened in a clothes bin as a baby on a rainy day in a dog cage by his parents, he got his name from the tag that was on the dog cage. He seems to apreciate that his parents gave him a name. Ten years later they met
Warren Chae
as he entered.
The three of them went to the same middle school and gained a reputation for their fighting skills. When Sally Park allowed Warren to stay in her home, they followed him.
The two of them are known for their fighting skills. Gun compared them to Johan Seong in terms of skill. Even Warren could never beat Max and Derrick together, although alone they are not that much. They got matching tattoos in Hostel, unlike the other members, to signify their strong bond.
When Eli Jang left Hostel, Max and Derrick left to earn money to support them. They returned in episode 278, called by Sally Park, to fight Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak, defeating the duo. Ever since, Max and Derrick have remained with Hostel.

How many times must one fight and lose to become invincible?
"
—Minsik Choi to Gapryong Kim  in
episode 380
Minsik Choi is a minor character in Lookism.
Appearance
He appears to be a tall bulky man of unknown age, with a large square-ish head and many wrinkles upon his forehead. His black hair is slicked back, and he wears large square glasses.
He also wears a golden grill on his teeth.
Personality
Though he appears quite polite and courteous at first, an impression reinforced by the scenes of his youth, when tasked with the quest of laying his hands on Sally Park, he disregards her lack of consent and makes a perverted and ominous comment towards her, indicating a hidden perverted nature.
Relationships
Gapryong Fist
Tom Lee
Aside from the fact that they were both members of Gapryong's Fist in the past, Tom seems to hold some affection for Minsik, cheering him on as a spectator and even referring to him as his "Adorable Minsik".
Synopsis
History
Minsik was a member of Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang, however was kicked out and threatened by its second-in-command to leave Korea. He travelled to the Phillipines and became a businessman, however after presumably being drugged during a boat trip, he is brought to the 2nd Affiliate as a participant in The Circus.
Workers (2nd Affiliate)
He showed impressive performance in the circus with his excellent physical ability, but he is defeated by Warren Chae.
Fighting Prowess
Minsik Choi fought head on with no difficulty against Warren Chae and was defeating him easily while talking trash the whole time and only lost once Warren 'awakened' and used CQC (an extremely formidable fighting style taught by Manager Kim to him). A funny thing that indicated his pain tolerance is that he got kneed in the balls by a Sophia trained Daniel Park and an onslaught of attacks of a Manager Kim trained Warren Chae (pre awakening) with little to no damage and smiled and laughed in his face.
Minsik is/was the weakest member of the pre Generation and way past his prime.

“
Zack, do you know about the boy who cried wolf? He spoke the truth in the end, but no one believed him. You can't judge people so easily.
”
Mira Kim
(김미진 Kim Mi Jin)
is a character in
Lookism
. She is a student in the fashion department of
Jae Won High School
, as well as
Zack Lee
's love interest and one of
Daniel
's friends.
Appearance
Mira is a teenage girl who is considered to be really beautiful and sexy by many of the other characters. She has auburn colored hair with a fringe, coupled with large, dark eyes. Mira has a slim figure, a lower than average stature, and pale skin.
In many chapters, she is shown wearing her school uniform; but when she is not wearing her school uniform, she tends to wear nice and fashionable clothes, which sometimes tend to be pink.
Mira used to wear her hair in two braids in the earlier chapters but later changed her signature hairstyle into a bun.
Personality
She dislikes fighting and believes there are better ways to solve problems. As she gets upset when Zack gets into fights, she is part of the reason why Zack has stopped acting aggressively.
She is kind, caring and helpful. She is also very observant, as can be seen when she noticed that Zack was getting repeatedly upset in the Sports Day as he could not beat Daniel in any of the events. She enjoys studying in the library.
Mira is also very innocent and someone who does not judge people quickly. She has a habit of repeatedly giving people chances, which is shown when she still trusted
Jasmine Huh
even after she framed
Vasco
.
History
Fighting Prowess
Mira has experience with boxing as a child, and was the inspiration for Zack Lee to learn how to fight. She eventually quit boxing and has not been seen using these skills in the series.
Quotes

Relationships

J High School
Zack Lee
It has been revealed that Zack has a crush on her. She seems to be neutral, or even accepting of this, but still acts very shy about it. Zack and Mira care about each other a lot and often spend time with each other. Mira dislikes when Zack fights in public or makes a scene, often pulling him away from the conflict and scolding him for it later.
When the two of them go to the library together later, Zack promises not to fight that day, but ends up getting into a conflict with a group of bullies at the library who decide to pick on him and eat the Honey BBQ chips Zack brought to give to Mira, which are her favorite. He lets it go at the insistence of Mira, but ends up fighting the leader of the group when he gropes Mira.
Mira is a little upset that Zack didn't keep his promise, but later that night in a text she hints that she is happy he defended and protected her and that she forgives him.
Daniel Park
When Daniel first met her in his original body, he thought she was flirting with him when she smiles at him. Actually, she was only trying to apologize for Zack's aggressive behaviour. She is friendly with Daniel in his new body, and is part of the friend group that he hangs out with.
Jasmine Huh
Mira gave Jasmine another chance and is very friendly with her, despite of the fact that she framed Vasco. She tries to help her whenever she can and she is not aware that Jasmine actually uses her and her friendship.
Friend
Johan Seong
Johan is Mira's and Zack's childhood friend. She and Johan attended the same church. Johan also has a crush on Mira. They were tight friends. Mira was upset when Johan slowly distanced himself away from her. She tried to make up for it by visiting his mother and his salon. She also prayed and hoped that they would continue to be close friends.

Background
Zack Lee
,
Johan Seong
and Mira had known each other since they were little. The two boys had been in love with her ever since they were young, but Mira never seemed to directly reciprocate.
Mira had met Johan in a church she used to attend regularly and thus they became friends. She is still somewhat religious, as she prayed before a meal during lunch.
[

]
She seems to come from a well off family.
Exposition
Chapter 2
Mira meets Daniel on the streets after Daniel in his original body, had just gotten a haircut. Daniel thought his haircut had made him very handsome, but he just looked like Kim Jong-un. When Daniel finds Mira looking at him, he thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her.
Zack sees Daniel smile at Mira and thinks he's propositioning her. He confronts Daniel, and may have gotten into a fight if Mira had not steered him away, telling him not to act aggressively in public. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behaviour. Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders took pictures and uploaded them online.

On the first day of school, bullies are forcing Jiho to fan a magazine up and down because of the heat. When an unattractive girl tells them to stop because she was getting cold, the bullies laugh at her. However, when Mira asks them to stop, the bullies stop immediately.
Chapter 5
When Zack goes to the convenience store where Daniel works at night, he is upset because he thinks Mira is attracted to Daniel in his new body. It was also revealed that Chapter 2 was Zack's date with Mira. Moreover, Zack had asked Mira out, but she had refused. Zack was so mad that he beat Daniel in his original body up.
Chapter 6
When Zack's friends show off the picture of Daniel and compliment Zack's speed, Zack tells them that he isn't proud of hitting Daniel even though he actually wants them to speak up louder so Mira would hear. He thinks that Mira would think he is cool for being very strong. Instead, Mira says that he hates the way Zack fights all the time. She explains that in Chapter 2 Zack had invited her to the movies only to get into a fight (with Daniel). The girl chatting with Mira tells her that Zack used to be a rising boxer in middle school.
When Zack's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jae Yeol, Zack's friends, Mira, and Ha Neul look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.
Ghost Lady
Mira had forgotten her cell phone, and Zack was accompanying her to school to retrieve it when they bumped into Vasco and Bum Jae, scaring Mira. When Zack asks what's so scary about coming to school, Mira tells him of the story of the Ghost Lady, who prowls through the school on rainy days in search of her lost children. It turns out that Vasco was there to find the Ghost Lady because he wanted her to grant him a wish that people wouldn't call him stupid anymore.
Zack, trying to look cool in front of Mira, makes fun of Vasco's superstition, only for Bum Jae to dare him to sign his name on the glass frame surrounding the portrait. Mira, Bum Jae and Vasco waits for him in the classroom. When he returns, he tries to look brave in front of Mira. The next morning, Mira, Daniel, Vasco and Jace go to check out the signature only to find it on the window instead of on the portrait. Zack faints and wets his pants. In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.
Zack's Babysitting Diaries
Zack dresses up to meet Mira. When Mira greets him, she is holding a kid and Zack is horrified because he thinks that the kid is Mira's. Mira smacks him and tells Zack that the kid wasn't hers, and she just found the kid alone. She said the kid must've gotten lost. She and Zack take the kid to the police.
The police station is closed for an emergency dispatch. Mira tells Zack they have to split up so that Mira can take the subway to get to the police while Zack should wait at the cafe in case the kid's parents show up. Zack ends up taking the kid instead, growing attached to her. He names the kid "Zami" as a ship name for Zack and Mira.
Zack lets the kid walk on her own and the kid walks out the train without Zack. Zack frantically looks for her at the next stop, but he can't find her and panics.
[

]
Mira thankfully happens to find the girl on her way to Zack.
They walk through the city and it is about sunset. Zack leans over and brushes the hair out of Mira's eyes and Mira smiles at him. Two guys start exit a building, speaking curse words and smoking. Zack covers Mira's nose with his hands and tells her not to breathe in the smoke. He also tells her not to look at the trash on the ground, laugh too much, and attempts to protect her from the wind. Mira is exasperated by the treatment.
Zack and Mira eat before they enter the police station. They deliver the kid over to a cop and Mira sweatdrops over Zack's happiness when he hears the kid call him "papa."

Mitsuki Soma
(
相馬美月 Sōma Midzuki
)
also known as Neko is the CEO of the 2nd Worker Affiliate.
Appearance
Neko has a mole under her eye, fair light skin, a slender yet fit body and has long hair with the sides cut short.
Personality
Neko tends to be possessive with things she loves especially with Sinu Han whom she has feelings for. She loves the feeling of power and loves to give threatening glares to people who oppose her.
She believes that all men are disgusting, thanks to her father failing to uphold his business because of his lack of sexual discipline. Later, it was shown that he missed Mitsuki’s mother's anniversary of passing due to the same reason, causing Mitsuki to reinforce this belief. Mitsuki is shown to be extremely twisted, often taking pleasure in manipulating Sinu Han to fight for her.

Synopsis
History
Mitsuki's Full name is Mitsuki Soma. She is from a Family who runs a Pachinko place for people who depend on their luck to change,
Lucky
is the name of their Family Business.
Lucky
almost got bankrupt because of her father who is Skirt Chasing, with Mitsuki taking over the
Lucky
Business booming in all over Japan, but she said about Sacrifice in Chapter 389 for her business to boom.
Past
In Mitsuki’s flashback, she was the hostess of a casino after taking her father’s legacy, who was an irresponsible man which made her despise him. Soon then, Vivi introduced her to Eugene and brought her to the 3rd affiliate, where it was still built for the underground fight club.
When Eugene escorted Mitsuki into the building, he showed her the arena where there was a brawl going on, and that was where she met Sinu for the first time. Eugene explained Sinu’s past after Mitsuki questioned about him, and she began to like him due to his ideal personality which was completely different from her father’s.
Not so long after, Mitsuki wanted to take Sinu with her, but Eugene refused because he belonged to Workers, which made her displeased. Eugene suddenly offered her a position as the head of the affiliate, and he would allow her to work with Sinu as in return, which she agreed eventually.
Someday, Mitsuki got worried and ran to Sinu after the show, but he turned her down because he’s not interested in her, saying he only followed her orders for the sake of his friends in Gangseo. Thus, she broke down in tears and demanded Eugene to brainwash him, so he came up with an idea of making a room that looks similar to the stores in Big Deal’s area.
When Mitsuki woke Sinu up, he found himself laying on her lap inside the room, and she manipulated him by telling him there was an incident that killed all of his friends including Jake Kim and proclaimed herself as Yeonhee.

He has been shown to only wear a pair of blue shorts with a red strip of fabric, presumably the one his wife would tie her hair with, around his waist. His face is covered in a black shadow, with his left eye emitting a white glow, similar to when
Vin Jin
hid his polycoria.
It's possible that his son's polycoria was inherited from Mujin.

He is said to have lived his entire life in the wild.
Relationships

Hangyeoul Baek (백한결)
is
Gyeoul Baek
's older brother and a minor antagonist in Lookism.
Appearance
Prior to undergoing experimentation, Hangyeoul was a tall, handsome man who resembled his brother, Gyeoul, enough for the latter to assume his identity.
In the present day, his body is taller and more muscular. He is always half-naked and wearing a mask that partially covers his features. Several lines of uniform stitching cover his body in a patchwork pattern, suggesting heavy experimentation.
After being injected by his brother, Gyeoul, his skin takes on a red hue as his veins begin to bulge, particularly across his face, even causing his mask to split into shreds from sheer exertion.
Personality
In the present day, he doesn't seem to have any personality, only acting in a bestial manner due to experimentation. He has lost his memories and can no longer tell friend from foe while fighting.
Prior to undergoing experimentation, he was a genuine and kind man, as well as an outstanding plastic surgeon who put people before money. Rather than taking patients who pursued superficial beauty, he only operated on patients who sustained injuries from accidents, even if it meant suffering financial loss. He also willingly volunteered to be the sole member on the staff of his father's Doctors for the Homeless program, where he endured horrible conditions to help the less fortunate.
This kindness would be so intense that it led him to sacrifice his life in an attempt to save a few crippled men from death when the program's site began to fall apart.
Relationships
Gyeoul Baek
Hangyeoul was a staunch supporter of his brother, standing behind him when he rejected his father's standards of beauty. The younger brother saw him as a pathetic man in return, though he would realize he was fond of his older brother only after the accident. Gyeoul would use his brother's words of support to justify his experimentation on him, as he wanted him to become a force that could protect his kingdom.
Synopsis
The original Hangyeoul Baek, he worked as a plastic surgeon at the Grimm Plastic Surgery Clinic, and at his father's Doctors for the Homeless Program. After the cut corners of the latter caused him to be injured gravely, he was resuscitated by Jinyoung Park as his brother stole his identity.
At some point, he participated in the Circus and became the leader, continuously winning fights to the death, at least before the arrival of
Sinu Han
.
Fighting Prowess
His fighting power was intended to be on par with Tom Lee's. He easily defeated Jihan Kwak, Jibeom Kwak, and Hudson Ahn.
However, it is confirmed that the comparison to Tom Lee was a heavy overstatement as when he lost to the combined efforts of Samuel, Johan, Jake, and Eli (No.1 couldn't even get a hit in as they were dodging and redirecting attacks as because they stated that if they got hit once they would be knocked out, and when Eli fought him in the basement, Eli said that he got lucky because of the terrain as he could hide within it and hit Hangyeoul without getting hit back, which shocked Jake as with how damaged Eli was without even getting hit),
Gyeoul Baek
used a drug that awoke him and got him stronger and Gyeoul stated that the drug could make Hangyeoul infinitely stronger to get to the level of Tom Lee which got Johan questioning about the fact that he will continue to get stronger and stronger to until he reaches that Tom's level.

—Old Face  in
episode TBA
Old Face(
노안
Noan)
is a member of the
Workers
, and a former members of
Big Deal
.
Appearance
Old Face is estimated to stand at 6'3", with a gray buzzcut. As his nickname suggests, he has a wrinkly face which makes him look much older than his age. This is also commented upon by peers. When he is introduced in the
Eli Jang Arc
[
3
]
and
Jake Kim Arc
, he is shown to be wearing Big Deal clothing, which consists of a black blazer, with black trousers, and a white collared shirt. This never gave an indication to what his figure looked like, but later he is revealed to be lean and toned with muscles upon his shoulders, arms, and bares a six pack.
[
4
]
Personality
Old Face, back in the Jake Kim Arc, was shown to be ruthless and two faced. He did have a sense of loyalty to Big Deal, however he also had a sense of disloyalty as well due to the fact that he was never truly loyal to Sinu Han's ideology, but he would always follow Sinu Han's orders and do every one of his tasks that were given. We know his sense of loyalty to Sinu Han was not all false as he respected Sinu Han for his strength and acknowledged him as Big Deal's Big Boss, at the time of the Jake Kim Arc, and stood up to Goo, well was about to, until Sinu Hand had told him not to get involved, which Old Face respected and stood down.
Based on the type of people that Old Face chooses, and from what we have seen of him as a character and how he rose to the position that he was in Big Deal, it is very clear that he prefers those with power, influence and money, e.g. Samuel Seo, which is just like himself. When Sinu Han had planned his final act and had told Old Face that he was going to give up his ideology and sell Big Deal to workers this hit home to Old Face due to the fact that, 1, Sinu giving up on the ideology meant money finally coming to him, which shows his greed and, 2, being sold to Workers meant that they would gain money and, he himself, would climb his way within Workers and gain power, which also comes with influence as well.
In summary Old Face is loyal/unloyal, greedy, and wants to gain power one way or another no matter what he has to do.

—Olly Wang grooming
Eli Jang
in
episode
Ep. 266
Olly Wang (왕오춘 Wang O-Chun)
was a supporting character and antagonist in
Lookism
. He was the head of Hostel A.
Appearance
Olly was a extremely tall and muscular young man with sunken black eyes, black dreadlocks kept with a salmon pink headband, a white shirt under a dark brown coat with beige fur, black pants and black shoes. He had a tattoo of a compass under his right eye, he also have tattoos on his abdomen, which consists in a Eastern Dragon accompained by a flower.
In his school days, he has short and neat hair, a grayish-blue shirt with a navy blue tie and a brown backpack.
Personality
Olly was a reckless young man with a obsession for dangerous activities. His first appearance was leaping off a smash building and landing on
James'
car. Despite his craziness, Olly was a very intelligent character and impressed
Gun Park
with his business skills the first time they met.
Jin Jang
also decided to work with Olly because he was one of the smartest heads of the crews.
[
2
]
This was further supported by the fact that Olly not only saw through Jin Jang's plans and predicted Jang's betrayal but allowed it to happen in order to get Jin Jang to create a distraction, allowing Olly to have alone time with
Eli Jang
.
[
3
]
In the flashback chapters, Olly was introduced as a shy but ambitious person. Upon knowing more about Eli, he praised him and wanted to be like him, going to extreme lengths to get his attention. Many fans compare him to
Jiho Park
, as both characters sought acknowledgement and validation from their peers, but got the wrong idea of being superior. However, while Jiho was often spiteful of
Daniel
's friendship and used Daniel and
Zack
as a means to a higher status, Olly desperately wanted to be a part of Eli's friend group but was repeatedly rejected by Eli because he was not an orphan like the rest of them.
In the end, Olly desperately wanted to be accepted by Eli Jang and Hostel, because he considered them family. In
Episode 239
, he remarked that the “O” in Hostel should represent Olly himself not
Warren
. It is later revealed, despite everything, he always considered Hostel his family above anything else and worked in his own way to protect them, such as covering Hostel B's payments to Gun and making Gun promise not to hurt Eli.
His reckless behavior and choices can be attributed to the fact that he cannot feel pain or emotions. This inability to feel anything also contributed to his obsession with Eli Jang because he believes that Eli was the only one who has made him feel anything previously (this is later revealed to be false, and his guilt over his involvement in
Heather's
death is really what caused the feelings). He often made exaggerated facial expressions because he was forced to act in order to mimic emotions. Due to this, he had to practice his facial expressions.
Fighting Prowess
Not much is known about Olly's current fighting skills. He used to be weak when he was friends with Eli Jang, however he later underwent training by Gun, as head of one the four crews.
While we don't know the components of his training, we do know that Olly felt no pain and fear towards anyone. This gave him almost supernatural endurance and durability, to the point where he could even tank hits from Warren Chae, Eli Jang, and Gun with no issue. The training had also given him Aikido as one of his martial arts.
It was hinted by several characters that Olly may be one of the strongest fighters in the entire series. Jin Jang had noted that Olly Wang rarely fought others on his own, relying on the Uncles instead. He also did not put much work into his crew, instead using Hostel as a means to find Eli. Jin Jang even went so far as to say if Olly had made any serious moves he would have been the one to "dissolve the four crews into one".
[
4
]
Additionally,
Goo Kim
and Gun have noted in one of their conversations that it was ridiculous for Olly to seek out Eli if he wanted to feel fear because Olly was stronger than Eli.
[
5
]
Quotes
Trivia
Olly Wang was one of the few Chinese characters in Lookism, alongside
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
.
Olly Wang had some form of congenital analgesia allowing him to feel no pain which allowed him to grow very strong in a short amount of time under Gun's training.
Gun offered him training in a fighting style that was perfectly suited to his body and skills but he turned him down in order to become a copy of Eli and his fighting skills.
[
4
]
Jin Jang had speculated that if Olly Wang had put in as much effort into Hostel A as the other Crew Heads did, he would have been the one to unite all four crews under his control.
[
4
]
Olly Wang didn't fear Eli, just felt guilt for the reason of killing
Heather
.

Hostel
Eli Jang
Olly is obsessed with Eli and constantly seeks his attention. After the split of Hostel, he continues to look for Eli Jang and models Hostel A after his old club.
Heather
Olly had a grudge against Heather for taking away Eli's attention. He called her mother to take her away, but he did not expect the other members of Hostel to be removed as well. When Heather confided in Olly about her pregnancy, he pretended to be Eli and told her to get an abortion. Eli beat him viciously after he found out his deceit, and Olly grew even more resentful. However, it is later revealed that Olly felt tremendous guilt for causing Heather's death and regrets his actions deeply because he considered her his friend and the only one who truly understood what he was going through.

Other
Jong Gun
Gun and Olly have a working relationship. As one of the four major crew leaders, Olly works under Gun and pays a fee every month to the other man. It is suggested that Gun has some level of respect for Olly as either a crew head or fighter. He has also been shown to admire the fact that Olly cannot feel pain.

Background
Olly Wang used to go to the same cram school as Sally Park and Heather. He was a smart kid whose immigrant parents pushed him to extreme lengths to be a good student. His parents were so overbearing that he felt like he was driven to insanity.
[
1
]
Olly became obsessed with Eli Jang after witnessing him destroy Backdoor. He did anything to get Eli's attention, stealing from minors and even robbing his own house. When Gun decided to destroy Hostel, Olly advocated for them and Gun decided to let them go, on the condition that Hostel becomes one of the four crews.
As revenge against Eli, Olly decided to kill his cat
Ryan,
but he was stopped by
Jerry Kwon
. As Jerry took Ryan and left, he was then grabbed and raped by
Darius Hong
, who went to prison for his crimes. Soon later, he met with
Jong Gun
, but he was told he was too weak to run a gang.
Gun decided to train Olly, and for the next 3 years he was the new leader of Hostel A. He cut all contact with the other members of Hostel, and maintained the point system that Eli Jang created. His goal is to find Eli Jang.
Plot
Olly Wang was first introduced in the
Runaway Fam
arc as the Big Daddy of Hostel. When
Moley
brought
James Gong
to Hostel A's headquarters, Olly decided to test James for the position of Uncle.
[

]
James beat
Chuck Kwak
in a fight, so Olly accepted him as an uncle. However, he also stole Olly's cellphones, and he ordered Moley to bring him back.
On his journey to find James he ran into
Johan Seong
, who asked him to help find Gun.
[

Olly began teasing Johan, so the two began fighting until
Jin Jang
and
Jerry Kwon
interfered. Olly offered to feed Johan to get him to agree to do business with them. He promised to pay the restaurant bill for the four of them but later decided to leave Johan to pay the bill.
Jin Jang offered to help Olly find Eli Jang if Olly can help him destroy the
Burn Knuckles
. Olly agreed, and the two formed an alliance.

]
In the meantime, Olly adopted a street kid who looked remarkably similar to Eli Jang. He raised the kid to be a criminal and even named him after Eli Jang. He wanted to raise another version of Eli because he was obsessed with the original Eli.
[

]
It is revealed that Olly's obsession with Eli Jang is based on the belief that Eli Jang was the only person that allowed him to feel something (this is later revealed as false when Olly comes to the realization that his feeling was due to guilt over Heather's death).
It is revealed after his death, that Olly Wang has been covering Hostel B's payments to Gun. He also made Gun promise not to kill Eli (he made this deal knowing he would have to be dead in order for Gun to fulfill it).

Synopsis
Episode 258
The leader of the train perverts  say joe mira to swing at
Daniel
but he catches all his punches. Embarrassed, he continues to fight him until
Crystal
knocks him out. She notices that the two Daniels were present at the same time and becomes suspicious of him.
In a restaurant
Jace
is seated with the Hostel girl, and
Johan
is seated at a further table watching them. Jace is upset at the girl, but comforts her when she begins to cry. They are interrupted by
Seth Lee
, who comes to take the girl away. Jace is conflicted about whether to pursue her, because he is alone in this new town.
Jace buys Johan food and tries to convince him to help destroy the Cheongliang branch. Johan is not listening because he came to watch the news. He rejects Jace's offer because he resembles
Jin Jang
, and leaves without paying the bill. Jace is about to give up on the girl when the cashier mentions the sad state of the girls who are used by
Hostel
. Meanwhile, on the beach, Daniel and his friends are having fun and he is thankful for not having to fight.
At night Jace finally decides to pursue the girl, lamenting that he is a romantic. He has beaten some Hostel members and is cornered into an alleyway. They decide to attack him but they are beaten by Johan. Jace reveals that a while after they met at the restaurant Johan reconsidered and decided to help Jace. The terms of the agreement are written in a contract under the title "One Night", with the following conditions:
Johan will help Jace for 12 hours
Jace will pay the bill Olly left for Johan.
Jace is the leader of this mission
Episode 259
In a flashback of that day, Jace and Johan are seated in a cafe coming up with the terms to the agreement. Jace is worried about Johan agreeing to fight for him because of he looks innocent and naive but soon he finds out that Johan is a vicious fighter, smashing people into the ground and stealing their shoes. He recalls that Johan never had a right-hand man compared to other gangs, and wonders what would happen to
Burn Knuckles
if Johan hadn't been betrayed by his gang.
Jace asks a Hostel member about where the girl is and is told she is at the tea house. He tells Johan and he decides to head over and beat everyone up. Jace protests that he needs a strategy, and when Johan refuses he reminds him that he is in charge. He comes up with a diversion plan: Johan will get information from inside Hostel and he will get the information externally. Johan is annoyed but agrees, and Jace is worried if impulsiveness will be a problem.
On the beach
Zack
is frantically looking for
Mira
. He finds her but she refuses to show him her swimwear, causing him distress. Hostel A hears about Jace taking heading to the tea house, and the girl realizes Jace is coming to save her. Seth tells them not to worry, because Brett is the head of the tea house.
At the tea house Jace is disguised as a guy from the Workers looking for a girl. Brett offers him some of the girls he has and physically abuses them, pulling one by their hair. Jace tells Brett to stop and he reveals that he knows he is a member of the Burn Knuckles, and surrounds Jace with his men.
Brett becomes annoyed at the girl he is holding and tries to hit her with an ashtray, but the tray is kicked out of his hands by the other girl he sat next to, who is actually Johan in disguise. One of the men decides to sexually harass Johan, and Johan tells Jace he is done following the plan.
Episode 260
Jace tries to get Johan to calm down but the men snicker at him, causing him to snap and start attacking everyone. Jace gets the information from another Hostel member who tells him that the girl is actually at the gambling house. He is eager to tell Johan the news when he notices that Johan's hand was damaged from the fight. He remembers
Vasco
telling him a long time ago that he felt sorry for Johan because he was lonely. Jace offers Johan a bandage for his hands but Johan tosses it in the dirt, saying he doesn't need any help.
At
Jay's
beach house Zack is lighting a firecracker.
Zoe
complains and he throws a tantrum about being able to do it on his own. The sparks singe the clothes of the Cheongliang fam, who angrily ask them what they are going to do about burning their clothes. Daniel worries that they are going to finally get into a fight. Back at Hostel headquarters Seth Lee hears that Brett lost.
Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak
tell him not to worry because Jace is with Vasco, and Vasco is not as strong as Seth. They decide to meet them at the gambling house.
On the way there, Jace asks Johan how he managed to get so strong during his fights, and if he has any friends. Johan lists his dogs' names and asks Jace the same question. Jace mentions the Burn Knuckles and talks at length about Vasco and how he misses him. Johan becomes jealous of his admiration for Vasco and proceeds to show off his strength by beating the gatekeepers of the building, claiming that he is better than Vasco. Jace disagrees and calls his behavior childish. They argue until Jace is punched by Seth Lee, who asks if Johan is Vasco.
Jace is surprised at how powerful the shot was. Johan offers to help him up and Jace hands him the bandage, thinking that he, Johan and Vasco could have been good friends. He is attacked again by Seth, leaving Johan shocked. When Seth continues to confuse Johan for Vasco he puts on the bandage and copies Vasco's stance, saying he will show Seth what Vasco is really like.
Episode 261
Jace is confused as to how Johan will fight like Vasco. Seth is unimpressed by Johan and challenges him to a thumb war. He is known in his region as a thumb crusher with tremendous strength, and Johan looks fragile enough to break. However, Johan is stronger than Seth thinks, so Seth decides to fight him. Johan endures his hits and knocks him out, saying the only reason he doesn't fight like Vasco is that he doesn't his style. Jace realizes how much stronger Johan has become, and Johan commands Seth's underlings to help Jace up.
In the gambling house, the uncles are warned that Jace is on his way. They are unconcerned, as they just defeated the entire gambling house. They say that they can take anyone on with their skills, even if it is Vasco. As Jace and Johan make their way, Jace tries to warn Johan of the skills of the uncles. Johan isn't paying attention, causing Jace to be worried.
As they enter the building the men are frozen in their places, out of fear of Johan. He realizes how much he underestimated the reputation that Johan has built during his
God Dog
years. He walks the girl out of the room and into the arms of Jace. He thanks Johan and asks him to help beat up the duo, but he refuses because his contract is over. Jace wonders what Johan's true motives were as he disappears again.
The next day is the day of the meeting between the CEOs of HNH and H groups. As
the CEO of HNH group
makes his way down the road, Johan waits for him in an alley. He knows the CEO has the means to cure his mother, and Johan has all the money. He waits until the man approaches and greets him nervously.
The night before, Daniel and the others have made peace with the Cheongliang fam and they are sitting at a bonfire together. Zack mentions that their shades remind him of
Vin
, and the Cheongliang fam are suddenly alert. Elsewhere, Vin and
Mary
are reminiscing about the Cheongliang fam. Mary is excited to meet them, but Vin has a bad feeling. It is proven to be correct when the Cheongliang fam attack Daniel's friends.
Episode 262
The Cheongliang fam demand to know where Vin is, and Daniel clarifies that they are not friends. MC Pesticides is relieved to hear of it and lets go of Daniel, but MC Rice Bag continues to harass Zack. While watching them quarrel, Daniel tells MC Pesticides that his friend is in danger because Zack is a skilled boxer. He is unconcerned because his friend is also skilled, flipping Zack on his head. Zack rushes MC Rice Bag and lifts him up in an effort to prove his strength. They are both lifted by MC Pesticides, who tells Zack he will punish him. Daniel tells them to stop and then flips all three of them, surprising Jay.
MC Pesticides compares his strength to Mary, and wonders how Daniel can be so strong. Daniel is concerned that are outnumbered but then sees MC Pesticides running away, screaming about a monster. Then the remaining members of Cheongliang fam are flipped by Mary, the monster. She berates them for fighting, and when they ask if she came alone she reveals that she did not.
The next day, the two CEOs finally meet in Cheongliang. Jay's father compliments Crystal's father on how fast he is climbing up the ranks, and warns him not to get greedy. He implies that he suspects the other CEO is using children to collect money for him, and that he will expose him one day. Crystal's father realizes that the crew business is becoming dangerous for him, and is thinking of stopping it. He comes across Johan waiting for him in the alleyway.
He asks if Johan knows him and Johan stammers out his request. The CEO ignores him and turns to his men, telling them that this is the reason why the crew business was too messy and dangerous for him to continue. He tells
Goo
to take care of this mess and the latter kicks Johan's backpack, scattering his money all over the alley.
Goo tells Johan he cannot be seen with the CEO, and that he is naïve for trying to negotiate with him. Johan is enraged that Goo stepped on his money and orders him to pick him up. Goo is surprised that Johan would have the guts to challenge him, then notices that Johan's aura has changed and he looks deadlier than he used to.
Episode 263
Johan does not hesitate to attack Goo, hitting him with all he's got. Goo gets up but is knocked down again and again by Johan as he showcases skills from Vasco,
Jake
and
Gun
. Goo realizes how dangerous Johan has become when he copies Gun's punch. On his final blow Johan is shocked to see that he has missed Goo, and Goo quickly recovers. He is surprised to see that Johan missed his last shot because he looked so determined. Goo mentions that he initially wanted to be friends with Johan, but decided against it because Johan is a "momma's boy". He ends the battle by beating Johan unconscious with a stick.
Elsewhere Jace gives the hostel girl his number, and she asks him out to eat. He then spots Vasco coming towards him with the bear family he made on the road to Cheongliang. Vasco gives him the sausage bars, and proudly tells Jace of his trials getting to Cheongliang. Jace fills him in on what happened last night and Vasco apologizes for not being there, but he disagrees with Jace that Johan helped him out for the money. Instead he thinks that the reason Johan helped Jace that night was so he would have a friend for the night. As he leaves Johan in the alleyway, Goo says Johan may have a shot at beating Gun in the future.
Mary reveals that her companions are the middle school judo club who coincidentally all look the same. The men angrily ask where Vin is and she tells them that he ran back to Seoul, because he was afraid they might kill him. She asks about MC Pesticides and is told that he ran away because he was scared of her. She is a bit upset because she wanted to see him.
In the daytime MC Pesticides passes his test to join Hostel A by lifting a motorcycle with the uncles on it. He tells them he will bring the rest of Cheongliang fam along, and asks about the other uncle,
James Gong
. It turns out he is on vacation with Jasmine and the two of them stole
Olly's
bike. They are oblivious to the drama occurring within the Cheongliang branch.
In Korea's juvenile prison a rehablitation program is established by Hyunwoo Kim, a psychologist. He wants to prove that children can be changed for the better, but is disheartened when he sees the menacing looks of the inmates. He begins his evaluation with
Jiho Park
, who is there for attempted murder.
Vasco's Mini Adventures
The title cards for the One Night Arc tell the story of Vasco from the time he missed the train to when he finally arrived. The cards begin in the Hostel Branch arc and events occur in this order:
Part 1: Vasco is unconscious in the woods, and is found by a bear.
Part 2: Vasco is fed by the mother bear, who takes him into her family
Part 3: Vasco protects the bears from poachers
Part 4: Vasco meets his master
Brekdak
, who is working as a poacher
Part 5: Vasco trains in Muay Thai with his master and is spied upon by the bears
Part 6: Vasco is gifted the "golden mongkol" and leaves with the bears to find Jace
Part 7: He gives Jace the sausage bars, which are beyond rotten at this point
Notes
The style of the title cards is very similar to the
One Piece
manga's drawings of Buggy's adventures
This arc may or may not be a reference to a one-night stand

Synopsis
Episode 320
A rich Chinese girl gets high on LSD, and a cleanup crew covers her tracks to make sure she doesn't get caught in her hotel room.
Outside, Brekdak gives his stand to Vasco to make money, and Vasco sells fish sticks to his costumers. He meets a variety of people, including "Jane Kim," who is Jake in disguise. When the Chinese girl takes food, but doesn't pay the 500 won, Vasco realizes it and tries to go inside the club to get payment.
Jake, who entered the club, sees Old Face and decides to talk to him. Just then, Vasco, who is getting confronted for entering the club without the security guard's permission and is demanding payment, causes a stir and distracts everyone. This causes a fight to break out between him and some of the guards. Ho Hwang challenges Vasco to a fight.
Episode 321
DJ Chaerin notices the fight breaking out with Vasco and Ho Hwang, but decide to just crank the music because the people are enjoying it. Old Face interrupts them and tells the guards he will handle the situation, and Jake is annoyed he missed his chance to talk to him. Jake suspects that Vasco doesn't stand a chance against Old Face, but Vasco has gotten stronger and easily knocks him out. Ho Hwang congratulates Vasco's strength.
Jake takes Old Face to a bathroom and ties him up. He sticks a toilet paper roll in his mouth and threatens to pump water down his throat if he doesn't reveal Sinu Han's location. Old Face tells him that he doesn't know where Sinu is, but he knows something else thats valuable. The girl in the stroller from earlier is Vivi, the president of the third affiliate and the daughter of a Chinese billionaire. She runs Hotel Vivi and Club Vivi. She is currently in the Workers because she is a drug addict, and drugs laws are more harsh in China. Old Face also tells Jake that her bodyguard is called Xiaolong, and his loyalty and the guards' loyalty is towarsd Vivi above all else. Xiaolong is rumored to be as strong as Gun, and the other bodyguards are as strong as the crew heads. Jake decides not to interfere with Vasco's fight, because he is not strong enough to lead a crew.
Vasco is currently losing against Ho Hwang when he tells him that he has learned a lot about winning from bad guys: he has to use his most lethal move first. He grabs Hwang's face and uses two of Brekdak's forbidden moves: No. 7 (Dough Kneading) and No. 8 (Rice Bag Smash). Jake approaches Xiaolong guarding a door and asks if he can speak with him in English, knowing that Xiaolong only speaks Chinese, and will probably only fight him.
Episode 322
Xiaolong responds to Jake in Korean asking if he would step inside, and he is dissapointed he didn't get a chance to fight. When he enters the room a chicken foot is thrown at the wall by Vivi, who is angry that Xiaolong sent an unattractive guard to her. Jake realizes that they mistook him for someone else and decides to play the role, introducing himself as a member of the White Tiger Company. He fakes details about Tom Lee's life and says he thought he would have met Sinu Han during his interview, saying that the two of them are lovers. Xiaolong mentions that he is No. 8, and Vivi tells Jake that their love was not meant to be given that the numbers are kept secret. Jake tries sneezing his name and playing a song about Sinu, but they are interrupted when Johan arrives and introduces himself as the intern from White Tiger Company.
Vasco continues to fight the guards, breaking one of their legs with Brekdak's Forbidden Move No. 6. Johan recognizes Jake, and he attempts to leave but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar. Brekdak enters the club wondering what is taking Vasco so long.
Episode 323
Brekdak asks Alexander Hwang, who is now working as a valet at the third affiliate, to step aside. Other Workers members ask what is going on, and he explains that Brekdak is looking for someone. They tell Hwang they were going to report him for running a food truck without a liscence, and Brekdak backs off to save his business.
Jake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer and find more information about Sinu. Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen.
The two of them confront Vasco, and he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo. The three of them decide to fight each other.
Episode 324
Xiaolong reveals that he gave this test to Johan and Jake believing they would lose to Vasco. He does not trust the White Tiger Company, because the
chairman of the Workers
is using them to spy on the third affiliate, and he does not want any of his men in the club. Johan is fighting well using his taekwondo. Jake remembers a time he and
Jason Yoon
ate together, and Jason mentioning wanting to fight a powerful taekwondo fighter from Gangbuk, a guy whose moves resemble Johan's. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.
Johan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them, disappearing into an underground passage.
Steve Hong is impressed by Daniel's weight loss, and Sophia cries tears of joy now that Daniel has lost enough weight to go undercover.

Synopsis
Episode 360
The girls working at James Lee crew's bar come to
Jiho
to complain about the work. The bar manager bursts in and apologizes for their behavior, swearing he will teach them better. Jiho asks how many of the girls are complaining, and pulls out one tooth for each girl. They beg him to stop and say they will stop complaining about the work.
Daniel
comes to
Jace
to ask about the James Lee crew, and he tells them that he wanted to pay them back for messing with the
Burn Knuckles
. Jace says he didn't tell
Vasco
because he is obsessed with beating bad guys, so Jace will do it instead. He tells the gang that
Ansan
is running a private bar in Gangbuk where only verified customers can enter, and they used underaged girls from the runaway fams to run these bars.
Daniel goes undercover in Gangdong with
Eli
and pretend to be runaway kids. It isn't long before they are approached by
Jacky.
Zack
and Jace are pretending to be customers at a bar to get information on the illegal bar. Zack asks the girl next to him how old she is. When she says her age, Zack tells her to go get the head of the bar. Jace is excited that they will be getting more information, but Zack punches the manager and says they will take over Gangbuk like the other gangs. Jace hopes Daniel and Eli are doing better, but Eli has decided to pick a fight with Jacky.
Episode 361
Daniel
breaks them up and apologizes for
Eli's
short temper, saying they get messed with a lot as runaways.
Jacky
decides to take Daniel for an interview, and Daniel tells Eli to stay behind and cool down a bit.
Zack
beats up all the gangsters to
Jace's
surprise. They interrogate one of the bar workers and he says they don't know about the James Lee crew, only that high schoolers have been taking over bars.
Channing
enters and is surprised they beat everyone, and he asks if they want to work with them. Zack punches him and discovers Channing is a kickboxer. Channing says he will only use one hand to fight, and Zack thinks he is going to use his feet when his guard is down. Channing however uses a tattoo gun to slash Zack across the chest. Zack loses to Channing, and Jace tries to attack him but he is knocked to the ground as well.
Jacky takes Daniel to the crew's base for an interview. He knocks on the door and gets no response. When he enters,
Darius
in yoga pants doing pilates. He crawls on the ground asking for Daniel to take off his clothes, and Daniel slams the door and apologizes internally to Jace for not being able to do the interview.
Eli decides to go to the base anyway, and
DG
rolls up to tell him not to. Eli refuses, and DG asks if he wants to get in trouble.
Episode 362
Eli
smashes
DG's
helmet and tries to stab him with one of the shards. DG dodges and tells Eli he isn't looking for a fight. He whispers something to him and Eli wonders what to do.
Zack
wakes up in despair that he could not protect anyone. He sees Vasco standing over him, holding the couple's tracker. He is staring at
Jace
, who
Channing
tattoed
Ansan's
name on after stripping him to his boxers. Vasco cries tears of blood, and he remembers Jace saying extreme anger can lead to a person doing that.
Darius
sits
Daniel
on his lap for the interview and makes him feel uncomfortable with his handsiness. Daniel stands up and asks where to see the boss instead, and Darius reveals he knows who Daniel is, and that his gang had prepared for them. Daniel punches Darius and rushes to the door, but
Hudson
appears and punches him back. He asks if Hudson is from Ansan, and he admits it. Hudson's punches are powerful enough to create holes in the wall. Daniel thinks it is kyoukoshin karate, but Hudson says it is just training. With Daniel cornered, he starts whaling on him, preparing to use his right fist. Daniel hits Hudson back and steps on Darius's face to launch a kick, but Darius grabs his ankle and Hudson punches him in the stomach. Daniel is incapacitated, and Hudson leaves Darius to do what he wants to Daniel's body. He strips to his boxers and prepares to assault Daniel but Daniel gets up and punches him in the nuts.
Samuel
explains elsewhere that the heated mode that arises during fighting is caused by inferior emotions that escalate into madness.
Episode 363
Jiho
asks
Hudson
what took him so long, and he mentions having left
Daniel
to
Darius
. He also says
the King
will be approaching soon, his senior. A crew member bursts in to say Daniel is loose and attacking the second floor.
Jacky
is leaving the girls' dorm when he runs into
Zack
, looking for
Channing
. He tells Zack to not be a sorry loser and Zack decides to fight him, saying he never lost.
Warren
learns from
Max
and
Derrick
that the reason they lost is that they underestimated Jacky. He is incredibly fast and flexible, as well as powerful. Jacky tells Zack that despite being a lower rank than Channing, he is more powerful than he is.
He kicks Zack into a car and Zack wonders aloud how he could lose this easily to these gangsters when he was doing so well against
Mandeok
. Jacky tells him he isn’t talented, and he should try something other than fighting. Zack is triggered and grabs Jacky, slamming him into a car. Jacky tries to escape but he is trapped within the metal folds Zack caused when he slammed him in there. Zack starts punching him in the face as Jacky begs for mercy before he passes out. Zack is satisfied he lost against someone stronger than Channing.
Vasco
comes to the location that was tattooed on
Jace’s
body. Channing asks him if he is scared of needles, and Vasco tells him to not bother him since he is going to die soon.
Episode 364
As
Daniel
is fighting
Hudson
, Hudson recalls his call with
his senior
. He told the guy that
James Lee
may arrive in Seoul to squash the people using his name. His senior tells him not to use that name in vain, and Hudson says he is not joking. Daniel continues to slash Hudson in real time, and he says that the King of Ansan is coming, and he can’t let him see this mess. He rips off his shirt.
Channing
remembers when he used to bully people in school, tormenting his victims out of boredom. He tells
Vasco
he wants to be remembered forever as well, and slashes him with his tattoo gun. He mocks Vasco for playing crew with the
Burn Knuckles
, who are scrubs. Vasco says that he knows this, and it doesn’t matter because he will fight on their behalf. He said the same thing to the Burn Knuckles before, and
Jake
acknowledges this side of Vasco to
Lineman.
He punches Channing in the face, breaking the ground underneath him. Channing is stunned by the blow, and pulls out some more needles but Vasco keeps beating him. He wails that he was recognized by
Gun
and
Goo
three years ago, and Vasco uses
Brekdak’s
fifth forbidden move, and then a compressed low kick (his third forbidden move). Channing’s legs are crippled and Vasco tries to turn himself in, but the cop refuses.
Ethan
carries
Darius
out of the building so he and the other
Backdoor
members can guard the entrance of the hideout.
DG
arrives and asks who is using his name. Darius orders Backdoor to capture DG, and he decides fists will work better than words.
Episode 365
Darius is asked what his dream guy would be like, and he says a strong man. When asked about DG he says it isn't possible to feel lust for a god. DG complains that he isn't as strong as he used to be, and leaves after beating up everyone.
Daniel and Hudson are exchanging blows. Hudson grabs his left arm to punch Daniel but he kicks him away. Hudson has a flashback to his master at a bonfire. The king of Ansan says that he will be giving the crew to Hudson, who will be the sun of Ansan. He offers him a roasted python and Hudson accepts his position. Hudson tries to motivate himself against Daniel but he is struggling because Daniel is copying his moves. Daniel kicks Hudson out of a window and slams his face into the ground as they fall. He tells Hudson to return as friends in the future.
Daniel then sees a guy walking towards him. He asks if he is the King of Ansan. DG is also walking in that direction when he notices something.
Episode 366
The guy ignores Daniel and walks to Hudson, saying he did well and it's okay he lost. He ignores Daniel a second time and says he isn't interested in the second generation, but he came for James Lee. Daniel asks if the guy is willing to lose again, and he gets irritated.
Tom Lee narrates that there were many powerful leaders of the first generation, one of them being Taesoo Ma, king of Ansan who Daniel is currently fighting. Taesoo has the trademark of only fighting with his right fist. He is very powerful, damaging Daniel's arm and stopping his reverse kick.
Taesoo recalls his past when he fought with James Lee and lost. James acknowledged Taesoo but said it was time for the first generation of fighters to end. Since Taesoo would never stop fighting, he decided to cut his finger off. Taesoo pleaded with him to take his right eye instead. Since then, Taesoo has wanted revenge against DG, and to do the same to him.
Daniel gets back up and says he will show Taesoo how powerful the second generation can be. Vasco uses Brekdak's skill No.5 on Taesoo, and Zack punches him with chains in his hands. Taesoo is pleased with them all and tells them to come at him. Then DG comes flying from the building to kick Taesoo. He tells Daniel to go inside since there is someone waiting for him.
Episode 367
Daniel, Zack and Vasco enter the building looking for Jiho. They find a Backdoor member who says Jiho is waiting for Daniel at the place, and he wants Daniel to come as himself and not James Lee. Zack is confused and wants to come with Daniel, but Daniel says he must go alone. He goes home and dresses in his uniform in his original body.
DG is fighting Taesoo, who doesn't recognize him. Hudson wakes up and is surprised with how quiet and calculating DG is during battle. Hudson starts crying seeing his idol lose, and Taesoo remembers his loss to DG. DG leans over Taesoo and says even though he lost, he is still cool. Taesoo recognizes DG and breaks down, flinging at him wildly with both fists. Hudson and DG are shocked to see Taesoo break his own rule of only using his right fist.
Episode 368
Ever since Taesoo lost to DG, he has been training his left fist for revenge. Even though he abandoned his principle, it didn't matter if he could kill DG. Now his fist reaches DG. Hudson is shocked to see James Lee threatened by Taesoo and dodging his powerful punches. DG however tells Taesoo that he's gotten weaker, and he kicks him to the ground. Taesoo recalls DG telling him after their first fight that the reason he was so powerful was the faith he had in himself. By giving up on his values, Taesoo is weaker in DG's perspective.
Hudson sees his idol crumbling before him and starts crying. DG tells Taesoo not to bother him, and he says that it doesn't matter. The first generation know that James Lee exists, and they will come after him for their own reasons. DG says it wouldn't be a problem since the second generation isn't made of pushovers.
Daniel confronts Jiho at the convenience store and asks him if he still pretends to smoke. Jiho asks how Daniel knew the location, and he says this was the first place the two of them fought. He then tells Daniel that he asked him to come like this because he has two bodies.
Episode 369
Darius visited Jiho in prison before he left and reported what he found out about Daniel. He couldn't find any information about his family except that they lived abroad. His friend just slept the entire day. Looking into his school files he found that the fat Daniel was on the school record. Jiho asks Darius if he has ever seen the two of them together.
Back at the convenience store Jiho reassures Daniel he hasn't told anyone the truth about his identity. He asks Daniel to give him the secret of the two bodies, but Daniel refuses and tells him to turn himself in. Jiho smashes Daniel into the window and says that he should understand the most how he feels. He slams his head into the ground and tries to choke Daniel with a string but he escapes. Jiho sticks a wine opener in his chest and twists it before slashing Daniel. Jiho stands over Daniel and says they are the same person, but Daniel just got lucky.
Daniel has a flashback to a meeting with Duke. His fans came into the room and Daniel mistakenly greeted them before they asked Duke for a picture. In real time, Daniel punches Jiho into a convenience machine and tells him to stop blaming his appearance for his failures, because people can change. Jiho tells Daniel he can't change, and Wally stabs Daniel in the back but Daniel removes the knife and throws him away. Daniel then starts beating Jiho with systema. Jiho begs for Daniel to forgive him and give him another chance. Daniel helps him up before elbowing him in the head, saying that Jiho doesn't get another chance.

“
Copy is not invincible.
I can't copy the things I gained by polishing my own way, such as Gun Park's body and my gift.
That's why the pinnacle of a generation has been the pinnacle of Gapryong Kim and Lee Ji Hoon.

“
It is different from the state.
Your own way
is literally a special one that can only walk.
Unlike the state that anyone can cross, no one can realize his own way.
”
— Gun Park,
Episode 557
Path
is a unique ability that, according to
Gun Park
, is distinguished from
Mastery
because it is something unique to the individual that no one else can attain and that arises as a manifestation of their own abilities and convictions. To awaken their own Path, the individual must reach a state of understanding and unwavering determination in what they believe as proof of their individuality and thus achieve unparalleled power.
The main difference between Mastery and Path is that Mastery users acquire a superhuman physical attribute that manifests itself in the emanation of an aura and a glow in the eyes of a specific color, while Path is the awakening of a unique ability that is associated with a pure white aura emanating from the user's entire body and their eyes.
Known Paths
The Infinite Technique
Johan's Infinite Technique
Johan's Path manifests itself as a unique and advanced use of all the techniques he copied allowing him to always hit his target giving him a wide attack arc and an almost infinite variety of attack options using the right technique to break through the enemy's blockade.
Path Users
To date, only five people have been confirmed to be confirmed on this road.

to take care of the matter. He is currently in a meeting with
Crystal
and
DG
, who asks Gun if he can meet Daniel someday.
Logan begins fighting Jay, who is very fast and skilled. He realizes Jay is using Systema, a martial art he is unfamiliar with. He threatens to rip Daniel's money and Jay rushes at him. Logan grabs him by the hair and pulls him into a guillotine choke. He tells Jay to tap out but he struggles and passes out. Daniel spots Logan choking Jay and leaps in the air to fight him.
Episode 50
Logan tries to hit Daniel but he smacks his arm away. He runs towards Jay to pick him up and sees Logan towering over him. Daniel panics and is frozen in fear, but Logan decides to let them go because he is intimidated by them.
Jay wakes up a short while later when Daniel is carrying him. He explains that Logan is a local gangster and asks why Logan attacked Jay. Jay pulls out the lucky charm, and Daniel realizes Jay came with him to get it back. He cries out of shame, because he couldn't be brave even in his new body.
Daniel tries to return the shirt to the store when he discovers it is stained. The people refuse to allow him until they see Jay. They give him a new shirt and Daniel wonders if Jay used to be an employee. When he returns to his neighborhood, he asks
Vasco
to train him and decides to change. Back at the old neighborhood, Logan is back to bullying people.
Notes
Pavlov's Dog is a famous experiment in psychology; it is also the title of this arc. The idea is that a creature can become conditioned to react to a stimulus. Daniel's stimulus was Logan, and the reaction was fear.

PTJ Entertainment
is an idol training agency. Some successful stars include
DG
and
Aru
.
History
PTJ is the starting ground for many successful idols. One of the greatest idols produced was
DG
, one of the
ten geniuses
being raised by Crystal's father. Another idol who rose to fame at the agency is
Aru
, a country singer who transitioned into a pop star following her debut.
Daniel
and
Duke
were recruited into PTJ in their freshman year but Daniel has dropped out of the program following the Aru scandal. During his time there, DG was promoted to the CEO as well.
[

Organization
Classes
PTJ Entertainment has a strong heirarchy with a strong emphasis on ability. Trainees are separated into 3 classes: A, B and C.
Boys from Class A
Daniel's class, Class C, was only just created when he arrived.
[
2
]
Class A seems to be composed of more talented and senior trainees while C is composed of greener and less talented trainees.
[
3
]
Class C is the only co-ed class, whereas Classes A and B are separated into female and male groups.
[

]
PTJ Trainee Rules
Trainee rules
The training program seems to be incredibly harsh. A list of rules for trainees is seen stuck to a pane of glass.
[
2
]
Translated, it says:
Impolite, uncivilized people will be fired
There can be no incapable people here. Those who slack off will be fired
Those who smoke or drink alcohol will be laid off
Those who are late more than 3 times will be laid off
Those who have romantic affairs will be laid off
Those who do not show improvement at the end of month evaluation will be laid off
Expenses for trainees
Food expenses
One of the reasons why Daniel decided to become a trainee is because of the fact that the company gives an allowance for food expenses. A class is given 6000 won for meals whereas C class is only given 4000 won for meals. This is one of the ways the company discriminates based on trainee ability and tries to encourage hard work within the trainee community.

Trivia
PTJ Entertainment may be a fictional version of YG Entertainment, considering the fact that DG is inspired by G-Dragon, who comes from YG. There's also the fact that YG is involved with a series of scandals, and is known for illegal behavior in the Entertainment, while in PTJ, many of the idols and employees behave the same way, as shown when they blackmailed Aru with her nude pictures.

A manager from
PTJ Entertainment

Daniel
and asks him to audition at PTJ. Daniel asks if
Duke
can come along, and the man grudgingly agrees. They both audition and Duke does well, but is rejected anyway for his appearance. Daniel says he will not go unless Duke does, and Duke is accepted into PTJ.

Oliver
and
Lasol
, two other Class C trainees. They greet another trainee who enters, and Daniel recognizes her.
Episode 97
The trainee is
Joy Hong
, who he modeled with previously. Joy joined PTJ out of fun, and to see Daniel as well. The trainees go out to eat at a restaurant and Daniel finds out they are all on a budget. When the Class A kids leave their food, Daniel tries to take some and they make fun of him for it. Joy pays for everyone's food and tells them off. As he is heading home, Oliver spies a picture of the singer
Aru Lee
and sings to himself.
Daniel is heading to the agency when he meets the Class A boys and a new guy, who beckon him over.
Episode 98
The man is
Aru's manager
, who tells Daniel not to get cocky. He is waiting for Aru, and when she comes out she greets Daniel. Daniel tells Aru he is in the same class as Oliver and Lasol and she becomes cold. The Class A kids tell him not to mention their names because they have a bad relationship with Aru.
Daniel and Duke train with Oliver and Lasol in the studio. When they return to the convenience store Duke shows off his dancing skills, making Daniel proud. Daniel begins practicing at night in his second body and improves quickly. Duke becomes jealous of Daniel's fast growth. They all go to the evaluation.
Episode 99
Oliver and Lasol do well but Aru is not impressed and keeps them behind. They give Joy a pass for being young, but they are not impressed by Duke. When Daniel performs everyone is blown away, and they are interested in making him an actor.

In a piano room Oliver tells some kids off for being in a secret relationship. He has a flashback to playing piano with Aru, back when they were friends.
Episode 100
Oliver has a flashback to his relationship with Aru. Both were poor trainees struggling to make ends meet. Aru wanted to be his girlfriend but he refused because he had to focus in his career. When Aru opened up to him he started to care about her. He learned she was struggling in the agency and they started to rely on each other. Everything fell to pieces when Aru cheated on him.
Episode 101
Aru asked Oliver to sign a contract for marriage if their debuts fail. She learns that a wealthy gangster is willing to invest in a girl group at PTJ. Lasol is considered but not Aru, and she grows despondent.
Oliver is walking when he spies a man kissing Aru in the car. He races to save her and is beaten by that man's bodyguard. The man is the wealthy gangster who wanted to invest. Aru decided to be his girlfriend and in exchange he would make her a famous idol.
Aru cuts Oliver off and the bodyguard becomes her manager. The girl group is discontinued and Oliver and Lasol are stuck in Class C, where Aru intends to keep them. Oliver burns the contract and cries about his misfortune.
Episode 102
Daniel notices he is being treated better by the Class A kids than before. Aru complains to her manager that she is gaining weight, and he is resentful towards her for her selfish personality. Her boyfriend comes in and beats her manager for not taking care of her.
Daniel and the others take a photo but Duke is not invited to. As the manager leaves he hits Daniel for not bowing to Aru. Duke calls Daniel and tells him the door is locked, and he asks Daniel to bring the key. Daniel wakes up in his other body and goes to give him the key. When he gets to the door he runs into the Class A kids, who look at him in disgust.
Episode 103
Daniel notices the harsh treatment Duke receives at PTJ when he isn't around. The manager comes in to harass Duke and decides to harass Daniel as well. He makes fun of Daniel's handsome self and Duke learns that he was only allowed to join because of Daniel. He tells the manager to not insult Daniel and the manager stabs his ears with thumbtacks. Daniel passes out and wakes up in his other body.
Episode 104
The manager leaves them and tells Duke to keep quiet. Daniel calls Duke and tells him to go to the hospital but Duke refuses, saying he is okay. At school the fashion students fawn over Daniel's new job.

is worried about Joy.
Vasco
asks if he can visit Daniel's agency and he agrees. Vasco is awed at Duke's piercings, not knowing where they come from. At the agency Daniel meets DG, who is disappointed at Daniel for working in a convenience store. Daniel tries to get him to explain but he walks away. A
woman
is seen staring at Daniel blankly.
The manager is beating the trainees to release his anger. When he gets to Daniel he raises his hand to hit him. Vasco catches it and he is surprised at Vasco's strength. The man brags that he is Aru's manager, and Vasco calls himself Daniel's manager.
Episode 105
Daniel tells Vasco that the man is his superior and Vasco apologizes. The manager asks Vasco if he wants piercings like Duke and he gets triggered and beats him. The higher ups at PTJ do not report the incident because they don't want it getting out.
Aru meets with the board at PTJ and they are discussing her new film. She is mad that DG won't pay attention to her compared to the other men. DG prepares to leave early for a meeting but they ask him to stay. He invites Crystal over to PTJ so he can talk to her, and the men fawn over Crystal. They even ask her to take Aru's place.
Aru is jealous of how DG treats Crystal with kindness and favors her. She cries to her boyfriend and makes plans for revenge.
Episode 106
Aru lies to her boss that she needs a million to buy a house, and invests it in her private company. The trainees at PTJ hear that Aru is leaving and get nervous. DG,
Gun
and Crystal discuss Aru's departure and DG tells them he has bad news about Aru.
Aru and her boyfriend head over to a studio for a photoshoot and she learns it is a nude photoshoot. She attempts to leave and they tell her that she is legally contracted to do it, and if she refuses she has to pay back the one million dollars.

Overview
The
Red Paper
, specifically the one for Charles Choi, contains the details of a deal between
Charles Choi
and the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
History
During the events of the
Cheonliang Arc
, Charles met up with
Shinmyung Cheon
and asked for some land. Saying that he's enjoyed his status so far because Shinmyung himself made his own deal with the Yamazaki, of which Charles pulled out the proof for in the form of Shinmyung's "Red" Paper.
To this this, Shinmyung counters with the Red Paper. Following the death of Shinmyung Cheon, Taejin takes over Cheonliang as its leader and Charles meets up with him. After some bold words from Taejin, Charles left with a smile as Taejin didn't know about the Red Paper. Taejin is then captured by
Goo Kim
, who under the orders of Charles Choi, was also sent to find the Red Paper. With Taejin out of the picture, Charles seems to have revisited Cheonliang to burn the Red Paper, figuring where Shinmyung hid it.
In more current times,
Daniel Park
and
Vin Jin
go to look for the Red Paper in the remains of the Shaman's house. Opening the safe in the ground, they find it missing. Almost right after, henchmen attack them. After a scuffle and them being guided into a van. They meet up with
Reporter Kim
, who shows them that she has it. Charles Choi figures out that the Red Paper he burnt was a fake around the same time.
Leading into the events of
The Hunt for Gun
. The whole point of which is for Gun to obtain and deliver the Red Paper to Charles. After numerous battles. Gun is tired out, and Daniel eventually exposes the Red Paper to the press who showed up. Leading to Charles jumping off the school building and ending his life.

Jasmine
, but tries to ignore it.
Doo
and his friends are laughing at a picture of
Mira
, causing Zack to examine it closer. An online account is claiming to sell Mira's stockings for a certain amount of money, and there are other accounts doing the same with
Joy
,
Zoe
and
Mary's
pictures. They head to the police station but they are unable to do anything about it. Daniel and Zack decide to catch the scammers themselves.

Daniel meets two girls he calls
'Hilarious'
and
'Like What'
, because that is all they say. He asks the girls to take him to Hostel but they don't know what that is. He takes them out to eat and feels bad when he sees
Daniel and the girls
how hungry they are. He asks them how they earn their money and they refuse to tell him, because he is too innocent. He asks them to take him to their runaway fam, and they agree.

The girls are called out by Riley who wants to use them for 'roleplaying'. He picks the inexperienced girl to go with him and Daniel tries to come along but he is told to stay behind. The other girl cries that she isn't ready for it yet, and Daniel asks what the fuss is about. He learns that Riley employs his girls in prostitution scams to earn money.
The girl's client is in a shower attempting to wash before their meeting. He comes out to find an angry Daniel telling him to piss off. As the man tries to run he is hit by Riley, who accuses Daniel of ruining everything.

Notes
There are a lot of anti-smoking references in this arc (Daniel hitting Zack's cigarette, Johan and Olly putting out Jin's cigarettes with soup)
The
pedophile lawyer
in this arc was also seen trying to buy Mira's spit in the Jacedaichi Files arc and trying to get Jiho out of prison in the Daniel Park's Death arc.

Ryan (라이언
Lyon
)
is a stray cat that was originally owned by
Eli
and
Sally
. He was later adopted by
Jerry Kwon
.
Appearance
Although it is never explicitly stated, Ryan seems to resemble a tuxedo cat with low-grade spotting. His eye colour is inconsistent throughout the series, however it mostly remains black.
Relationships
Eli Jang
Former owner and caretaker of Ryan
Sally Park
Former owner and caretaker of Ryan
Jerry Kwon
Current owner and caretaker of Ryan
Synopsis
Profile
Ryan was
Eli Jang's
pet cat from his childhood. When Eli ran away from home, he took Ryan with him. The two of them lived together on the streets before Ryan led
Sally
to Eli, who was squatting in her house.
Nothing much is said about Ryan other than that he is a stray cat that lives with Sally, and in most parts, is the comedic relief of the story, and appears in certain situations. Sometimes it appears as though Ryan is talking, but that is because he has a habit of meowing when other people are talking.
Eli gave Ryan the final letter of Hostel, and considered him part of their family. Ryan was almost killed by
Olly Wang
, but was saved by
Jerry Kwon
, who decided to adopt the cat. He is the one who gave Jerry the scars on his face, as well as
Max
.
Fighting Prowess
Ryan has shown exceptional strength even scarring the likes of
Max Kang
and
Jerry Kwon
. As Jerry has marked a scar on
Gun Park
, it is safe to assume Ryan is on par or relative to the latter.
Quotes
“Come here, meow!”
“Meow”
Trivia
Ryan is responsible for the L in Hostel, which causes
Olly Wang
great distress contributing to his development of an inferiority complex towards the rest of Hostel.
Ryan resembles a black bicolor/tuxedo cat.

"
I am the mad dog, Kagiroi! I never let go once I bite! I will follow you wherever you go!
"
—Ryuhei Kuroda introducing himself to Neko  in
episode
392
Ryuhei Kuroda (
黒田竜平 Kuroda Ryūhei
)
also known as "Nomen" and "Kagiroi" is an executive of the 2nd Affiliate of Workers and serves as Neko's bodyguard. He is the leader of Kanto's strongest biker gang which is also named Kagiroi.
Appearance
Nomen is an attractive young man who has dyed yellow spiky hair and black eyes. He is very tall and has a slim body figure. He usually wears a black suit with an orange tie and a white coat with the sleeve that has the Japanese kanji (天上天下/てんじょうてん　げ) which means “throughout heaven and earth). Nomen's jacket is an item he has held from his past as Kagiroi's leader with the rest of his outfit being the standard Workers uniform.
Nomen's outfit whilst operating as the Kagiroi was seen to be all white with loafers, dress pants, and a button-up shirt with a red trim.
Personality
Nomen's core characteristic is his extreme drive. This drive has manifested in both his conquering of the Kanto region of Japan whilst operating as nothing more than a biker gang whilst he was contending with the Yakuza. This drive has also manifested lustfully as his extreme attraction towards Neko or Mitsuki despite her open and extreme adoration towards Sinu Han.
In either case, he displays a relaxed aura both towards his gang and whilst flirting and openly soliciting sex with Neko. This results in him being viewed as highly charismatic and intimidating by his gang and other fighters but as nothing more than obnoxious by Neko. The above leads to Nomen openly antagonising all people that make advances or seem to make advances on Neko.
However, this bellies Nomen's own genuine love for Neko. Nomen's lustful actions manifesting partially out of his prior experience of simply and easily obtaining women due to his position and charisma. Nomen is willing to lay down his own life for Neko not simply out of a mere desire for sex.
Nomen is also able to display genuine respect for others, seeing Sinu Han as a rival vying for Neko's attraction alongside himself.
Relationships
Workers 2nd Affiliation
Mitsuki Soma
She is Nomen's main love interest, though their relationship is one-sided with Mitsuki actively disliking Nomen due to their first meeting and her misandry.
Sinu Han
He is viewed by Nomen as his "rival" with Nomen antagonising him though he does respect him.
Synopsis
History
Before Nomen was a member of Workers as Mitsuki's bodyguard, he was the leader of a biker gang in the Kanto region entitled "Kagiroi". Kagiroi's presence was such that they were mythologised as a boogeyman to scare children into being quiet. Kagiroi was strong enough to conquer the Yakuza in the Kanto region even leading to them being known by Gun.
Despite this, Nomen suffered from one thing: erectile dysfunction. The cause of this was unknown to him, and caused him great distress, emasculating him and depriving him of multiple sexual encounters. However, his continual dismissal of women that wanted him appeared to his gang as him simply having a high standard for women.
Eventually, after Soma Mitsuki took over her father's business, she approached Kagiroi as a business partner and her first bodyguard. Nomen, upon seeing Mitsuki gained an erection for the first time in multiple years. Nomen immediately asked Mitsuki out to view the fireworks. Mitsuki was understandably disgusted by this, her disgust compounded by her pre-existing misandry. However, Mitsuki's disgust only increased Nomen's attraction for her leading him to vow that he would make her his woman.
Fighting Prowess
Nomen is a powerful fighter with seemingly no martial arts background. However, his fighting ability is correlated to his motivation, seemingly compounded greatly if he is in a situation wherein he is threatened.
Nomen's fighting is completely ad-hoc with pure strength as its cornerstone with seemingly no grappling skills.
Ryuhei also has an insane level of weapon proficiency when wielding his Berserker a wooden sword wrapped in chains he was able to use this weapon to trade hits with
Gun Park
Quotes
"I am the mad dog, Kagiroi! I never let go once I bite! I will follow you wherever you go!" - Ryuhei Kuroda introducing himself to Neko.
“	The more you try to crush him, the stronger he burns. He will never be broken down. He is a flame that will never go out.	„ -Ryuhei to Sinu.
" Wanna go one round with me? " - Ryuhei to Neko & Gun.
Trivia
Nomen's name "Kagiroi" from which his biker gang also owes it name, is said to be the Japanese word for "Fireworks".
Nomen's mask is derived from traditional Japanese
Noh
theatre. It is most likely modelled after the Zō mask which is actually used when actors are playing the roles of divine women such as goddesses, spirits, and fairies.
Nomen's real name, Ryuhei Kuroda (黒田竜平), in real life, is the birth name of Japanese singer and dancer
RYUHEI
(a member of popular J-Pop boy group
BE:FIRST
).
In Lookism Chapter 391, it is known (stated) by other members of the Biker Gang that Ryuhei has an above average penis with it being called a 'Mighty Dragon'.
Ryuhei had erectile dysfunction before he met
Mitsuki Soma
Ryuhei has been acknowledged by Gun Park to be the best fighter from Workers.

Samuel Seo (서성은 Seo Seongeun)
is the former president of the
Workers
3rd and 4th affiliates. And also a rival of
Jake Kim
, with whom he led
Big Deal
in the past. He also used to be one of the successors of
Gun Park
.
Appearance
Samuel Seo is introduced appearing sophisticated and more mature than his actual age. He has fair skin, with a strong V-Shaped jawline and dark, narrow eyes. His figure is extremely muscular, with a more prominent, broader chest and arms than a majority of characters. His black hair is combed back neatly, and he wears slender, rectangular glasses. He is revealed to bear tattoos, consisting of Sak Yant and images of various objects. He is considered to be attractive by societal standards, as Amy notes.
[
2
]
His standard work attire consists of a clean white suit with a blue tie, occasionally with a brown overcoat draped over his shoulders. He covers his exposed skin, such as his neck and hands, with makeup to cover his tattoos. Outside of work, he is also seen wearing other variations of fashionable matching suits. He isn't as cleaned up, with messy hair that sweeps over his face and rolled sleeves.
Samuel is notable for his continual creation of bizarre and extreme facial expressions representing his current emotion and his numerous moments of fanservice where he is shown wearing little to no clothing.
Personality
When dealing with the general public, he presents a façade of being a well-mannered, charming, young man. He is noted by Daniel to be sarcastic,
[
3
]
although there have been no other confirmations of this. Beneath it is a man who is cold-hearted and ruthless. In regards to business matters, Samuel believes that the ends justify the means and will do whatever it takes to get ahead. He does this through various illegal and underhanded methods such as illegal streaming through forced labor contracts and obtaining monetary loans through false promises.
Despite his arrogant and sadistic attitude, he is shown to have some insecurities that stem from his birth origins. He harbors an inferiority complex that causes him to fly into a rage when he feels he is not being respected or undermined. This is especially the case in situations where Jake is involved.
History
Samuel was born and raised in a poor environment, as his mother abused him and father was absent in his life. He was also bullied by kids in the neighborhood for not having a father. His last name was chosen randomly, and he did not know his father's last name.
[
4
]
As a middle schooler he led the Gangseo Alliance, uniting the local gangs under his leadership. He was powerful enough to be scouted to join Big Deal, one of the Big 4 Crews.
At a young age he was always curious about who his father really is, but his mother never let him discover that himself. Because of this, when Samuel found a photo of his mother with the famous gangster Gapryong Kim, and assumed that the man was his father. This boosted Samuel's confidence, as he strived to improve himself in power in order to be recognized as Gapryong's son. However this belief was shattered when his true biological father returned home to his mother. Enraged at the revelation, it is implied that he killed the two of them but there have never been any confirmations of this.
At the height of the Gangseo Alliance, Samuel felt offended when he was not directly scouted by
Sinu Han
to join Big Deal. Thus, he took the Alliance to confront
Jake Kim
, who was scouted by Sinu himself. After joining Big Deal with Jake, Samuel met people such as a young
Olly Wang
and
Johan Seong
, and looked down on them. It was only then after Sinu was beaten by
Gun
and
Goo Kim
, Big Deal falling under the mercy of Gun, and the revelation that Jake was Gapryong Kim's son, Samuel ended up straying away from Big Deal and it's original goal and ideals, which culminated in him fighting Jake one last time, and lost. Samuel left Big Deal after that, and quickly formed and dismantled his own crew, Gangseo Union, in Gangnam, to gain Gun's approval. Gun then proceeded to take down Samuel and denied him of his approval, judging that he was a ticking time bomb and wasn't enough of a leader like Jake.
Samuel then fought between Jake, Olly, and Johan in a fight as the heads of the
Big 4 Crew
. He was the first to get taken down during the fight. After reflecting on all the fighters and how they have improved in power and status since they last met, Samuel was demoralized and broken. However, this awakened something in Samuel, as he soon developed a new, more brutal, fighting style. Following this, he immediately beat Jake, Johan, and Olly. While this happened, Goo showed up and was amazed by Samuel's performance that he told Samuel that he approved of him and made him his new secret best friend.
Samuel later became the executive of the Fourth Affiliate of the Workers, and was complicit in an illegal streaming business until the downfall of One MCN.
Fighting Prowess
Samuel's fighting style reflects its owner's own savagery fueled by inferiority. His style has been described by many as vicious and uncontrollable with liberal usage of weapons such as brass knuckles. Samuel prefers to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength with a tendency towards punches. Samuel's style is such that his defeated opponents are damaged beyond necessity.
Samuel has been shown to make him able to be on par with Jake Kim and Daniel Park. In the past, he was able to defeat all crew heads after first awakening to his style. Samuel notes that his power peaks when his body feels like it's "burning up." He described this "burning up" as "madness caused by self-hatred."
[
5
]
Zack Lee also experienced this phenomenon and became very strong. Samuel's trigger for this state seems to be excitement for a fight.
In the 1st Gen King arc it is stated by himself and
Seokdu Wang
that he has reached and surpassed Mastery and Samuel was a big part in the battle against Seokdu as he could tank all the headbutts thrown at him by Seokdu while Warren and Eli was put out of commission with just one. Seokdu Wang even went on to say that Samuel Seo has achieved the Stage of Resilience even saying Samuel Seo has The Ultimate Resilience.
In Chapter 466, Samuel was drugged by Jinyoung Park to feel an overwhelming sense of inferiority, causing him to go insane, aiming to kill whoever came in the room he was hidden in. It was revealed that the drugs had caused Samuel to bring up his past, where he deep down believed that Gapryong Kim had been his father, but been disappointed in the end. Afterwards, he began to bring up the incident where he had defeated his own union (Gangseo Union) just to gain Gun's approval, but was rejected. The throwback of these incidents had made Samuel insanely strong, fueling his inferiority complex to the point where even a full force hit from Jake Kim left him unfazed.
What makes his strength even more crazy is that Samuel Seo never had a teacher and learnt a distinct fighting style, his fighting style is barbaric and crude, flaunting off his sadistic nature.
Quotes
I’ll help you find Sinu, but you need to help me too. I want to be king

Trivia
Samuel hides this, but his biological father is an air conditioning technician, he hates him and prefers to believe that, deep down, his father is Gapryong Kim.

Gun Park
Samuel greatly respected his strength and wanted Gun Park's recognition, and was willing to do anything for him to recognize him, even to the point that he would beat his own subordinates for his recognition. Soon Samuel did not understand the reason, and held a grudge against Gun Park.
Eli Jang
Eli and Samuel fought together against the first generation king of Suwon and defeated him.
Daniel Park
New Body
They meet when Daniel stops him in front of the One MCN building and asks if he's part of Workers.
[
1
]
Samuel confirms it, they talk, and he leaves, annoyed.
[
2
]
Later on, after Daniel finds out that Like What and So Funny were being forced to stream due to an inhumane contract, Daniel feels resentfulness and anger towards Samuel for the binding of the contract.  Samuel overall seems to be displeased and suspicious towards Daniel.
After Daniel and Warren deal with the 2 main security guards of One MCN, Daniel can be seen fighting with Samuel, even using one of Samuel's  brass knuckles in their fight. However, Samuel leaves half-way through, thanking Daniel for unknown reasons after talking with Tom Lee. Samuel seems to be nonchalant, while Daniel seems to be displeased and confused.
Samuel was beaten along with Jake by Daniel in the third affiliate while Daniel's body was in the unconscious state.
Old Body
He looks at Daniel's application, while Daniel is annoyed that he is acting so calmly, despite admitting that he was part of Workers. After looking at Daniel's application, Samuel says that he really wants Daniel in the company and hires him.
[
3
]
Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel, and gets into his office using the black badge that Gun gave him. He looks around and finds Samuel's brass knuckle, and a board with pictures of the 4 major crews, and weird markings plastered on them. As he hears Samuel get into his secret office, he hides with Alexander Hwang whose in disguise, under a desk. Samuel seems to be suspicious of Daniel disappearing, and Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel's relations towards the 4 crews as well.
Alexander Hwang
Alexander and Samuel are implied to have known each other before Samuel even joined Big Deal.  Alexander would follow and be loyal to Samuel throughout the years. However, implications of the motivation of staying imply that Alexander wanted to use Samuel.
In the early stages of their relationship, Alexander can be seen trying to make himself of a notable identity towards Samuel, yelling out his name at every possible occasion. Later on after Samuel gets rejected by Gun,  Alexander can be seen telling Samuel to "move on" from Gun throughout the years. In the end, fame and money gets to Alexander, and they develop a relationship where Alexander gets abusive and suspicious of Samuel, even once almost running over Samuel with a car.
Later in the manhwa when Tom Lee is seen capturing Alexander, (which is later revealed that he took him to make him work for the third affiliate) Hwang calls out to Samuel asking him to save him. However, Samuel ignores Alexander and leaves telling him, "It's not personal." This implies that Samuel does not care about Alexander.
Goo Kim
Samuel Seo is one of Goo's four "secret friends". Though initially seeking Gun's approval by defeating Olly, Jake and Johan
[
4
]
, Samuel earned the approval of Goo because of his strength and vicious fighting style.

Synopsis
Daniel Park VS Gun
At the end of the episode, Samuel steps out of the car and walks past Eli into the MCN building. They exchange glances, but he doesn't stop.
[

]
Workers (4 Affiliates)
The two girls featured in the last chapter whisper to each other. One mentions how attractive Samuel is, but the other says that Daniel was still more attractive. Samuel ignores their whispering, even going so far to tell them not to interrupt him. He agrees to hire them because he thinks that they had a 'baby sister' vibe and introduces them to the top five streamers on Kwitch, then leaves to do something else.
[
2
]
Another day, when Daniel goes to One MCN for the first time, he recognizes Samuel and asks him if he's part of Workers.
[
3
]
Samuel grabs Daniel by the arm and confirms it with a smirk. He tells Daniel about the history of Workers, saying it was established to make a hundred billion dollars. He then asks with a fake smile if there was anything that Daniel was concerned about regarding it, and Daniel says no. Samuel leaves, looking miffed.
[
4
]
Daniel submits an application to the executive, Samuel, who tells Daniel that he wants him in the company because of the potential for success. He states that Daniel had an incredibly high number of streamers for his first streamcast, earned the nickname 'King Daniel' already, and was relatable to the viewers.
[
5
]
[missing information, please add]
Samuel stares out the full length window from the top floor and reminds one of the employees to not touch any of the streamer's belongings, because it might leave a trail.
In the morning, he checks up on Daniel. He says that Daniel had been causing a disruption by ordering so much fried chicken, and tells Daniel that he would not be able to escape by asking the deliveryman even if he wanted to, because the food always went through people working for Workers before it went to the streamers. He then asks Daniel if he went into Samuel's personal room (Daniel did), and Daniel attempts to punch him instead of answering, but is stopped by Senior Manager Kim, the leader of the Fourth Affiliate's security team. Samuel states that he always hires people to do his work instead of doing it himself, so he would not fistfight Daniel. Samuel then turns around and leaves, telling security to teach Daniel a lesson.
Upstairs, Samuel reports to Alexander, telling him that their revenue would succeed the Third Affiliate's that month, and reports on the newest streamers. Alexander tells him that he would make a good president. He then asks about how someone came to visit the company from the four major crews.
Samuel says that it was Hostel, and mentions that he saw Eli Jang at the front of the building earlier. He laughs when he mentions Olly Wang's death to Alexander. Samuel also says he saw Daniel, and Alexander says that Gun had approved of him.
Alexander angrily beats Samuel because it was not reported to him earlier. He tells Samuel that he did not want to get involved in the Four Major Crews if it was not necessary.Alexander says that Samuel was still not like his old self.
When he leaves the room, Samuel reflects to the time he met Gun after he managed to beat up a large group of people. Lost in thought, he bumped shoulders with a man. The man handed him the box of fried chicken after exchanging brief words, then takes off his motorcycle helmet to reveal Daniel Park.
Samuel comments that he did not usually deal with intruders, but cracks his neck in preparation.

Sang Baek's combat strength has been compared to that of the 1st Generation Kings by
Diego Kang
who stated that he was more dangerous than the leaders of Busan's Four Major Crews. As the number 2 of the Jinrang Gang, his strength is second only to his leader. He has shown to be very fast as he was able to lightly stab

Synopsis
Episode 34
Zack
asked for a favor from Namsoo to look for a Limited Edition Jordans Shoes from the Craigslist. Having no idea on how much it costs, he only gave Namsoo $300. Namsoo had no choice but to find it despite the fact that it is almost impossible to get it with that price because he did not have the courage to tell Zack. Namsoo, who has almost given up, found a person who agreed to sell him the shoes for that price who, through the profile picture, appears to be a beautiful lady. The two agreed to meet the following day at Gian Station.
The next day at school, Namsoo informed Zack that he had found the shoes. Namsoo insisted on taking the shoes himself although Zack wanted to take it himself, saying that he is experienced enough to spot the product's authenticity (although this is actually because he wanted to meet the girl).
Right after Namsoo met the girl, he was startled with the presence of another two men who threatened to beat him up if he failed to pretend that they all are friends. He then realized that the girl was part of the scamming scene because she looked calm despite the situation. They all went to a quite, dead end, alley, and met the girl's boyfriend who presumably is the leader of the gang. Haeri (the girl) revealed that Namsoo had been chatting with her boyfriend Woojin, a thief from
Gian High
. Woojin took all the money and almost left when Namsoo suddenly stopped him and begged for mercy, stating that it is not his money, but his friend's who is a boxer. Feeling insulted by thinking it was a threat, Woojin beat Namsoo up.
Episode 35
The next day, he nervously informed about the whole incident to Zack. Much to his surprise, Zack didn't scold him nor hit him, but in fact felt guilty for not taking the shoes himself.
Yui
then came and joined the conversation. Yui suggested the idea for Zack to try ordering from them again, this time with his own phone, telling them that although it's a fake phone, they will most probably will still be using it for a while due to the high cost. She also told Zack to change his profile picture into someone else who looked like a pushover, and they all decided on using
Jiho's
picture. Zack decided he would go and confront the thieves alone, but was surprised when
Daniel
volunteered after prodding from Zack's lackeys. The five of them begin to leave. Yui grabs Namsoo and says they should go as well;
Mira
, obviously worried for Zack, makes the excuse to go looking for books in that area.
Jay
also follows secretly on his motorcycle.
Episode 36
While on the way there, Zack, his lackeys, and Daniel all run into
Vasco
and
Jace
. After explaining the situation, Vasco joins them, telling Jace not to come with. He and Zack's lackeys stay behind. Meanwhile, they are being followed by a troublesome trio, Yui, Namsoo and Mira. They all decide to rest at a cafe, and Zack makes a threatening face to some other guys (the lackeys to the thief who beat up Namsoo). Vasco ignores it, and Daniel is uncomfortable.
Zack notices the trio following and goes to greet them. The thug lackeys followed, and threaten Zack, telling him to follow them after noticing the pretty Yui and Mira. Namsoo then sees Woojin coming. Woojin surprises Zack with a punch to the face, then punches him a couple more times before he knows what's going on, much to Yui, Mira and Namsoo's horror.
Mira yells at Woojin and they walk away. Mira wants to report it, but Zack tells her not to. Next, Woojin and his two henchmen (a judo guy and a kicking guy) wait for the meeting with a supposed weakling. Zack, Vasco and Daniel appear; Zack is still bleeding from earlier.
Episode 37
Zack takes out the two henchmen temporarily, and uses the very technique that Daniel used on him to hurt Woojin, but Zack gets beaten by fatigue. A bunch of sophomores (more lackeys from Woojin's school) show up, and Vasco steps in. Soon enough his gang (
the Burn Knuckles
, BNC) shows up.
Episode 38
They join the fight. Vasco waits patiently, and is jumped from behind by one of the three henchmen, the judo guy, who grabs Vasco's shoulders. Vasco easily raises his arms, breaking free effortlessly. Vasco uses his famous vice grip (shoulder grab) to bring him down. Everyone who's felt it sympathizes with the pain.
Meanwhile, Jay smokes next to his motorcycle. Apparently, Woojin called more backup (freshmen), and Jay took them all down by himself. A new face (with another guy) appears, complimenting Jay's fighting skill, saying they don't like the kids from Gian High. He tells Jay that he should stop smoking or he won't get a lover, then he and the other guy leave. Jay drops his cigarette and decides to quit smoking.
Back to the main events, we have Woojin feeling caged. He charges Daniel, since he mistakes Daniel's nervousness as weakness, and realizes that both Vasco and Zack just calmly watch. He wonders why, trying to punch Daniel, but of course our cinnamon roll dodges like a boss. Because of the girls behind him, Daniel knows he can't do anything but fight, so he jabs (quick punch) at Woojin. Woojin jumps back before it hits him. Daniel decides to retry a straight (Zack's signature punch, which Zack showed little Daniel before), and steps forward, hooking (swinging from the side) him in the stomach, then going for the straight, right in the face. The fight is over. Vasco tells Woojin to cherish his girlfriend. Haeri cries over Woojin, holding his hand, and Vasco cries out of jealousy. Vasco insists that the BNC walk home because they don't have helmets.
Gun
was watching the whole time, recognizing Daniel's improvement. The beaten Woojin, leaning on Haeri, and the big judo guy approach and notice Gun (they were in the same high school). They chitchat, and Gun's apparently the same age as them (has to take the qualifying exam for university).
Back at school, Zack says Daniel must be a boxer and he lied, and wants a rematch in an official ring. Namsoo notices that Zack got his shoes in the end and envies it, knowing he couldn't have bought them for the amount of money he had. That's when Yui asks Zack if he'll study for mid-term exams (he won't), which makes Daniel realize he didn't study at all.
Notes
It is implied Jay might have feelings for Daniel in this arc
Many of the characters in this arc are seen in Taejun Park's other comic about smoking
(The Real Anti-Smoking Campaign)

hear a rumor that there is a girl in the Architecture department but all they see are freshman delinquents. When the delinquents rise they are afraid, but they show respect and say they want to join the Burn Knuckles.
Leonn Lee
, a freshman Burn Knuckle,  is curious to see Vasco there.
Meanwhile, in the comics department everyone is chill until

Episode 122
Logan has a flashback to his middle school years. Popular kid Mae was collecting dues from him and wanted to show off to his girlfriend, so he hit Logan. Logan beat him and everyone in the room and met Daniel for the first time.
Logan is disappointed in the state of the comics department. He left his old school to avoid

Senior Manager Kim
is a White Tiger Job Centre member, currently employed by
Tom Lee
. He was contracted to
Workers
before being pulled out. He is the protagonist of his own spinoff manhwa, titled
Manager Kim.
Appearance
Senior Manager Kim at first appears to be an average Korean man of unknown height and black hair. Although he appears old in Lookism, he is shown to be extremely fit and muscular in his own manhwa,
Manager Kim
. He has numerous bullet wounds and cuts around his body from his time serving in the South Korean Special Forces, also has cuts on his fingers presumably from wielding his CQC Silver Yarn. When he is angry, excessive veins emerge from his body and his eyes become bloodshot.
Personality
He is very stiff when it comes to humor but is very loving when it comes to his daughter. When it comes to his daughter he would probably rip everything in his way apart in order to make sure she is safe and takes on jobs that will bring him shame in order to provide for his family.
History
He is an Ex-Sergeant and Special Forces Agent and has carried out numerous missions for his country. He was so dangerous that there are specialized teams dedicated just for him and is also wanted in North Korea with a cash bounty for him and has tried to assassinate the North Korean Supreme Leader twice. He spent one night with a woman and as a result, impregnated her. He wanted to leave his post to care for his daughter, but the government stopped him in order to not let him expose the foreign affairs that they violated. The South Korean government had him attempt to assassinate the North Korean Supreme Leader again in order for him to leave his post.
Fighting Prowess
Manager Kim's fighting style is
CQC
(Close Quarter Combat), a modern and realistic self-defense system that combines many different martial arts, military and police tactics. CQC consists of strikes, kicks, takedowns, joint locks, weapon defense ground fighting and more.
Manager Kim most likely learned CQC within the military as part of his training, likely using it many times to kill or subdue enemy combatants.
He has also used CQC Silver Yarn in a few instances.
Techniques used
Note: Some techniques exist across different martial arts, under different names.
Striking
One-inch punch
Straight/Cross
Elbow strike
Kicking
Low kick
Trivia
He took a liking to Gangdong's Mighty
Warren Chae
, who reminded him of himself, teaching him proper Jeet Kune Do technique, as well as other techniques he learned from his military training and other endeavors.
He has his own spinoff webtoon called
Manager Kim
.

--- FILE: Seokdu_Staffing_Agency.txt ---
The
Seokdu Staffing Agency
was the crew in charge of Suwon before it was subjugated by
Eli Jang
,
Warren Chae
, and
Samuel Seo
.
History
The
Seokdu Staffing Agency
was founded by
Seokdu Wang
, the 1st Generation King of Suwon. Contrary to its name, its dealings were less savory in nature as it hired out its members as thugs to accomplish various goals, from demolishing street vendor stalls to chasing tenants out so an area can undergo redevelopment.
After Seokdu retired, he passed the Agency down to his successor, Changyong Ji, who took Dosu Lee as his vice-head.

—Seokdu Wang  in
episode 408
Seokdu Wang
is the leader of the Suwon Gang, and a member of the
1st Generation
.
Appearance
Seokdu is a tall and muscular young man that wears a blue white-stripped suit, black necktie, and a white polo as inner clothing. He bears a lot of scars on his forehead after all the fights he's been in.
Personality
Seokdu takes pride in his status as a 1st generation king. He seems to care a lot about his comrades and his territory, willing to put a stop to
Eli Jang
,
Warren Chae
, and
Samuel Seo
, by himself from pushing their plan.
He enjoys the thrill of battle, looking forward towards Taesoo's statement that the
2nd Generation
aren't weak as well as complaining to Taesoo as to why "that man", referring to
James Lee
, ended the 1st generation so soon. His love for fighting is shown in his battle with the
Workers
trio, smiling and complimenting their abilities in the heat of battle.

Changyong Ji
Changyong is Seokdu's apprentice, who inherited the

from Seokdu Wang.
Taesoo Ma
They have a friendly relationship as they were shown twice eating having a meal with each other
Fighting Prowess
He was stated by Eli that he wasn't just any regular 1st gen, but a King that ruled through the generation. His signature attack is his headbutts, and just a regular headbutt from him was damaging cars, cement and walls, also the extremely sturdy Warren and Eli almost died with just one headbutt. That is crazy because Eli Jang survived getting beat up by
Tom Lee
who is much stronger than Seokdu for 1 month and Eli could still stand and fight, but a headbutt almost killed him and made him almost lose the will to fight. Seokdu was fighting evenly with the rapidly growing Eli and Samuel (Who both achieved mastery) and barely lost. His durability is great as well as he took an attack that can kill you from a CQC trained Warren Chae and survived.

Seongji Yuk
was a member of the
1st Generation
and the King of Cheonliang. He was called the
Monster of Cheonliang Mountain
, possibly due to him having 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot. He was the mentor of
Vin Jin
. He was a disciple of
Jin Mujin
, who was Vin Jin's father.
Appearance
Seongji Yuk is portrayed as dressing quite messily, wearing a black tank top and a pair of dirty, baggy gray jeans. His footwear seems to be somewhat heavy-duty, and he wears a black jacket tied around his waist and occasionally wears
Cheonliang Fam
jacket over his shoulders.
Physically, he is shown to be quite muscular and handsome in a rugged way, with shaggy black hair that almost reaches his shoulders and solid black irises with prominent eye bags.
He has polydactyly, with six digits on both his hands and feet. Though he lost his extra appendages on both his hands and feet due to Shinmyung Cheon's cruelty in chapter 492, they have since been reattached.
Personality
Seongji is shown to be quite rough in his demeanor, calling Vin Jin a funny bastard and threatening to kill him when called a monster during their first meeting.
Despite this, he is a very dedicated man, choosing to fight the Kojima Brothers as well as three members of Generation 0 in order for the Cheonliang Fam to have a chance to escape. When they were caught, he would choose to take any punishment from the Shaman in Vin Jin's place.
As a result of serving as the offering, he has severe PTSD, choosing to live in the mountains to avoid the eyes of the village's people. This PTSD can even trigger a special kind of seizure that causes him to destroy everything and everyone around him, though he won't remember anything.
History
Early in his life, likely around the age of late elementary school, he was abandoned in Cheonliang by his family, leaving him for dead on its shores. It was there he would be found by Mujin Jin, who had recently plundered the treasure of the Shaman, including the Red Paper. However, Mujin wasn't able to read Japanese, so Seongji claimed he could before feigning amnesia to get Mujin to stay with him, the man agreeing to do so until Seongji remembered. Mujin taught Seongji how to be self-sufficient and raised him for a time, helping him to trust other people again. Mujin would then disappear without a trace, leaving behind Cheonliang's treasure for Seongji.
Afterwards, he became a sacrifice for the Shaman's scams due to his polydactyl features and was trained to become a yaksha (a type of "bodyguard") for
Shaman
's child, a
Cheon Taejin
, which he never became. He eventually escaped, but upon realizing that he'd be similarly rejected by the outside world, believed that he wouldn't be able to leave and fell into his first seizure, afterward seeking refuge by hiding in the mountains. Since Shinmyeong had no further need of Seongji, planning to make Vin the new sacrifice, he would scheme against the young man by spreading rumors of a monster living in Cheonliang to the circles outside. After a lengthy amount of time spent getting into unwanted fights, he would meet Jichang Kwak.
One day, the children that would go on to be the
Cheonliang Fam
came across him, though Seongji met them with open arms and hospitality, teaching them about the truth of Cheonliang, with Vin and Sujin Kim joining the family later on.
After Vin discovered the truth of his mother's death, he stormed the shaman's complex alone, causing Seongji to come to his aid while setting his shack alight to call in the other 1st Generation Kings. He would be able to defeat the two Yakshas easily, and would come face to face with
James Lee
, awakening to three thresholds in the process and defeating the One Man Circle. However, since his fam would be captured, he allowed himself to be brutalized, even having his extra appendages severed, before the 1st Generation Kings intervened.
In the wake of that event, Seongji tried to distance himself from the fam to prevent them from being targeted by his enemies, as well as not to endanger them in his seizures.
After being set up by Taejin Cheon to believe he was the murderer of
Sujin Kim
, he committed suicide by walking into the ocean and tying a chain hooked to an anchor around his neck, resulting in him drowning.
Relationships
Vin Jin
He and Vin Jin were quite close, as Seongji was his master and the head of the Cheonliang Fam. Vin deeply regrets not embracing Seongji during the set-up, and blames himself for the King's death.
Mujin Jin
He was Seongji Yuk's master, raising him after Seongji was abandoned by his parents.
Shigeaki
and
Hiroaki Kojima
They taught him Kudo during his Yaksha training with them
Cheonliang Fam
They called him their master after escaping from the Shaman's scams.
1st Generation
Despite what some might think, Seongji was close enough to several members of Generation 1, namely
Taesoo Ma
,
Gongseob Ji
,
Seokdu Wang
,
Jaegyeon Na
, and
Jichang Kwak
, for them to join forces to invade Cheonliang after Seongji sent them a message, likely asking for help, and even attacking
James
and revenge for Seongji.
Fighting Prowess
Due to the nature of Cheonliang's fighters, he was likely at the upper end of the 1st Generation. He has been shown to have immense grip strength, grabbing the ribs of two experienced fighters, three in each hand, and squeezing them to the point where they noticeably bend and crack. Later he was revealed to be the disciple of Ssireum legend,
Jin Mujin
(Vin Jin's father and a man strong enough to rival the monsters of the 0 generation), he was also taught by the
Yamazaki brothers
to be the Yaksha of
Cheon Taejin
which he never became. His style mainly included
Jin Mujin's Ssireum,
a style where while fighting one can break opponents' bones with their grip strength and both
Grapling and Striking Kudo
taught to him by the yakshas of the shaman. He was also proficient with
Judo,
which he taught to Mary Kim and the Cheonliang Fam.
In his fight with
James Lee
, James states that
Seongji has overcome two
Masteries
, of both toughness and power
, putting them on a similar level. Despite lacking experience compared to James, he would be able to see his invisible attacks by believing in his eyes, allowing him to overcome
the
Mastery
of speed
, putting him a level above James, and allowing Seongji to be the first character in Lookism to defeat him, before James achieved the strength mastery.
In regards to sheer potential, Mujin Jin stated that Seongji was the one with the most potential in his life, and even James Lee attempts to scout him, stating that he'd be better than the two he currently had, likely referring to
Goo Kim
and
Gun Park
.
Due to having his extra appendages cut off by Shinmyung Cheon, his strength has been greatly lowered, likely reducing his fighting prowess permanently, but later his fingers were rejoined.
Quotes
"I you haven't forgotten why they call me the
King of Cheonliang
"
"Also, you're not a Monster. Your eye is cool as Hell"
"You've never seen anyone who was better than you? I have"

Trivia
He has been shown to have an illness that causes him to cough up blood, though he takes medication to manage it. This is a result of serious seizures caused by PTSD from being a sacrifice.
One particular inspiration for his appearance may be the Chinese influencer @cr0102, as pointed out by several members of the community.

—Daniel's mother  in
episode
17
Seonhui Park (박선희
Park Seon-Hui
, which can also be written as
Park Seon-Hee
) is
Daniel Park
's mother who supports him throughout the story. Although Daniel is originally blind to her love and sacrifice for him, he later realizes how hard she's worked to provide for him and help him, and hence, works to give back to her.
Appearance
She is a middle aged woman with heavily wrinkled skin and dark eyes.
She also has short curled hair and usually wears a white shirt with flower-patterned pants and blue flip-flops.
Personality
She is kind and hardworking. She tries to give her son the best, even if it means she has to make do with less and face humiliation. For example, she would pick up the fallen legs of crabs in the marketplace to make soup for
Daniel
, even though the vendors would get angry at her for not paying.
She faces her problems with courage and does not give up. This shows how brave and resilient she is. She tries not to be dependent on anyone. Overall, she's a sweetheart and a very loving person.
Quotes
I wonder if Daniel has tried this.. He'd like it.
- Episode 17
Trivia
Her full name was only disclosed in Chapter 433, more than 8 years after the beginning of the manhwa.
Its implied in Chapter 191 that Daniels mother might be seeing someone romantically. Having put on weight and using makeup. But we hear nothing about this person, leading to many coming to the conclusion that it was just a short term thing.

Daniel's Grandmother
Daniel Park
First Body
As Daniel's mother, she is very protective of him. When she finds out he's being bullied, she charges at them despite being half their size and immediately transfers Daniel Park out of the school despite financial problems. She never considered Daniel as a burden to her. She is rarely seen scolding Daniel. She always tries to make good food for him and even saved up money for his glasses.
When Daniel slowly became more responsible, she became very proud of him. She was really grateful for the gift he gave to her on Thanksgiving. She was also happy at her son's progress in academics and was glad he wasn't being bullied at J High.
Second Body
While Daniel visited his mother in his other body, she treated him kindly and is very generous. She gave Daniel (currently in his other body) 5,000 won from picking up scraps and told him to take care of her son (Daniel in his normal body). She was grateful to new Daniel for not bullying her own son.

Death you say? Sure. That doesnt sound bad to me either
"
—Yamazaki Shingen  in
episode 521
Shingen Yamazaki is the father of
Gun Park
and the former President of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
He is the
Great Power
which the 0th Generation fought against. He has fought
Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang
at some point before Gun's birth and this led to him falling into a lethargic stupor. He is revealed to have been the younger brother of Shintaro Yamazaki all along, who became the head of the clan due to the midwife's scheme.
Appearance
Shingen was a tall and muscular middle-aged man with long black hair and white eyes with black clera. He had around his body from neck to toe tattoos who range from tiger-shaped patterns, one on his back and two on his broad shoulders and a bunch of cloud tattoos over his body. He wears nothing but a simple white tonga, but he casually wears a black hanfu tied by a dark gray rope under a dark gray kimono.
Personality
Shingen's behavior by the time he had fathered Gun and his brothers is like that of a introvert, he is also cold to most of everyone he meets and sees, and it seems he doesn't even know the children that he has from all of his concubines, Gun is one of the many children of his.
As noted by his father and concubine, Shingen had once been an exceptionally vicious and blood thirsty man and was feared as a literal demon by both his syndicate and enemies. However, as implied, his defeat by
Gapryong Kim
and his gang had caused a severe psychological blow to him. After his defeat, Shingen had become extremely lethargic and practically unresponsive to almost everyone and everything. So much so that he barely payed attention to “concubines”, of which he barely payed conscious attention to and he himself had no idea that he even had children with them. This is shown where he hardly ever payed attention or noticed Gun’s mother despite spending so much time together with her and despite her talking so much about their son and his accomplishments, Shingen had likely completely ignored her. Having no idea who Gun was when he came face to face with him and asked him who he was.
Despite his generally lethergic and apathetic behavior, Shingen can come out of it should he find sufficient reason to. As shown when he had taken action to defend himself when the three vassal family heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate had tried to kill him. As shown, Shingen retains deep respect for his “opponent” who is in Korea and he refused to die or be defeated by anyone elses hand.
During his last fight against his twin brother, Shintaro, Shingen fully exhibited his emotions. As shown where he showcased the deep love, care and trust he had for his twin brother refusing to believe that he would betray him. Shingen himself admitted that if Shintaro has simply asked him for the position of the head of the Yamazaki, Shingen would give it to him no questions asked, with him expressing that he always believed that Shintaro was much more suited for the position.  Later, he would finally acknowledged Somi when she betrayed him and stabbed him, expressing interest in her when she began revealing her true emotions. When two of his sons came to his side to help him fend off Shintaro’s forces, Shingen expressed surprise and developed a level of attachment to them immediatly, with him later expressing anger when Shintaro killed them. In the end, Shingen eventually acknowledged Gun and died protecting him.
During his youth, Shingen also exhibited an outgoing personality and seemed generally positive as a person. It is likely that his circumstances were similar to Gun and the way he seemed "vicious" and "bloodthirsty" to others was most likely instilled into him by his father.
Relationships
Gun Park
Shingen is seen to be cold to everyone, it is shown he doesn't really know who Gun is as the first interaction of him and Gun is strained and it seems that he could probably not know his other kids.
During Shintaro's rebellion, Shingen started expressing interest in Gun, to the extent of even protecting him and losing an arm in the process. Before his death, Shingen apologises to Gun and saves Gun's life in one final act of sincerity in exchange for losing his life.
Shintaro Yamazaki
Shingen had a sibling and brotherly relationship with Shintaro, which was shown positively during their youth. Despite the internal turmoils and tragedy that would come in their adulthood, Shingen still loved his brother and believed that he wouldn't go as far as to deliberately start a rebellion on his own and that there was a misunderstanding, also admitting in tandem that he would've given him the position if he just asked. Shingen spent his last moments apologizing to Shintaro and understood why his anger came to be.
Somi Park
Shingen initially showed signs of coldness towards Somi due to his lethargic state, but when the rebellion instigated by Shintaro came to be, Shingen admitted he was expressing interest in the latter and even spared her life despite being one of the traitors going against him.
Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
Shingen during the era of Gapryong's Fist.
He was one of the two people who were a threat to Gapryong Kim at the time. Due in part to his colossal size and muscularity, he fights ferociously and brutally, maiming many of the gang members who ambushed him effortlessly. He also possesses the "Black Bone" trait which supposedly makes him immune or somewhat invulnerable to blades and swords. Like all the generational heads of Yamazaki clan he also inherited Ultra Instinct State with a greater control over it, due to his ogre like build he has immense strength to fight all the vassals of Yamazaki clan who rebelled against him.
Even in his lethargic state, Shingen was still powerful enough to gradually overwhelm Shintaro despite likely not having fought since his defeat at the hands of Gapryoung Kim. It was as such that Shintaro severely wounding him with the Yodo Muramasa and taking one of his arms away was due to Shingen deliberately letting him so, in an act to protect Gun, rather than Shingen not being able to intercept his attacks.
Congenital Ultra Instinct
"Do you know why he fights alone when he wants to go all out? That's because while others adjust their Ultra Instincts to become stronger, Shingen adjusts his Ultra Instinct to suppress his strength, to avoid tearing his subordinates into pieces. The Trait of the Yamazaki is indiscriminate violence. The Child of the Reverse Eyes is the one born with that nature. The moment the child with the Reverse Eyes stops controlling his Ultra Instinct,
the Oni comes out."
-
Gapryong Kim
, CHAPTER 525
Being born with the Reverse Eyes congenitally, Shingen is also capable of entering a true-unconscious state where he relinquishes his control over his Ultra Instinct and starts fighting purely on his own instincts for battle. In this state, Shingen is incapable of distinguishing allies from foes, and is unconscious about his own strength.
In this state, not only was he capable of ripping bodies apart near effortlessly even with only one arm and fatal injuries all over his body, but was also vastly more powerful than Shintaro and even rendered the advantage of the Yodo Muramasa completely null.
Quotes
"
Yamazaki Shintaro.
I would've given you the position of the family head anytime if you just asked. But you dare break the moral laws of family traditions?
Are you that desperate for this position?
" - Chapter 524
"Kid, Tell me. If there's something you want, I'll give it to you." - Chapter 525, to
Gun Park
"This is my first, and last bit of sincerity to you. Gun, Make it out and make sure you live.
And, I'm sorry, I should've given you.... your nam--"
- Shingen's last thoughts, Chapter 527
Trivia
He has many wives and children just like his Korean counterpart Gapryong Kim except Gapryong Kim was a womanizer and didn't have concubines.

—Shinmyung Cheon  in
episode TBA
Shinmyung Cheon (천신명)
is a minor character in Lookism, and a major antagonist of the
Cheonliang Arc
.
Appearance
Shinmyung Cheon has a somewhat odd appearance, with bushy eyebrows, a large forehead, small eyes, and M-pattern baldness. He normally dresses in traditionally-designed grey clothes and no shoes. While performing the duties of a Shaman, he dons a colorful red mubok (무북) with blue, green, and white accents, as well as a solid red gat (갓) with a gat-ggeun (갓끈) decorated with colored beads alternating between red and yellow. He also wields a sinkal (신칼) and a mubel (무벨), similar to real Korean Mudang.
Personality
TBA
Relationships
Vin Jin's mother
Vin Jin's mother was a target of the shaman's scam who he forced into becoming a maid by preventing her and her son from escaping the region. During her time serving him, Shinmyung is implied to have sexually assaulted her several times, likely from lust, though reasons related to vengeance may be possible. The shaman would ultimately strangle the woman to death in an act of rage.
Synopsis
In chapter 495, he was cornered by the visiting first-generation kings before given a chance to escape by his believers. He managed to escape by climbing all the way up to the cliff only to get beaten by Vin Jin mercilessly, knocking nearly all of his teeth out before almost strangling him to death. Though Vin would ultimately relent so as to not kill him, Shinmyung tried to retaliate by lifting a huge rock above Vin's head to bludgeon him to death. In the process, however, he stepped on the headband of Vin's mother, causing him to slip when Vin picked it up. After slipping, he fell off the cliff despite Vin's effort to grab him and have his head crushed by the very rock he tried to use earlier, as Taejin looked on in shock.
Fighting Prowess
The shaman has not been shown to be a fighter, instead relying on his bodyguards, the Kojima Brothers.

The Yamazaki follow the rules.
"
—Shintaro Yamazaki  in
episode 520
Shintaro Yamazaki is the twin brother of Shingen Yamazaki and the former President of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
He was the mastermind of birth of Shingen Yamazaki's children (including Gun Park)n order to produce forces for the next generation following the Syndicate's defeat against Kim Gapryong's Group. He was originally the older brother of Shingen Yamazaki who was fated to be head of the clan but didn't become one due to the midwife's scheme.
Appearance
Shintaro  Yamazaki is seen as a tall lean like man but is muscular, he has fairish skin like Shingen, he has a jet black colored slick back hair style similar to Gun's, he has broad shoulders, he is very handsome, has features like Shingen. He has Tiger tattoos too, except it doesn't cover his chest and torso part but at his sides and arms and down to the legs.
He is usually seen using a white Kimono and a white Haori with a black crest of the Yamazaki symbol, he also uses light grey Hakama pants, white tabi socks, and white geta clogs and he is usually see with a black fan that he is either holding or tucking it in his Hakama pant's waist area.
Personality
Shintaro himself is noted to be exceptionally intelligent and capable, to the point that many in the Yamazaki Syndicate believe that he should be its leader.  However, Shintaro is a staunch believer in the Yamazaki Syndicate’s rules and traditions to a fanatical degree. As shown, Shintaro is extremely devoted to his twin brother Shingen. Having viciously refused the offer of the three Branch Family Heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate to become the new head of the clan due to his brother’s lethargy and proceeded to brutally execute them for betraying the syndicates traditions.  While he acknowledges that his brother’s lethargy is determental to the orginization as a whole and him taking over the syndicate would beneifit and restore the syndicate to its former glory, Shintaro never the less continues to insist to follow the syndicate’s rules despite the degredation and weakening of the group as a whole.
A serious man who places the Yamazaki Clan's rules above all else, even commanding a young Gun Park to kill his son for dissuading him from becoming the next Clan Head. As noted by the Branch Family Leader’s who he executed, him ordering the death of his own child had a deeper psychological effect on Shintaro than he initially believes and he may feel subconscious remorse at having done so and this has lead him to become even more fanatical in following the Syndicate’s traditions and rules. Later on knowing the truth about his birth, he gets completely broken down mentally and goes on to kill Shingen to become the family head
As shown, after the truth of his birth was revealed, Shintaro immediatly felt immense guilt, despair and sadness at the death of his only son Haruto. Shintaro truly treasured and loved Haruto and fully acknolwedged his competence and skill as a leader and knew that if the Gun had become the next head of the Yamazaki, Haruto’s supporters would likely revolt. Hence, the need for Haruto to die to preserved the syndicate and the rules and traditions Shintaro held so high. with Shintaro being able to initially maintain his sanity due to believing it was for the greater good of the syndicate. But when the truth was revealed to him on how he was the true firstborn and the true heir of the syndicate, Shintaro immediatly realized that Haruto’s death was in vain and that as his own first born son, Haruto was always meant to be the heir.
This guilt of throwing away his son’s life for nothing completely distabalized Shintaro’s psyche. With him choosing to become the head of the Yamazaki clan due to him clinging to the rules and traditions he held and put the utmost importance in since the day he was born in order to avoid the despair of how pointlessly he had thrown away the life of his only son. With Shintaro even admitting that he never wanted to be the head in the first place and that he had only done so due to the “rules” demanding that he take the position. Upon successfully taking the position however, Shintaro admitted that this only brought him more despair and made him feel emptier as time went on. As shown from Gun’s return to the syndicate years later, Shintaro had already become suicidal and had long since decided that he wanted to die while still within the “rules” he followed and valued so much; by having Gun kill him and take his place as the new Yamazaki Head. In the end of his life, Shintaro was relieved to have finally escaped the rules of the Yamazaki he had lived under for so long and died content leaving everything to Gun.
Relationships
Haruto Yamazaki
It is seen that Shintaro doesn't have that much mercy on Haruto, as he was the one that made Haruto kill himself, as it was because he managed to make Gun see the bright side of things and almost turn down the role of the Yamazaki heir. When he realises that Haruto's suicide was a vain cause on learning the secret of his birth he completely breaks down.
Shingen Yamazaki
It is shown that Shintaro is dedicated to Shingen and even turned down the role of being the Yamazaki leader, as he said he will never break that Yamazaki protocol of the fact the oldest child gets to be the heir but on realising the sceret of his birth he gets a psycophathic trigger to kill his brother to follow the rule of the eldest child becomes the clan head. He also stated that he would correct the wrongdoings of the former oyabun and will become the clan leader himself.
Synopsis
During birth both Shintaro and Shingen where born as twins but due to the Midwife's scheme Shingen became the eldest son and by succesion order he became the President of Yamazaki Syndicate,which was by birth right the position of Shintaro, even as the vice president of the syndicate he worked hard for the syndicate and helped it to flourish,their birth secret was known by former Yamazaki president and their father,Yamazaki Shinji, but he made no correction to this mistake as everyone thought Shintaro had no
reverse eyes
which
was the distingushing  feature of the family head( not succesion by birth).
After the rebellion of the vassal families of the syndicate, When Shintaro came to know the truth form the midwife and the former oyabun he conspired against Shingen with Park Somi and even stabbed Shingen by manipulating Park Somi,killed the former oyabun killed the nameless descendants of Shingen who were protecting him and revealed that he also had Ultra Instinct.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Ultra Instinct
Like all Yamazaki Family Members he also has black bone and Ultra Instinct that he could control on will ,unlike Shingen and Gun who where always in
Reverse Eyes
mode further his speed ,fighting prowess is somewhat equivalent to that of Shingen and he also has impenetrable Black Bone. He also had same raw strength as Shingen and easily twisted the necks of Shingen's nameless children and crushed their skulls easily. Though, like his younger sibling, he inherited UI since birth. He is also proficient with Akido which helped him to fight on par with Shingen, he is also proficient with blades and katanas.
Years after Shingen's death and his rise to leadership of the Yamazaki Syndicate, Shintaro became immensely powerful, where even though he fought in a carefree and depressed manner, he was able to overpower Gun Park, who had been training in Korea for years. Therefore, it is impossible to determine his true strength, since, even while fighting Gun in his cogenital "Oni" Ultra Instinct state, he was merely reflecting on his entire life and decisions with remorse. Even more so, he forced his own death by forcing Gun's fist to pierce his stomach.

Johan
(who then was a lost kid) in order to help him support himself.
[

]
History
Sinu was found and raised by the residents of Big Deal Street. He earned the nickname, "The Boy of Promise" due to his dedication and devotion to protect the street. In order to accomplish this, he joined and took over
Big Deal
, becoming the new "Big Boss".

Magami
,
Sato
, and
Doo.

Sinu has a lot of potential ever since he was a kid, overtaking Big Deal and earning the throne. His fighting ability was honed by protecting the Big Deal street for years. It also further developed when he was constantly fighting under the Workers after he sold himself to the organization.
Sinu is very powerful, considering he managed to almost beat up
Goo

At the 2nd affiliate, When Sinu fought Jake Kim, and was attacking him with ruthless speed, as he mastered a technique that only one person from each generation managed to master it. It's called
Invisible Attacks
, which is attacking your opponents' blind spots so fast it becomes invisible to the eye.
Sinu has reached a level that he can take on the duo of Eli Jang and Warren Chae whom could defeat a 1st Gen King together (and they most likely got stronger since then) by himself with no damage taken while they were bloodied and beaten, the only damage Sinu took was from a sneak cheap shot by Mandeok Bang, but Sinu was surprised with the duo's endurance as even though they were bloodied and beaten they were still standing.

7

"
You're the hope of the Yamazaki Family and you're also my hope. Please act accordingly.
"
—Park Somi  in
episode 520
The
mother of
Gun Park
.
She was one of the 8 women tasked to bear the child of
Yamazaki Shingen
as a member of the Hangure Family. As a punishment for coveting Shingen's body, she and the 7 other women had to cut off their left pinkies.
She told Gun to not partake in leisurely activities until Shingen gave him a proper name. Her brainwashing Gun to become ruthless lead to Gun slapping her which she accepted happily. After
Yamazaki Shintaro
and Somi betray Shingen, she helped Gun escape to Korea.
Later on, she passed away while trying to save Gun from being cut down by Shintaro.
Appearance
Missing her left pinky.
Has a carp tattoo on her right shoulder.
Personality
As shown, Somi was a woman of ambition and driven primarily out of loyalty and duty to her own family. As noted by
Shintaro Yamazaki
, Somi had willingly volunteered to become one of Shingen’s concubines was in order to elevate the  position and power of her family. Due to this, Somi constantly pushed Gun to become the ideal heir of the Yamazaki Family, frequently punishing him when he acts “unbefitting” as the future leader of the clan, such as when he acted like a regular child during his childhood, and pushed him to become more and more ruthless. With Somi validating this treatment and parenting towards him due to her placing her hope on him to help her achieve her aspirations.  Somi later showcased to have a fixation with Shingen and pushed her son to gain his acknowledgement, with the initial underlying reason being that she was in love with Shingen and hoped that Gun gaining his approval would finally get him to “see” her. However, Somi would later admit that she truly did not love or care either about Gun or Shingen, agreeing to Shintaro’s proposal to have her help him usurp Shingen’s position as the syndicate head when he offered to make him his new wife and have new son together with him to solidify her position and power as the true head wife of the Yamazaki. Agreeing to having both Shingen killed and Gun executed to secure Shintaro’s position as the new head. Ultimately showing that she did not truly love and care for Gun as her son nor love or care for Shingen as a romantic partner, but instead saw them as tools to further elevate her position and power in the Yamazaki clan.
However, as revealed, despite her actions being fueld by ambition and strong sense of duty to her family, Somi does indeed harbor genuine care and love for Gun. As shown where she had secretly helped him escape Japan after the death of his father to protect him and avoid being killed by Shintaro and the rest of the Yamazaki Syndicate to solidify the change of power. Later, she would die shielding Gun from Shintaro’s sword, saving his life. As shown, Somi herself is greatly preplexed by her maternal love and instincts, with her actively wondering why she felt such a strong urge to protect Gun when she had only had him to use as a tool for her and her family’s ambitions. In the end of her life, Somi eventually realized that like Shingen, she truly did care for and love her son and did not regret sacrificing herself to protect him.
Relationships
Gun Park
Somi Park's relationship with her son, Gun Park, was built on strict discipline and high expectations. She saw him as the hope of the Yamazaki Family and refused to let him engage in leisure until he was given a proper name by Yamazaki Shingen. Her harsh parenting shaped Gun into a ruthless fighter, conditioning him to suppress emotions and prioritize strength. Despite this, she ultimately proved her love for him by sacrificing herself to save him from Shintaro Yamazaki’s attack. Her death deeply impacted Gun, triggering his true Ultra Instinct.
Yamazaki Shingen
Somi was one of the eight women selected to bear a child for Yamazaki Shingen, the powerful leader of the Yamazaki Clan. She harbored feelings for him but, like the others, was forced to sever her left pinky as a sign of her commitment. Her loyalty to Shingen was unwavering, and she raised Gun with the sole purpose of making him worthy of his lineage. While it is unclear how deep her personal connection with Shingen was, she dedicated her life to ensuring his legacy through Gun.

Quotes
"You're the hope of the Yamazaki Family and you're also my hope. Please act accordingly."
Trivia
Somi was shown to have been deeply disliked and hated by Shingen’s other Concubines. Due to Gun being the only one of Shingen’s children to inherit the Yamazaki’s clan’s “
Reverse Eyes
”, the other children he had fathered were treated like they never existed by the rest of the clan.  Causing their mothers to frequently harass her in their frustration.
It was confirmed by Shingen’s other concubines that Somi also had Korean blood. It was later clarified that the “Park Family” was vassal yakuza family sworn to the Yamazaki. However, due to their Korean Blood, their standing amongst the rest of the syndicate was not high, nor were they respected much by the other vassal families. It was only with Somi’s actions in becoming Shingen’s concubine and bearing Gun and later marrying Shintaro and becoming the official legal wife of the Yamazaki, was her family properly acknowledged and treated rightfully.
Unlike typical mothers, she raised Gun Park with extreme discipline, refusing to let him play or act like a normal child. Her methods contributed to Gun’s cold and calculating nature.

"
Still learning English. Need new pants.
"
—Sophia Alexander  in
episode 318
Sophia Alexander
(Александра Софья)
is a minor character appearing in
Lookism
,
Manager Kim
, and
Dead Mansion
. She is a member of H Group, serving as
Steve Hong
's bodyguard, and also acts as a trainer to
Daniel Park
and
Jay Hong
.
Appearance
Sophia is a tall and exceptionally well muscled woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. She has a very defined face with strong features, and typically wears her hair loose.
Personality
Sophia comes off as a stoic, expressionless woman with a no-nonsense, all-serious attitude. She shows clear intolerance for certain phrases, such as "brought in" or "broke in." Beneath her seemingly emotionless exterior, however, lies a passionate, dedicated, and dutiful person, driven by a strong sense of honor and responsibility. She also has a mildly comical dense streak, as shown when she misinterpreted her employer's words due to a language barrier.
Relationship
Alexander Alyssa
- It's mentioned that she's related to Sophia by blood, so she might be her daughter. However, given the sense of distance and the fact that they’re seeing each other after a long time, it’s more likely that they’re relatives rather than immediate family.
Alexander Valentina
- She is related by blood, but upon hearing of the atrocities she committed, she became furious and declared that she would personally punish her.
Synopsis
Sophia Alexander accompanied Steve Hong to
Daniel Park
's home. She knocked him out, and stood by Steve as he negotiated for Daniel Park to work for him. Once Daniel agreed to help fight against the Workers, she trained him to lose weight.
She is also responsible for
Jay
's training in Systema and Kali/Arnis.
Fighting Prowess
She stands well over 2 meters tall, with a massive build and monstrous strength—ripping off a front door like it’s nothing and slamming people into the ground with ease. As the one who taught
Jay Hong
Systema and given her special forces background, her weapons skills are also top-notch. In a sparring scene with
Daniel Park
, she fought using a knife, making it likely that she was the one who taught Jae the Filipino martial art of Kali/Arnis.
She once knocked out the sturdy, durable Daniel with a single knee strike. Even Daniel—who had greatly grown after fighting against
Gun Park
,
Senior Manager Kim
, and
Tom Lee
—was so overwhelmed by her power that he lost all will to fight and could only watch as his body was dragged away in fear.
Although she’s not heavily featured in the story, Daniel’s flashbacks portray her as a cold and ruthless trainer. At one point, she attacked him with a knife using her thick arms—treating the training as if it were a live combat situation. This reflects the mindset of someone with a special forces background, where a single moment of carelessness can mean life or death.
The Systema used by Daniel is revealed to be the Alexander Systema, developed by Sophia herself. Considering that only a few characters in the Park Taejun Universe have created their own unique martial arts, Sophia's presence stands out all the more.
Quotes
TBA
Trivia
Daniel Park
calls her by the nickname “Sophie”, implying that they grew emotionally close through harsh training. Likewise, there are depictions suggesting that Sophia also developed a sense of fondness in their teacher-student relationship.
Out of all the
Lookism
characters, she is one of the most copy-pasted by PTJ.

Synopsis
Episode 91
Zack
has not been to school lately, and
Jiho
asks the class president who will run on Sports Day.
Yui
is in the second position, and the president decides that anyone fast enough to dodge
Zack's
punches can run quickly as well.
Daniel
is put as the third runner, and after seeing this,
Jay
volunteers for second. They are missing a girl runner when Zack appears, having been in special training, and is intent on proving to
Mira
that he is better than Daniel.
In a men's soccer game between the Fashion and Practical Music departments, Zack scores a goal from close up. Fashion's costume is a honeybee while Practical Music is dressed as animals. As Daniel gets the ball, Zack thinks that Daniel cannot do any better than what he did, getting past ten guys. Then, Zack thinks of his experiences seeing his bullies kick a ball, and scores a long-distance shot.
In tug of war, Music vs Vocal and Dance, Practical Music prevails. The next is Fashion vs. Architecture, the latter dressed as riding dinosaurs, and
Vasco
challenges Daniel to a one-on-one tug of war contest.
Episode 92
The tug of war commences, and Zack causes a Fashion forefeit by purposefully tying Daniel's end of the rope to a basketball hoop, which Vasco pulls down anyway.
Vin
kicks
Duke
to take out his frustration.
In Practical Music vs. Architecture's Break the Gourd, Practical Music wonders why none of the Architecture students are throwing. Then, they realize that they are just waiting for Vasco, who breaks the gourd in one shot. Zack also throws well in Fashion vs. Vocal and Dance, but Daniel also delivers the final blow. Again, Vin smacks Duke, callling him a roadblock. After Duke insists that he has done nothing wrong, he is beaten in a deserted alley. Vasco appears to help him, telling him that he is cool before taking off his shirt.
Episode 93
Vin's two sidekicks watch in horror as Vin mocks Vasco, calling him "the fool from Construction Dept." However, as Vin tries a leg sweep on Vasco, the latter refuses to budge, and instead flips Zack with one hand, effectively removing his sunglasses. Duke asks Vasco if he can become strong as well, to which Vasco gives him his insane workout plan.
The last event is the relay race. Since the Beauty department has only one guy when there is need of two, Zack has volunteered to help, and he faces calls of traitor has he stands beside Daniel and Ho Jeong. As
Eli
and Jay come racing, neck to neck, Daniel internally thanks Jay for the baton. Daniel and Zack race, and they are both running at the same speed.
Episode 94
Zack pulls ahead near the end of the race. Since Mira is watching, he is determined to win.
Young Mira shows young Zack her stuffed bear Brownie, calling it her best friend. Zack calls it childish, and asks what he is if the bear is her best friend. As Mira drops Brownie, Zack demands if this is how she treats her best friend when he realizes Mira is in pain. After running Mira to the hospital, it is revealed that Mira had burst her appendix, but she thanks Zack, saying that he was amazing.
Meanwhile, in present day, Zack runs out of stamina. Daniel overtakes him by 0.04 seconds. In the talent show, Daniel and Duke perform again.
Zack is sitting on the steps, mourning his loss, when Mira and Daniel come to find him. He does not hear Daniel's explanation for being with Mira and instead assumes that it is because he is a loser. However, Mira drops her phone, which Daniel fails to catch. However, Zack is closer to the phone and is able to catch it. Mira says he has saved Brownie again, and Zack sees the bear keychain attached to her phone. Again, Zack is called amazing, and he is in renewed spirit as he heads to the party. At the party, he continues to catch anything that is dropped.
Episode 95
It's raining and dark out.
Mira
and
Zack
are sharing an umbrella as they walk to school. Mira had forgotten her cellphone at school, and Zack had agreed to accompany her to school.
When at school, Mira suddenly sees two figures and screams. It turns out to be
Jace
and
Vasco
. Vasco clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. They great each other and ask if Zack's ok. Zack pretends he is, but he is actually frozen in fear.
It turns out that Vasco and Jace are there because of the story of the ghost lady. Apparently, at the end of the school corridor, there's a storage room that holds a portrait of the ghost lady. The story goes that the lady had married rich, but had been chased into the streets on a rainy day right after her children were born. Hence, she haunts the schoolyard when it rains, trying to find her children. If someone who isn't a child looks into her eyes, they will die unless they either cry like a baby or give her a doll. If they give her a doll, the ghost lady would be so glad that she would disappear and grant the person a wish.
Vasco says that he's come because he wanted to make a wish for people to stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Vasco's superstitious ideas, making fun of Vasco, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.
When Zack arrives at the storage room, he realizes that the lights can't open. He then rushes over to a pane of glass, only to see the portrait of the ghost lady leering at him, bloodshot eyes wide. Zack hurriedly signs his name on the glass and skidaddles. As he runs back to the classroom, he cries like a baby just in case.
At the classroom, Jace is incredulous that Zack had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Vasco, but, Vasco, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.
The next morning, the school is abuzz with the news that Zack had signed his name on the portrait, and everyone flocks to the storage room to see if it is true.
When they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane. Zack realizes that the portrait's lady's eyes are closed, and that he had actually seen the ghost the night before. He faints and wets his pants.
In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.
In the epilogue,
Daniel
says that he's felt as if someone was following for a while already. He wonders if he's ill. The ghost lady is seen following him, blushing. The chapter ends, saying that the ghost lady seems to have fallen in love.

Synopsis
Episode 112
Vasco
realizes that, even though original
Daniel
had persevered in exercising for 3 months already, he wasn't getting any thinner. So he's determined to find out why. That day, Vasco followed Daniel to the convenience store.
When a customer began to berate Daniel for not heating up the food and was acting really confrontational, Vasco told him to heat it himself, and that store employees are still people. Daniel tries to get Vasco to stop because the customer is known for his bad temper, but, instead, the customer apologizes meekly.
Later, when a middle-aged looking woman comes over to buy alcohol, Vasco asks for her identification. Angered, she asks how old they were to be ordering her around. Vasco replies he's 16. Daniel tries to explain that the lady has bought alcohol every day already, but, instead, the woman apologizes and calls Vasco "oppa," showing that she was actually younger than them.
When nobody was coming, Daniel began to exercise during the break. Vasco watches him, wondering why he wasn't losing any weight even though he was so diligent. Suddenly, Daniel sits down, saying he's very tired so he should replenish his energy. He starts wolfing down a hamburger. Vasco realizes the reason why Daniel can't lose any weight is because he's eating so much and orders that Daniel goes on a diet. Daniel can't stand it, and starts wondering why his other body wasn't getting fat even though they both eat the same amount. All of a sudden, he realizes the fifth truth: his other body's shape can't change.
The next day, at the cafeteria, Daniel heaps food onto his plate and wolfs it all down. Girls, seeing him, giggles and says he eats like a man. However, when Ji Ho tries to do the same thing, they call him uncivilized and dirty instead.
However, at night, Daniel realizes that, no matter how much his new body eats, his original body is still very hungry. When he goes training with Vasco in the morning, he feels weak and hungry. He takes out a banana that he had saved from before, but Vasco snatches it away, saying that he shouldn't eat it. Daniel starts to cry, and, when Vasco takes a large bite of the banana, something breaks within Daniel because, whenever Daniel is very hungry, he would lose control. He rushes at Vasco, arms flailing. Vasco tries to tell him to calm down a little, but Daniel punches him hard, and Vasco is only barely able to block it.
Episode 113
After
Daniel
punched him,
Vasco
, frantic, gets into a fighting stance, trying to tell Daniel to calm down. As Daniel lunges to punch Vasco he hits Daniel in the neck, rendering him unconscious.
Daniel wakes up in his new body, embarrassed that he had acted the way he did. He realizes that he had completely lost control and puts on his jacket to go and find Vasco and his unconscious other body. However, just as he tries to call Vasco, he sees his vision blurring again.
It turns out that Vasco, had woken him up by sticking the banana in his mouth. Apologizing and crying, he promises that Daniel can eat the banana. Daniel, realizing that his other body was now lying unconscious somewhere, tries to tell Vasco not to wake him up, only to feel himself losing consciousness again.
Daniel wakes up in his new
body to see
a girl
above him, trying to wake him up. She asks if he's alright and apologizes, saying that she saw him suddenly faint. Daniel wonders if there had been someone there earlier, but thinks nothing of it. Thinking he must have scared her, he reassures her that he's fine and thanks her. The girl suddenly retreats, apologizing for touching him, and Daniel, thinking she must be very introverted, says she shouldn't apologize and if anything he should thank her for helping him.
At that moment, Vasco rushes over crying with original Daniel on his back. He explains that he called the emergency number 102 but nobody picked up. Daniel tells him it's 120, but secretly feels relieved that it was Vasco to find his body, because he couldn't remember the number to call the ambulance. Meanwhile, the girl thinks that Daniel has fallen in love with her and that, this time, her love wasn't one
side. At the same time, she picks up the key to Daniel's room that Daniel had accidentally left behind.
In a flashback, the girl remembers her backstory. She used to have a crush on a boy called
Heemin
, but he rejected her because she was ugly. In school when she was older people would gossip about her, saying she's gloomy and that they're unlucky because they have to work in the same group with her for a project. Even now her neighbors would still gossip about her, going so far as to say that she should leave because she was bringing down the house prices. She would scratch at her arm, thinking that nobody loves her that she was very lonely.
The scene then cuts to PTJ's CEO
DG
.
Crystal
asks DG what he's plotting with her dad because her dad doesn't tell her anything. She congratulates him because he's looked happier after becoming the CEO, but he says that his good mood isn't because of his job but because his stalker finally stopped contacting him.
Daniel is working in the convenience store while a storm is going on. He thinks to himself that it would be terrible if he had lost his key in this weather, so it's lucky that he found the key outside his front door. Meanwhile, his new body sleeps at home. As the thunder rolls, the girl he had met that morning crouches in front of him, grinning.
Episode 114
Daniel wakes up the next morning to find that all the dishes in the sink were clean. He is confused because he doesn't remember cleaning the plates, but blames it all on the diet, saying that he's been rather forgetful lately. When he leaves to go to school, he sees the girl shivering outside his front door. She calls out Daniel's name and makes small talk with him. He wonders why she is sitting in the cold and realizes that she's eating something as well, but he doesn't comment on it.
She suddenly holds out her hand and asks if Daniel likes her ring, the same ring that she had shown her childhood crush. Daniel tells her it looks really pretty and asks if she's made it herself. Just when she's about to ask him another question,
Zoe
shows up, offering to walk to school with him. The girl grows jealous of Zoe, who doesn't notice and hands her a hot pack. When they leave the girl remembers how Daniel had told her to go back home and believes Daniel would love her alone. She then takes out the key to his home, saying that she'll listen to him and return to their "love nest."
When she enters Daniel's home, she says "I'm back," as if she were returning to her own home. She then smiles that hes's used her dishes, which she licks clean. The girl goes to fold the sheets, only to find original Daniel sleeping in them. She gets angry and grabs a kitchen knife to kill him.
Episode 115
At that moment Daniel arrives, coming home after a rough day. He looks around and sees that the room's suddenly become cleaner and wonders if he's hallucinating. He then notices the kitchen knife lying on the ground next to his mattress and the dishes are washed. As he takes a shower, he decides that his mother couldn't have come over and wonders if it is a manifestation of his dual bodies. Meanwhile, the stalker watches him take a shower.
As Daniel dries his hair, he walks over to his original body, slapping himself awake to get ready for work.Then, he uses his new body to continue drying his hair, saying that he doesn't want to go to work and deciding to eat before he goes. All this time, the stalker watches, wide-eyed, from behind the bathroom door.
Crystal walks by Daniel's home to see the stalker taking out the trash. She says that there are only two boys living inside that house, and asks who she is. The stalker replies that she and Daniel are one and that they are family. She then asks if Crystal is his friend. Crystal replies "ah, yes" whist wondering if the stalker is his sister. The stalker girl, angered by this reply, asks if they are close, and Crystal is scared and answers no.
Meanwhile, at Daniel's convenience store, Zoe is speculating whether or not the girl is stalking Daniel because she says she'd seen her before too, but hadn't paid much attention. She says that, now that she
thinks about it, it seems kinda strange and wonders if the girl might have entered Daniel's home. At that moment, Crystal barges in worriedly, sweating from running. Crystal and Zoe both wonder who the other is, because they keep seeing each other around original Daniel. When he asks if she needs anything, Crystal replies that she's not there to buy anything but wants to know if he has a sister. He rushes home, scared, and looks around, only to find nobody there.
The next day, Daniel tapes pieces of tape to the door, and, when he rushes home, realizes that they hadn't been touched, showing nobody had opened the door during the day. He pushes the door open, and sees nothing has been touched and everything was just as messy as before. He rushes to the sink and is incredibly relieved to realize that the dishes hadn't been washed either.
In a moment of dramatic irony, the scene cuts to a cockroach, and then zooms out to show that it was crawling on the stalker girl's face as she lies in the space under the kitchen sink, grinning and saying that, as long as she's able to see Daniel, she would be happy. As she lies under the sink, she sees original Daniel slap his new body to get ready for school, and wonders why, whenever he switches bodies, one of them falls unconscious. She grins creepily as she realizes that it means that she should be able to take one of them.
Episode 116
The next morning, Daniel and Crystal see each other while jogging. Crystal asks him whether he comes exercising everyday after work. Daniel replies yes, and that he exercises with a friend (Vasco) every morning before going home. Crystal, finding something in common, exclaims that she also often exercises as well. Daniel looks at her suspiciously, wondering if she's bragging about staying in shape. At the same time Crystal thinks that original Daniel is kind, fond of small animals, determined, and hard working, and wonders why someone as good as him would live with someone like new Daniel.
She asks Daniel whether the stalker's been coming around anymore lately, and he replies that no, she hasn't, and thanks Crystal for helping, but asks how she knew which place was his. Crystal, not wanting to reveal that she's been investigating him under orders of her father, explains that she saw it when she came over to feed Enu. The stalker angrily wonders who she is and decides she must have her eyes on new Daniel and wants to steal him away.
Zoe comes over right afterwards, asking if he'd seen the stalker again and offering to walk to school with him. She then notices how the place where Daniel lives isn't really fancy so she asks what Daniel's parents do. He answers that his mother does a little of everything and Zoe mistakenly believes that his mother's in charge of a huge company that dabbles in a bit of everything and is incredibly impressed. Unbeknownst to them, the stalker watches them from within Daniel's room, and thinks that Zoe is there to seduce Daniel as well. She wonders when the permission form will be sent to her, and frantically check her cell phone only to smile when she realizes that it's just been approved.
While at school, Daniel tells his classmates about his stalker. Zoe offers to walk with Daniel to school every morning, and says it'll be great if original Daniel comes along as well. Jay suddenly hands Daniel a utility knife and tells him to keep it. Daniel doesn't know why Jay is handing it to him but accepts. As he looks down at his hands he sees the ring the stalker had on, and realized that it must have been put onto him while he was asleep, showing that the girl was still in his home.
Frantically, he runs back home and realizes that his original body had disappeared. He looks all over the place for a sign of the stalker. When he checks the space under the kitchen sink, he realizes that, although nobody was there, there were a lot of soiled adult diapers. The stalker girl appears behind him and tasers him.
Episode 117
When Daniel wakes up, he finds that he isn't in pain and realizes that he's in his original body, but he can't move because he's been bound. The stalker is seen coming out of the bath, talking to an unconscious Daniel. She says that the two of them can live together forever, and that she's put the "annoying pig" in a place where nobody would ever find him.
Meanwhile, original Daniel tries to scream under the tape on his mouth and flails in his bonds. He tries rolling around and falls onto the ground. Suddenly, he feels something sharp and starts to use it to cut at his bonds. When he is finally able to take off his blindfold and open his eyes, he finds himself in a room that is covered with his own photographs. He realizes he'd fallen out of the closet full of wine bottles, and the sharp object he had used to cut off the ropes was actually a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After wondering for a while what he should do, he decides to run to the police office.
The policeman, upon hearing his story, are surprised at hearing his story and commends him for running to report it immediately. When Daniel gives his address, the first policeman tells Daniel to wait a moment because the address Daniel had given was an hour away from the police station, which didn't fit with Daniel's story that he had directly ran to the police office after he saw the crime. The police then comments on how Daniel smells of alcohol, and decides he must be drunk. When Daniel replies he hadn't drank, the police admonish him for lying and begin interrogating him.
Suddenly, Daniel loses consciousness as his other body wakes to find himself bound to a chair with his arms behind his back. They're in another room that's also covered with pictures of himself, and there's a circle of candles surrounding them. He asks her why she's doing this to him, to which she replies that they are one. She explains that this is their new home, and she'd specially decorated it for him, and that there were even some couple photos of them. She also explains that she's eating his fingernails and toenails as a snack, which she ate earlier when Daniel saw her outside his door.
Daniel exclaims that she can't do this, that she'd also kidnapped his "friend" and that this was illegal. However, the stalker only turns around, grinning, saying that she knew his "little secret".
Episode 118
The stalker girl reveals that she knew about the fact that Daniel had two bodies, and that he changes by slapping himself. Daniel doesn't correct her, and decides to figure out where he is. When she refuses to tell him, he says that he won't marry her. The stalker is angry, thinking he's lying to her, and tasers him again.
When Daniel wakes up in his original body, he's still in the police station, and the police still think he's lying. He asks Crystal for help. The police promise to help and are very reverent towards Crystal because it turns out she's very close to the department head. When Crystal asks how Daniel had contacted her without a cell phone, he explains he'd sent a message to original Crystal and asked her to pass the message on. Crystal offers to help find new Daniel, and Daniel thanks her and leaves, saying he's already found a lead.
Crystal calls
Kouji
and tells him to locate Daniel's cellphone. The Kouji tells her that he's not going to do it, but Crystal only tells him Daniel's phone number and hangs up. She looks incredibly angry and says that nobody should bully her Daniel.
Original Daniel, on the other hand, heads to a telephone stand where he calls the number of the noodle restaurant where the stalker had called for takeaway. He'd memorized the phone number of the restaurant while tied up in his new body. He asks the restaurant to tell him the address of the woman who'd called for two bowls of noodles. However, when the restaurant owner hears his request, he seems to mistake Daniel for a stalker instead and hangs up.
Crystal had already gotten the address from the Kouji through text. He tells her that it's a good thing Daniel's cell phone was still on, and tells her she shouldn't go alone and should bring Gun with her. She replies that Gun had went with Goo out of the country, and that it was an emergency, so she can deal with any danger by herself. The Kouji replies that it's true, she isn't pretty when she gets mad either, and tells her that it's free this time, but he wants her to think over his last request some more. As she gets closer to the address the Kouji's sent her, Crystal starts to get a little scared. However, when she arrives, she starts because she realizes she's been here before.
Episode 119
The stalker girl appears behind Crystal, and tasers her, believing she is there to seduce Daniel. She ties her up in a chair next to Daniel, saying that they should settle this dispute between themselves before “her husband” wakes up. Crystal then says that she knows the stalker, because she was also DG's stalker. The stalker asks if Crystal is talking about her ex-boyfriend, and says that she seems to have an interest in all of the stalker's past boyfriends. She continues to say that Crystal can have DG because she is already married now. The stalker's wearing a headdress, a white dress, and holding flowers, but Crystal realizes that the headdress is actually lace underwear and the stalker’d made the wedding dress herself.
Crystal asks her if she knows what she's doing. After all, she'd already kidnapped 3 people already. The stalker laughs and tells Crystal how she'd always been discriminated against because of her looks, but immediately starts talking about how a pig (original Daniel) would dare to sleep in her spot without even realizing how unfit he is. Crystal points out this discrepancy, telling the stalker that, even though she blames society's lookism, she herself is only attracted to handsome guys. Angered, the stalker lunges forward to taser her, only for original Daniel to walk in through the door.
In a flashback, original Daniel had continued to call the noodle restaurant, telling the owner that he was trying to help a friend who was in danger. The owner, hearing that he was trying to help a friend, changes his mind about the matter extremely quickly and tells Daniel the address. To his surprise, it turned out to be his home.
The stalker asks how he changed bodies when she hadn't slapped him, and Crystal is surprised to hear this. Daniel wants to use his strength to defeat the stalker, but the stalker throws a candle at him, and, when he's dodging the candle she tasers him. He falls unconscious and wakes up in his new body. Meanwhile, Crystal starts crying for the stalker to stop hurting original Daniel while the stalker continues to electrocute his unconscious body. She calls the girl a stalker, and the stalker tries to taser her but Daniel takes the hit, telling her not to hurt Crystal. The stalker begins to hit Daniel repeatedly until he is covered with blood.
She then tells him he should apologize, because then she'll forgive him, but she doesn't know he is only buying time for Crystal to escape while handing her Jay's utility knife. However, even though Crystal's hand was on the door knob, she hesitates to leave him behind.
Episode 120
The stalker noticed Daniel looking in her direction and launches herself at her, taser out. The scene cuts to
Gun
who is on the phone with the
Kouji
. He tells him that Crystal had left alone, and worried for her, had phoned Gun to ask when he was coming back from overseas. Gun says he's coming back soon, and that Goo was still having a lot of fun beating someone up. He continued to say that he isn't worried about
her because he'd taught her some moves earlier.
Crystal kicks the stalker's head,causing blood to come out of the stalker's mouth. She says that this is a lot less than Daniel had to suffer and locks the door, telling the stalker to prepare to have her ass handed to her. The stalker cries and tries to squeeze Crystal but she aims her elbow at the stalker's back, incapacitating her in one blow. As the stalker falls to the ground, Crystal uses the taser to electrocute her. Daniel, thanks her, and she asks him why he'd let her go earlier. When he replies that it's because she's a girl, she continues to say that the stalker's a girl too, and tells him to stop judging people based on their looks. She realizes this may be the first time they’d seen each other for who they were inside.
The police had arrived and had put the stalker in handcuffs. As the stalker is led to the police car, she cries for her "husband", trying to explain that her "husband" had two bodies. Meanwhile, the people around her snicker, saying she's lost her mind. Daniel smiles, thinking that nobody would believe the stalker's words, but, behind him, Crystal, wide-eyed, seems to realize the truth.
Epilogue
The stalker girl asks two guys if they like her ring, and they answer that it's really pretty, if she made it herself, and that she was very good with her hands. They ask her if she has an accessories shop and where it's open. It turns out that the stalker had become really pretty. While in prison, she met a girl who had kept some makeup from the guards, realized the stalker girl could become really pretty, and taught her to apply makeup. When the stalker girl leaves prison, she uses the new technique to look beautiful, and she suddenly realizes that everyone's asking her for contact information and even offering her jobs. The story ends with the girl from prison telling her the moral that who you are inside doesn't matter because, in this world, everyone only cares about appearances.
Cookie
In the cookie we see a teacher in the staff room talking to someone about how close they were to becoming a Sophomore & finishing their first year, it's then revealed that the student the teacher was talking to was in fact
Logan Lee
, who wants to transfer due to a fight.
Notes
When the police are speaking to Crystal they use the term "千金" in Chinese, which refers to a girl close enough to be your daughter.

—Stalker Girl  in
episode TBA
The Stalker Girl
(her real name isn't revealed) is a minor character who appears in Episode 104.
Since her name remains unknown she is referred to as the
Stalker Girl
. She is a
sasaeng fan
, meaning, an over-obsessive fan of a Korean idol, or other public figure, that has engaged in stalking or other behavior that constitutes an invasion of privacy.
[
3
]
Appearance
She has medium length black hair, which is usually uncombed. She has a set of black eyes. She has a huge forehead and is generally considered by others as ugly. She also has a slim figure, due to which many people mockingly called her,
The Skeleton
.
However, while in prison, another prisoner taught her to use makeup. As a result, she currently has bangs and her makeup enhances her beauty due to which many people found her attractive.
Personality
As she is a sasaeng fan, she has engaged in behaviors such as stalking and various other criminal acts that invades privacy. She is over-obsessed with one or the other idol, and collects a lot of pictures and information regarding any particular idol, whom she considers her boyfriend. She is hypocritical as she only cares about good looking guys when she herself resents people who only cares about looks. She is also a person who is extremely jealous of other people "stealing" her "boyfriend" away from her. She acts very violently to others and has an overall disgusting personality. Her behaviour, like all sasaeng fans, is extremely disturbing.
Relationships
DG
She was one of DG's sasaeng fans and considered him as her boyfriend. She "broke up" with him when she came to know about Daniel Park. However, he was absolutely terrified of her and was relieved when she stopped stalking him.
Daniel Park
The stalker girl tries to marry Daniel Park.
She first appears in Episode 104, as one of the fans waiting for DG to walk out of PTJ Entertainment. That's when she first saw Daniel Park, who was running after DG to know how DG knew about the convenience store. Since then, she has been obsessed with him and collected many of his pictures and tried to get as many as information she could about him. She completely covered her room with photographs of him and somehow narrowed down his location.
She did several disturbing actions, which include basically living in his house without him knowing, believing that Daniel and herself are one. She even tried to marry him, and tired to forcefully make him marry her.
Synopsis
Background
As a result of her appearance, she was continually insulted by most people around her.  She grew to be a sad and dejected person. Because of this, she tended to be reserved and shut herself away from others.
She used to be a sasaeng fan of
DG
, who was terrified of her. She, however, believed that they were in a relationship.
Stalker Arc
DG mentions her in Episode 113 when he talks to
Crystal Choi
and  says that the reason he looks happy is because she stopped stalking him. He mentions that she's more of a crazed stalker than a fan.
She first meets
Daniel Park
when he runs to meet
Euntae Lee
who has his old body. Daniel falls unconscious on the street as Eun Tae had tried to shake his old body. The stalker girl sees Daniel and she shakes him up. He thanks her as he rushes to Eun Tae. As he goes, his key falls off his pocket and the stalker obtains it.
Later it cuts to dark when she comes inside Daniel's house and watches him sleep. The next day, she asked him if he's heading to school and he begins to think if she's lives in his neighborhood.
The stalker girl shows Daniel Park her ring.
She then begins to raise her hand up high and shows him her ring and asks his opinion on it. He then smiles and asks if she made it herself, to which she begins to smile and thinks of him as the type she wants.
Then
Park Ha Neul
arrives to go with Daniel to school. The stalker girl begins to speculate if she has a crush on Daniel and, in her mind, insults her.
She believes that she belongs to Daniel and him only, and that no one should separate them. She takes the key to his apartment and goes inside, She is obsessed with everything he has ever touched, from his leftover meal, to his body odor. She then begins to do the dishes inside Daniel's house, and licks off the plate he was eating food in.
The stalker girl finds Daniel's original body sleeping.
She later finds Daniel's old body sleeping and then realizes that the “pig” Ha Neul was talking about was actually his original body.
After she kidnaps Daniel's original body and locks him in her cupboard of her house, she goes to her own house completely redecorates it.
Later, she holds him (Daniel's new body) hostage on a chair full of cut-off pictures of the stalker girl with Daniel himself, in his own house.
The stalker girl holds Daniel and Soo Jung hostage.
When Soo Jung comes to investigate and help Daniel, she manages to kidnap her too and also holds her hostage. When she tries to harm Soo Jung, Daniel steps in the way. Unbeknownst to her, he uses the box cutter that
Hong Jae Yeol
had lent him to free Soo Jung.
While the stalker was distracted and harming Daniel, he looks at Soo Jung, hoping she would get away as soon as possible. However, the stalker girl notices this and tries to fight Soo Jung. They both engage in a fight.
In the end, she gets arrested. In prison she meets a prisoner who teaches her how to use makeup to make her look attractive. When she gets released, she uses her fellow prisoner's tips and is able to look attractive, hence gaining the attention of many men.

Trivia
It is revealed she went to the same kindergarten or school with
Kim Heemin
. Her first memory was Heemin telling her not to talk to him after making a ribbon ring for him.
If she was in Heemin's grade and not just in his kindergarten, then she should be 22 years old, as Heemin himself is 22.
Other than the
HNH Chairman
and
Jiho Park
, the stalker girl is the only one to know Daniel Park's secret. The difference being that she and Jiho had figured it out while the HNH Chairman knew it from the beginning.

Joy Hong
,
[
1
]
and Charles Choi regarding his relation to the four crews.
Charles Choi
describes him, "That old fart's just good at figuring out hints,"
[
2
]
insinuating that Steve Hong is much smarter than he presents himself to be.
He has been shown to have a soft side for those he is not necessarily close to. He cares that his bodyguards are trained to be respectful, and not to be seen as mobsters.
[
1
]

A freshman in high school, Joy Hong is Steve Hong's only known daughter. There is no interpretation of their status regarding each other, other than the fact that Steve looked into the waypoint of her impersonators.
Kitae Hong
Kitae Hong is Steve's first son in the family. Kitae is the Chairman of a theme park, and likely that he gained his status because of his father's position.

Eugene
After being invited to a personal meeting, Steve arrives to listen to Engune's offer. Eugene discovers that "Detective Hong," whom Daniel mentioned, is actually the chairman of H Group. Eugene proposes to take down Charles Choi together. Although initially declined, Steve sees Engune's determined potential as a young chairman like he once was and recognizing Charles's vulnerabilities. Consequently, he accepts to empower Eugene.
Other
Charles Choi
He and Steve are both CEOs, and they have known each other for a long time, but are not friends.
[

[
1
]

Charles Choi
to be the one behind the minors causing issues, and confronts him.
[
2
]
A minor altercation ensued between Charles Choi and himself causing him to confirm his suspicion that Charles is behind the major 4 gangs. This leads him to start to investigate Charles which leads him the Daniel Park's home (was previously Charles Choi's home).
Daniel Park VS Gun
Steve is going hunting, and he catches a bird. He says that even though the bird thinks that he can run away, it'll always be in the palm of his hands. Charles says that it sounds like Steve is talking about him, but Steve denies it.
Steve talks about the news, and says that the incident with Hostel was broadcasted. He looks at Charles and says that he thinks the gangs are funding a business. Charles shoots, nearly missing Steve's head, and he says that he saw a racoon behind him. Steve does the same, and when Charles asks if he saw a raccoon too, Steve says that he didn't, and was actually aiming for Charles. The two continue walking as if nothing happened.
Steve says that Charles used to work as a janitor, and then he started a business the year after he left. He asks who Charles met during that time.

—Sujin Kim  in
episode 497
Sujin Kim
was the love interest of
Vin Jin
.
Appearance
Sujin Kim's hair is black and wavy, the length of her hair goes down to her mid-back.
She knows no martial arts, as seen from her struggles during the Cheonliang Arc.
Personality
She is quite curious, as she witnessed the Shaman's attacks on Vin Jin's mother, and interjected when
Seongji Yook
tried to make kimchi.
She is good at many housekeeping services, including cooking, cleaning, laundry, and running errands.
Relationships
TBA
Synopsis
She first met
Vin Jin's mother
when she was 7, who doted on her due to her young age, giving her candy and such. She would unfortunately witness one of Cheon Shinmyung's sexual assaults on the woman, who tried to wave it off as them practicing judo.
The next time Shinmyung assaulted the woman, she protested and was murdered for it, a sight the young girl would unfortunately be a witness to as well.
Seven years later, she met Vin Jin by entering his home while he was sleeping, and when he brought the girl to the
Cheonliang Fam
, she would beg for them to take her in by offering her services as a maid. They develop a platonic relationship, which was going into a romantic relationship, before she got kidnapped by
Taejin Cheon
and got murdered by him. Taejin did not know what to do with her so he left her beside an unconscious
Seongji Yook
. Vin Jin found both Seongji Yook and Sujin Kim. He assumed Seongji was the one who harmed Sujin and rushed her to the hospital, to no avail. Seongji, who thought he killed Sujin while in his delirious state, drowned himself out of guilt.
Fighting Prowess
As a civilian raised as a maid for Taejin Cheon, she likely possessed no fighting abilities.

"
It’s so damn peaceful here
"
—Taegon Wi
Taegon Wi
is one of the four executives at the Workers third affiliate.
Appearance
TBA
Personality
TBA
Relationships
Eli Jang
Taegon respected Eli enough to use his staff against him. His fight with Eli was one of the best he's had in Korea.
Synopsis
History
Taegon Wi grew up without a family in China. He was targeted by kidnappers as a kid, and he did whatever he could to survive. When he became older he was approached by Xiaolong who offered him a position. Although he has been in Korea for some time, he hasn’t found any opponents as strong as those in China.
[
1
]
In the past, Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest of the Workers 3rd affiliate executives by fighting. He chose to spar with Ho Hwang because in his opinion he was obviously the strongest of the four.
[
2
]
Taegon Wi, also known as "King Gon", had fought with
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
before. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it.
[
3
]
Club Arc
Taegon Wi first appeared when Vivi explained to him the rape ring she hosts for her friends. Taegon threw a kunai at Daniel. Then he chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.
[
4
]
Workers (3 Affiliates)
Taegon Wi was originally tasked with monitoring Jake Kim, who was going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well.
[
5
]
Taegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli’s staff away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.
Quotes
It’s so damn peaceful here
Strength is proportional to unhappiness. That’s what got me this far. Why couldn’t I beat you even though I was so miserable?

YOU LOOKIN DOWN ON CHEONLIANG!?
"
—Taejin Cheon
Taejin Cheon (천태진  Chun Tae Jin)
is the Workers First Affiliate Director as well as the CEO of the Private-use First Responders. He was the second shaman of Cheonliang after Shinmyung Cheon.
Appearance
Taejin is a tall man with a muscular physique, he has short, dyed blonde hair. He usually wears a formal designer outfit with a black dress shirt and a gold-colored vest with black prints. He sometimes wears a Cheonliang uniform. He also has a large scar in the middle of his chest.
Personality
Taejin has a cold-blooded personality, hardly showing reactions, always acting in a "professional" way. However, in
Vin Jin
's flashback
[
1
]
, he shows a hot-blooded countenance, mocking Vin.
Relationships
Workers
Hangyeoul Baek
As the director of 1st Affiliate, Taejin shows respect, getting even more serious in the presence of CEO Hangyeoul Baek.
Cheongliang Fam
Vin Jin
Having previously thought Taejin dead, Vin Jin hates Taejin so much that he crushed the controls of an arcade machine upon finding out otherwise, and joined Allied solely to see him again, and presumably get his revenge by killing Taejin. It is also stated that Taejin assaulted and killed Sujin Kim, as seen in the flashback.
Mary Kim
Having previously thought Taejin dead, Mary Kim harbors such hatred for Taejin that she wanted to kill him upon finding out otherwise, even crying upon receiving the news.
Sujin Kim
During his childhood, Taejin fell in love with Sujin Kim and claimed her as his "property." After Taejin's father's death, he went to Vin Jin's residence and kidnapped Sujin Kim. As Sujin Kim ran away from him, they reached a tree with colorful strings attached to it. It was there that Taejin lost control and strangled Sujin Kim to death. After her death, he only thought about how her death would make him a murderer and he had to find a way to get rid of her body. Which he did by putting her beside an unconscious
Seongji Yuk
.
Synopsis
The only child of Cheongliang's shaman, he first met Vin Jin when they were both 8 when he promised that Vin would be afforded more luxuries once he inherited his father's position.
Fighting Prowess
The only fight we have from him is a part in
Vin Jin
's flashback, which suggests he's on the same strength level as Vin Jin.
In Chapter 462 it is shown that Taejin is greater than what he was in his flashback fight against Vin Jin, as the current Vin Jin (but you can say that Vin Jin wasn't going all out as he told the
Allied
crew to leave as he doesn't want any witnesses) going for the kill slammed Taejin's face down to the ground breaking apart the concrete floor, then Taejin shook off Vin Jin's hand (who has monstrous grip strength) and smiled maniacally saying that he is "Really Really Really Looking Forward to it". His durability is also great as even when his face was slammed into the ground, his teeth and face remained intact.
As the former leader of the former business model of the Workers' First Affiliate, he survived in a hell of constant fighting, and was strong enough to become the leader.
As of Chapter 464 Taejin Cheon has completely defeated Vin Jin and it was effortless even though Taejin stated that Vin Jin was stronger than he was in the past. Taejin is strong and fast enough to overpower Vin Jin's grip strength (which was enough to uproot trees from the ground and stated that Vin Jin got stronger since then) with his very own grip strength and was overpowering Vin Jin when it came to a contest of strength (when they were wrestling) and took an onslaught of attacks and was dodging and blocking effortlessly while talking trash and explaining what he has been doing since he was gone to Vin Jin. Taejin is also durable enough to take full power attacks from Vin Jin to the face and have no reaction while blood isn't even drawn or wasn't even swelling as after gripping Vin Jin's face and knocking him out completely defeating him, Taejin was on the phone to (presumably
Gitae Kim
) explaining that he let Allied forces through and fought Vin Jin as to make it not look suspicious (hinting towards that the only reason Taejin fought wasn't for revenge on Vin Jin it was to actually not raise suspicion on himself while letting the Allied crew in) there was not markings, bruising, blood on Taejin at all, only on Vin Jin while the area around was broken and indented.
Quotes
I'm from the country, too. A place called
Cheonliang
Trivia
He has killed people before.
He is seen to be extremely possessive, wanting to make both Vin Jin and Kim Sujin his "possessions".
He is the sole survivor of "Hell", an underground battle royale that came before the 1st Affiliate.
He used to have black hair, dying it yellow after, probably to show his affirmation to Goo Kim.
The scar across his torso was given by Vin Jin, where he ripped the skin off Taejin's chest with his grip strength.
He tries his best to not look weak, even when he is in utter danger.

—Taejoon Park  in
episode TBA
Taejoon Park (박태준
Pak Tae Joon
)
is a minor character and an Architecture student at
J High.
Appearance
Taejoon is a short male student with pale skin and black hair. He is found to be rather unattractive by many others, being the reason of why he is often treated harshly and disrespectfully. His facial features consist of relatively thick eyebrows, dark-coloured eyes which tilt upwards, various layers of fat in his chin and pimples and warts on his cheeks. Taejoon also intentionally styled his hair like
Vasco
before shaving it afterwards.
Personality
Taejoon is obsessed with becoming famous and would usually go to extreme measures to gain the attention from others. He looks at famous 'Pacebook' stars and well-known broadcasters with respect and admiration as he dreams of 'rubbing shoulders with them'. Afterwards, it is found that Taejoon only wants attention because he wants to feel like people actually think that he is worth something and he only wishes to be an attention-seeker because he wants favorable attention, not the unwanted attention he receives from bullies and gossipers. He is notorious for his lying, and often called "Taejoon Park, the Liar".
After comparing Taejoon's attitude to when he was striving for attention to when he had Vasco come over to his house,
Jace
realised that Taejoon looked more genuinely happy when Vasco came over because he actually had a friend who believed him about his small dog.

"
I like to draw ever since I was a child. When I was 6-7 years old, I liked to copy the comics that my mother gave me. I've taken comic majors but I’ve quit since I couldn't afford it at that time. Subsequently then. I tried many jobs; from doing business online, modeling and staring in variety shows. But my interest in illustrating. rebound when I found Line Webtoon. This digital platform facilitates anyone to take part in and it has a wider medium to draw. Thus, I decided to create this Comic from my Past experiences in school.

"
I don't care about becoming the strongest. I do not fight to win. There is only one reason to use my fist, it's because I'm a man.
"
—Taesoo Ma to Beolgu Lee  in
episode 494
Taesoo Ma
is the former King of Ansan, and one of the Kings of the 1st Generation.
Appearance
Taesoo Ma is a muscular, tall, hulking man. He has black, messy, medium-length hair that is held back by a black headband. He has a rugged face paired with facial hair, he has a missing right eye and a scar in that area. His missing eye is a result of his fight with James Lee years ago and is now replaced with a removable fake eye.
Personality
Taesoo Ma was a man with a strong belief, believing that using his right hand was manly and admirable. This belief slowly faded away after his fight with James Lee. He then started to train and use his left hand in hopes of beating James Lee/DG, discarding the belief of using his right hand.
Despite his appearance, he can be quite caring as shown with his interactions and relationship with Hudson Ahn. He also prides himself as a member of the 1st Generation, boastfully stating that the 2nd Generation was not comparable to the 1st Generation.
He likes to be out in the wilderness so much that he
bought an entire mountain
just to hunt on it.
Relationships
Ansan Public
Taesoo Ma seems to have a teacher-alumni relationship with the leader of the
Ansan Public
,
Hudson Ahn
. Taesoo Ma had seemed to be pestered by Hudson to teach him how to become as strong as him as Taesoo was considered the "King of Ansan" when Hudson was younger. Hudson seems to have met him around the age of 16, Hudson learned from Taesoo that he uses his right arm in fighting and only uses the left when needed. It seems Taesoo left Ansan in Hudson's care and Hudson thinks very highly of his "Master" Taesoo Ma.
1st Generation
Na Chaegyeon
Taesoo and Chaegyeon have been shown to have an extremely bitter relationship, with Chaegyeon attempting to hit Taesoo with his car upon seeing him.
Fighting Prowess
Taesoo's unorthodox fighting style comes from his philosophy, to be a "man". He fought with only his right fist, which is so strong that James Lee and Daniel Park were unable to parry, and gave Daniel the fear of his arms breaking off. It was also able to cause Beolgoo Lee  to bald. After his defeat by the hands of James Lee, Taesoo trained his whole body, including his left hand, abandoning his principles, this caused him to deteriorate and be humiliated yet again at the feet of James Lee in the One Night arc.
After Taesoo realised he had betrayed his principles and lead as a bad example to Hudson, he got his act back together and retrained himself, developing the Ultimate Fist.
Ultimate Fist
After training his whole body, Taesoo uses every single muscle in his body to use one strike, one that encompasses both Strength and Speed Mastery, to deal devastating damage to his opponent. This is his trump card only to be used against the strongest of opponents, such as James Lee.
Quotes
Good. Come at me with sincerity. Then I’ll be sincere too. Let’s have fun like we had in the first generation!
[

]
-Taesoo
Chapter 366
I abandoned my faith and chose anger. It didn’t matter. If I could beat you…
[

]
There’s one thing I still have left. That is my rage to kill you
[

]
You’re going to feel the same despair that I felt
[

]
Believe in yourself. Strong faith. If you don’t start off believing in yourself, you’ll never beat anyone.
[

]
I do not fight to be the strongest, I do not fight to win. There is only one reason why I use my fist: It is because I am a Man

Synopsis
Episode 481
This arc starts off with
Diego Kang
making a deal with
Eugene,
offering a USB containing evidence of
Charles Choi
kidnapping
Gyeoul Baek
in exchange for
Jinyeong Park's
location.
Eugene
tells him
Jinyeong
has lost his mind.
Diego Kang
is no longer interested, He then confesses to killing
Gapryong Kim
, saying he doesn't deserve to see
Jinyeong
. When
Eugene
asks about
"The King of Seoul,"
because those words triggered the most violent reaction from
Jinyeong
,
Diego Kang
refuses to answer and urges him to focus on
Charles Choi
instead.
Eugene
reveals he's waiting to hand over the USB because he needs one final piece of evidence. He has sent
Daniel Park
to Cheonliang to uncover
Charles Choi’s
weakness,
Daniel
encounters the
1st Generation Kings
attending the funeral of
Cheonliang’s original king,
marking the anniversary of his death. At the funeral,
Vin Jin
is also present, along with the rest of the
Cheonliang Fam.
A flashback then occurs, showing
Vin Jin
being sacrificed.

Episode 347
DG
confiscates the cookies from
Daniel
and is too fast for him to take them back. He feels Daniel up and recognizes that he is Daniel Park. Daniel is surprised because he hasn't met him in the little body. DG asks Daniel if his secret move was taught by
Sophia Alexander
. DG eventually decides to give the cookies back to Daniel because he intends to meet
Steve Hong
himself. He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know. Daniel returns the cookies to Steve Hong, who is disappointed. Steve tells him that he won't reveal this to the public, because
Vivi
is the daughter of the chairman of T Group. He tells Daniel not to waste his money, because he will need it for the second affiliate.
Vivi and
Xiaolong
are living in rural China where
Goo
dropped them off. Vivi tells Xiaolong that if they keep a low profile, eventually her father will approve of their relationship. They say they love each other, and Xiaolong asks for Vivi to fetch him a blanket. Waiting for him is one of T Group's Cheon guards, Jiou Jeon, who takes Xiaolong away while stating there is no way for the two of them to be together. Vivi returns to find him gone.
Zoe
tells Daniel that he looks similar to his second body now that his baby fat is gone. They are interrupted by
Arin
who is now a Kwitch streamer. Zoe is jealous and calls Daniel a player.
Back at the hotel,
Eli
tells
Sally
that Xiaolong and Vivi were in love with each other, and she feels envious of their romance.
Warren
sneaks up on her with his ninja skills he learned from
Manager Kim
. Warren tells Eli that he brought a letter addressed to him. In the letter,
Olly Wang
invites everyone in Hostel.
Episode 348
Hostel
deliberates over the letter, and
Eli
decides they will go regardless of whether it is a trap. They arrive at the meeting place, which looks just like
Sally's
hotel building. When they arrive,
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
are there to greet them. They accuse Sally of being the cause of
Olly's
death, and Eli tells them to direct their ire towards him, the leader. The next to arrive are
Big Deal
, who look more intimidating than before.
Johan
from
God Dog
arrived before both gangs, and is sitting in the shade of a staircase.
Jerry
tells Chuck that he had better not be calling Jake out for no reason, and he is surprised to see
a black guy
behind him who is even taller than him.
Samuel
finds this amusing, and Jake asks if
Workers
got an invitation as well. Samuel reveals that they were behind it, and Jake says the workers leader will probably hide behind his phone again, but the leader corrects him as he walks down. The crew heads are surprised by how innocent he looks, and he introduces himself as
Eugene.
Episode 349
Eugene
tells the crews they should stop fighting each other.
Charles Choi
has used them for long enough and is planning to cut loose ends, possibly harming them in the process. However, the
Workers
know Choi's weakness. Eugene offers to protect the crews in return for helping take down Choi, and he offers 1 billion won.
Jason Yoon
asks what the Workers have to gain from this, and Eugene says they don't need the crews, they just want to get rid of loose ends. Eugene directs his offer to
Big Deal
and
Jake
accepts to fulfill his promise to
Samuel
.
Hostel
flat refuses the offer, saying they are family first. Eugene compliments their stupidity and Warren walks over to him.
A guy in a cap
stands behind
Warren
menacingly before Eugene calls him off. Warren notices he is wearing a black badge, and
Sally
brings him back.
Eugene then asks
Johan
if he would like to join the Workers. Johan asks if he knew about the Pungsan drugs, and Eugene says he ran the ring with
Vivi
. Johan feints a punch and tells Eugene he will never join a gang, and he only arrived to beat Eugene in front of everyone. Eugene asks Johan why he missed his shot, and reveals that Johan missed because he can't see where Eugene is standing. The crew heads are shocked to learn of Johan's poor eyesight. He backs away but the Workers surround him so he can't leave.
Episode 350
Eugene
tells the crews he expected these results, but it doesn't matter, because any crew that doesn't side with him will be eliminated.
Mandeok
punches
Johan
into the ground as he says this.
Warren
gets angry and decides to fight the Workers, but
Jerry
gets up to defend them and the two start fighting.
Eli
tells
Max
and
Derrick
to protect
Sally
, and
Jason
and
Brad
start fighting the two of them. They say they won't attack
Sally
.
Jake
tells Eli he has no hard feelings towards Hostel, but he must protect his own. Eli gives him a collar choke but
Samuel
steps on him, causing him to fall on Jake's face. Jake lets Samuel and Eli fight and is annoyed that Eugene is just watching all of this. He sits out of the fight and so does
the guy wearing a cap
. Johan is being choked by Mandeok when
Zack Lee
comes out of nowhere and kicks Mandeok in the head, dropping him.
Vasco
uses
Brekdak's
fifth move (a kick) on Jake. Eugene reveals that he sent a letter to the
Burn Knuckles
, but he wasn't sure if they would arrive. Everyone grows silent and fearful when
Daniel Park
enters the building, and he wonders why everyone is putting pressure on him.
Justin
and
Chuck
attack Daniel saying this time the outcome will be different, and Daniel spins and slams both of them out of the way.
Episode 351
Samuel
and
Eli
are grappling. Eli asks Samuel why he is holding back, and Samuel asks Eli what he wants. The chart he was looking at earlier with
Jin Jang
was the chart of crew heads he had to get on his side.
Jake
tells
Vasco
that he shouldn't change and become a bad guy, and Vasco rejects this notion, preparing to slam him with elbows.
Eugene
tells
Mandeok
to test
Daniel
, but
Zack
interrupts and starts monologuing about how he loses despite trying his best. Mandeok punches him but Zack gets up as though nothing happened, saying it is comical how often he fights without winning. He then does an instinctual spin that Daniel recognizes from his ultra instinct mode. Zack tells Mandeok the reason he keeps losing is because he tried to get rid of negative emotions, when he should have gotten rid of all emotion entirely. Eugene tells Mandeok to ask his name, and Zack introduces himself as a wimp. Daniel takes the chance to lunge at Eugene, but
the guy in the cap
stops him. Daniel senses that he is the strongest one there.
Episode 352
At his private high school,
Eugene
mentions it has been three years since he met with
Charles Choi
and the others to start
the four crews
. He thanks
Mandeok
and
the guy in the cap
for protecting him like
Gun
and
Goo
have protected Choi, and calls them his friends. He is surprised
Zack
hasn't gone down yet, and also by how dirty Zack is fighting. He is doing all kinds of underhanded tactics like headbutting, hitting below the belt, and pivot blows: the tells of dirty boxing. Eugene tells them to stop fighting because Zack passed his test.
Jake
asks
Vasco
if he is really going to do a move that could kill someone, and Vasco tells him that he was the reason Vasco ended up this way.
Jerry
intercepts his elbow blows but injures his hand from the force.
Warren
left the fight with Jerry early because he was disappointed Jerry would not fight with all of his strength. They all stop fighting to watch
Daniel
fighting with the guy in the cap. Daniel's systema is barely keeping up with the other guy's speed. He tries to do a spinning kick but the guy grabs hold of him and pins him to the ground. Eugene tells Daniel he wants to talk to him, and he will tell him about
James Lee
in return.
Episode 353
Daniel
tries to act as though he doesn't care about
James Lee
but
Eugene
calls him out, saying he must be interested in the identity he was given. He says he will tell Daniel more about James Lee if he joins the
Workers
, since Daniel could be useful in defeating
Choi
. Daniel refuses, saying he has seen too much about the Workers to ever work with them.
Johan
regains his vision and kicks
Mandeok
, asking
Zack
why he decided to help. Zack says he doesn't remember the reason, and Johan decides to help him fight.
Hostel
have united with
God Dog
and J High, and
Big Deal
have united with the Workers. Eugene asks
Eli
where
Yenna
is at the moment, and Hostel's two nieces. He also mentions
Johan's mother
, the
Burn Knuckles
and Daniel's friends
Zoe
,
Mira
and
Joy
. Daniel tells the others to not fall for Eugene's bluff, but they are all scared. Eugene says he is willing to not harm the hostages if they hand over Johan. Daniel refuses and says that he will go in Johan's stead. After the meeting, everyone rushes home to find everyone is safe.
Warren
is angry that Eugene was bluffing all along.
Samuel asks Eugene why he didn't just fight them there, and Eugene says he thought of something fun. He asks why
Samuel
was talking to Eli, and Samuel says Eugene should trust him. Eugene then reveals that he was not bluffing about hostages, that his men were just on standby and not in action. Daniel is given a gold badge and an office, along with a kitsune mask. He reveals that he did not join the Workers to help them, but to destroy them from the inside.

Synopsis
Episode 174
As the policeman tries to identify
Daniel
he escapes onto the stairs. Daniel tries to run off with his body but they transferred him elsewhere. Daniel finds his original body in a different room with a new identity: a guy named James Lee. He wonders who his body really is.
The detective tells
Jiho
that everything is okay, he believes Jiho was a victim. He spins a story that Jiho was bullied by
James
and Daniel and they fell as an accident. Jiho runs with this story and is placed in handcuffs because a witness saw that Jiho pushed Daniel. They decide to try him with attempted murder.
Episode 175
The detective tells Jiho he better call a lawyer because he isn't allowed to interrogate minors. Jiho's parents plead that he is innocent but the detective points out fingerprint evidence that Jiho had. He places Jiho in a holding cell. The policeman warns Jiho that if his victims die he will be tried for murder.
Daniel takes the bus to the home address listed on James' file. He wonders if James has a family, and why they didn't contact him. He rings the door and hears someone answer.
Episode 176
Jiho's parents confront Daniel and ask him if he came to the address to settle with James. Daniel asks if they care about the victims and they leave upset. He enters the house to find it empty and unused, but there is a school uniform. Daniel breaks into the school and finds a trophy room full of James' stuff. He also finds a family photograph.
Daniel visits the area in the photograph and begins searching for clues. He comes to an abandoned house with a date for moving house. He finds that James Lee moved to his old house. As he stands outside he hears a voice telling him to enter. That voice is that of
Charles Choi
, Crystal's father.
Episode 177
Charles is angry at Daniel for wasting his talented second body. He tells Daniel that James Lee doesn't exist, and he covered for Daniel to avoid police suspicion. Charles tells Daniel he will reveal his secret to him if he can surpass
DG
, because he fears DG will become to powerful for him to control in the future.
Jiho's lawyer tells Jiho that he can get him out of jail if he plays the victim. Jiho has to lie and state he was bullied by Daniel and James. Jiho fails his case and is sentenced to juvenile prison. As he is brought to the prison yard he notices a sign on the wall saying 'No bad deed goes unpunished'.

[

]
however, there are still numerous flashbacks that occur during arcs in the present. Therefore, this page seeks to help understand the events of the series in chronological order.
0th Generation: The Age of Fists
See article:
0th Generation
The Beginning
Times of chaos in Korea
At least 30 years ago
[
2
]
, Korea had been dominated by the Japanese Yakuza, specifically the
Yamazaki Syndicate
, who oppressed Korea and its inhabitants. As a result, several gangs, which were called "Fists", began to emerge.
Gapryong's Fist vs. Yamazaki Syndicate
Gapryong Kim with some Fist members
At some point,
Gapryong Kim
created
Gapryong's Fist
, bringing together several powerful people, such as
Elite
,
Jinyeong Park
,
Tom Lee
, and
Baekho Kwon
. In this way, Gapryong also began to unite various Fists throughout Korea, until all of Korea was on his side against the Yakuza.
Thus,
Gapryong's Fist was able to fight and win against the Yamazaki Syndicate
[
3
]
.
The Aftermath
After the battle between the two forces,
Shingen Yamazaki
, the president of the Yamazaki Syndicate, fell into a lethargic state. Meanwhile, Korea experienced times of peace and prosperity, and the members of Gapryong's Fist naturally separated, following different paths.
With that, it is possible to describe the following events of that time:
In Korea:
Shinmyung Cheon
established his cult in Cheonliang as the greatest influence in the province.
Gapryong Kim has several children with several women, all of whom are illegitimate children from his marriage to
Minseon Kang
.
Jake Kim
is his last
[
4
]
and only legitimate child.
Mujin Jin
, in possession of the
Red Paper
, seeks to translate it, possibly already suspecting the relationship between Elite and the Yamazaki Syndicate.

, that was abandoned by his family in Cheonliang, is raised by Mujin Jin for a short period of time.

find themselves trapped in a cult of a "dog god", that day, the police intervene and
Johan's mother
is hospitalized.
Gapryong Kim decides to enter politics, with the help of Baekho Kwon.
In Japan
Shintaro's plan
Shintaro Yamazaki
, vice president of the Yamazaki Syndicate, prepares a plan for a new generation of Yamazakis, by preparing 8 women from affiliated families to conceive a child of Shingen.
Gun Park
and 7 other children are born from Shintaro's plan.
Three families affiliated with the Yamazaki Syndicate rebel, unhappy with the management of a lethargic Shingen. All the insurgents and their leaders are executed.
Driven mad after learning the truth about being the firstborn, Shintaro Yamazaki starts a revolution in the Syndicate, killing several people in one night, including his father,
Shinji Yamazaki
. Later that night,
Shingen Yamazaki is killed
.
Gun Park enters Korea illegally, being found on the shores of Busan by Gapryong and Baekho.

“
Charles is about to undertake some major endeavor, and to test my fighting abilities... he sent me two kids in middle school?
”
— Tom Lee to Gun Park and Goo Kim
Tom Lee
is a secondary character in
Lookism.
He also makes an appearance in the
Manager Kim Webtoon.
[1]
Background
A man who fights wildly, known as the "King of the Streets" in Seoul, the "Ultimate (Beggar) King" during the 0th Generation. According to Jinyoung Park, he was a beggar that picked up by Gapryong Kim. After being picked up by Gapryong, he recruited Tom to his Fist Gang and became one of his closest companions alongside Elite and Jinyoung. Around at that time, he also raised Eli Jang and taught him how to fight. Unknowing of his actual name, Eli calls Tom "Mr. Carpenter".
Sometime before or after Gapryong's death, he joined Charles Choi and helped him form the Big Four Crews, becoming one of Charles'
Ten Geniuses
. He also raised two children, Gun and Goo. Sometime after that, he formed the White Tiger Job Centre, an employment agency that will do anything for the right price.
Appearance
Tom is a big middle aged muscular man with a square face, small eyes and long unkempt hair. He is often seen with a very wide smile. He always wears white gloves on his left hand, which hides the truth that he was an amputee due to unknown reason. He prefers fighting only in his boxers to avoid getting his expensive clothes dirty and is usually seen undressing himself right before fighting seriously. 
In the past, he is seen wearing a bum hat and beggar-like clothes.
Personality
Tom is a carefree, playful and easygoing person. He is a man motivated by and for money, evident when Charles Choi paid him to withdraw all his employees from the Workers, but then sent them again because the President of the Workers paid him more. Despite that, however, he seems to remain cautious and not careless about money. This is evident when he hunts down the child he once raised, Eli Jang. He once taught Eli that he should not take money carelessly because the money he received could have other intentions from the person who gave it.
Tom also has a strange interest, sometimes asking to see other people's "birds" or "danglers". He also dislikes being underestimated or being ordered by someone that he sees as being below him, such as Eugene testing him, which he was immediately infuriated by.
Tom also appears to be a caring and understanding person. This is shown when he hunts down Hostel, where he says that families shouldn't be separated and knows they will risk their lives for the sake of the family. Even so, he remains a professional, still doing his job well.
Fighting Prowess
Tom Lee has no direct fighting style, choosing to fight wildly and crudely with his physical capabilities and figure, similarly to Eli Jang and Samuel Seo.
Tom is shown to be very fast for his hulking figure, as he was able to surprise
Johan Seong
with his speed.
[
2
]
His overall durability and endurance are on a whole different level compared to the other characters as he was able to take strikes from the likes of
Warren Chae
[
3
]
and Johan Seong
[
2
]
with ease showing little to no harm done to him. Tom also possesses immense physical strength being able to lift the back of a car with one hand
[
4
]
and hit Johan once and send him flying into a wall
[
2
]
His many years of fighting experience were shown when he tricked Warren into thinking he was going for a headbutt to unpredictably bite one of his eyes instead. He can be quite ruthless in a fight, stomping out
Daniel Park
relentlessly until he was completely knocked out. He fought with the Vice president of Workers,
Mandeok Bang
, who held his own against Tom with the help of
Yuseong
.
Another display of his inhuman strength is when he broke a wall by just flicking his fingers into it.
[2]
It is stated by Manager Kim in his own series that he couldn't think of a way to beat Tom. Also it is considered and assumed that in the entire Pre Generation the only ones above him that could beat him is/was (when they were all in their prime) Gapryong Kim, Elite and Jinyoung Park.
Trivia
Majority of the characters whom have seen Tom at more than 50% of his strength have died.

Contrary to

we have lost everything, everything we cherish

simply spread fear to others
. Or it can be said more simply, the power carried by faith is fading, because there is nothing to protect.

“
Remember this feeling... of dying. Even in the throes of death, be prepared to fight. Let death overtake your body.
”
— Gun Park on Ultra Instinct,
Ep. 439
Ultra Instinct
, also known as
Reverse Eyes
, are the names given to a state where the fighter enters a form of unconsciousness and their bodies' senses and abilities heighten to its maximum possible levels, fighting with their truest and most unbridled selves, hence any extra and unnecessary thoughts, feelings or emotions are completely erased for the time being. Once it's mastered, the fighter is fully conscious and can control their power and maximize their body's capabilities at their own will.
The ability is hereditary in the
Yamazaki Syndicate
, with its heirs being born with black irises and white pupils. It is unknown how
Daniel Park
got this ability.
This form is so absurdly powerful, that Daniel Park was able to outright overwhelm the likes of
Jake Kim
,
Samuel Seo
,
Johan Seong
,
Zack Lee
and even fighters like Gun Park and
Goo Kim
totally, up to a certain time period until it wore off.
Even the Copy Genius,
Johan Seong
, was unable to
copy
Daniel's Ultra Instinct state's perfect movements and fighting style for more than ten seconds, lest the strain of emulating such a vastly superior power broke his own body apart from the sheer strain of maintaining it.
Explanation
Ultra Instinct is only possible in the unconscious of certain individuals, which makes this technique exceedingly rare and inaccessible. To be activated, the user needs to be in a state of falling unconscious, but still determined to be standing, so their body starts to control them, thus eliminating any distractions for the fight, managing to generate acuity, power and finesse extremely overwhelming for even the most powerful of individuals/foes.
In this state, it is common for the user to begin fighting in an apathetic way (thanks to fighting with their unconscious), which often causes the impression that they are a "machine" fighting.
Control Levels
According to the user's experience and understanding of this form, it becomes less difficult to control the Ultra Instinct, with the levels of control categorized as:
Completely Unconscious/ True Ultra Instinct
Do you know why Shingen Yamazaki always fights at full strength alone? It's because he doesn't want to harm his subordinates.
Daniel Park's second body completely unconscious in Ultra Instinct.
At this depth, the user's body has no control or awareness of their actions during Ultra Instinct, so they attack anyone in front of them, regardless of who is an ally or enemy. Like a machine, similar to the terminator. Such becomes it's ultimate purpose, that the body automatically targets the most threatening existence in its immediate locality. And all the skills, talents, gifts, training and experience the user has got, seen others doing, seen others copying and even experienced on their bodies since the beginning is totally unleashed with vastly enhanced clarity and flawless execution.
2nd Body Daniel, when he enters this state, arguably becomes the most powerful living fighter in the verse, ascending to a level of prowess and fighting style which aims to directly oppose, counter and overwhelm any adversary in front of him, with just the equal amount of force and technique. Like a perfect living weapon which repels and neutralizes ANY & ALL assault to itself with unrivalled mimetic adaptation. And it seems that Daniel's Ultra Instinct is fundamentally different from that of how the original Yamazaki Clan members and their genetic branches/offshoots use it as their 'Yamazaki' forms.
This theory is given even more credence by the fact that both Gun and
James Lee
in the past understood that Daniel's Ultra Instinct is fundamentally different in how it performs against an opponent. And also keeping in mind that since Daniel Park has the innate and peerless talent/gift to observe, understand, assimilate and evolve ANY move, fighting style, form, attack or physically possible feat of exertion to even greater heights than the original and make it his own, should be factored into this.
That Daniel's Ultra Instinct form might be the 'evolved' form of what the original state does for Yamazaki blood inheritors. Hence how his Ultra Instinct outclassed and outlasted even Gun's own when they were both fighting at the zenith of their physical and martial ability.
Half-Conscious
Daniel managing to control Ultra Instinct in his original body, thus managing to avoid hitting Bakgu Noh.
A state shown by OG Daniel, where he has just enough control for brief moments, that he can manage to at least pull attacks at the last second, but not enough to exploit all its perks and buffs in the direction he truly wants as his own person.
Complete Consciousness/Mastered Ultra Instinct
Gun Park in Ultra Instinct.
The maximum level of Ultra Instinct control, achieved only by the extremely disciplined and powerful, shown so far only by the members of the Yamazaki Family, namely Shingen, Shintaro, Shinji, and Gun. At this level, the user is able to maintain Ultra Instinct for as long as necessary, and their intellect, consciousness and personality remains completely intact, being able to use Ultra Instinct to its maximum capacity and not be controlled by it, instead exploiting it's perks and advantages to suit their individual desires.
It's been hinted that this might be one of the chief reasons as to why Gun Park is the 'Nurture Genius'; because not only has he proven himself to be a phenomenal teacher by training previously mediocre individuals into undeniably powerful fighting savants, but also that he himself learns and grows perpetually by training others, as stated by his boss, since the Ultra Instinct being always active makes him stronger with every fight and every passing moment, warranting Elite's absolute faith in Gun's services.
Yamazaki's Congenital Ultra Instinct
Gun Park awakens his Yamazaki blood in Episode 513.
Once Gun Park learns about James' intention to kill
Charles Choi
from
Goo Kim
and sees for himself that James is indeed very close to apparently achieving that goal, a nigh-lethal slash Goo dealt him on his neck an instant later makes him unconscious, but due to his absolute loyalty to Elite, he forces his body to still stand and retaliate, fulfilling the most important criteria for unleashing this form.
What followed afterwards is that the body which once talked, walked, moved, fought and thought itself to be ‘Gun Park’ underwent a palpable metamorphosis-of-sorts, causing it now to fight with an uncharacteristic evasion and unhinged ferality integrated in its moveset, completely ignoring the injuries and fatigue previously sustained while significantly amplifying all physical stats ranging from strength, speed, reaction and durability to even more monstrous heights.
All conscience is gone and the usually martial-arts focused fighting style is discarded in favor of outright and instantly brutalizing the enemy with wild, blindingly fast strikes with animalistic instincts and perception, turning into a primal beast who only has its mind set on destroying the one in front of it. Usually Gun is a masochist and prefers taking his opponents attacks head on, but for some reason, Gun's body dodged Goo’s slash in this state, causing even Goo to ask “Who are you?”
It seems to heavily imply, from the statements of both James Lee and Goo, that the form which is so far known and called as ‘Ultra Instinct’, is in reality what the true and unleashed 'Yamazaki' nature is supposed to be.
That this is the original power which later became known as Ultra Instinct. And that it brings out the purest aspects of a fighter's psyche and approach to combat, as in Gun's case it only hinged on fighting to overwhelm and destroy with sheer power while in Daniel's case, it fought with just the appropriate strength, skill and movement, employing an otherworldly efficiency, whilst directly countering the opponent so precisely, that it would accurately match the opponent's power level, no matter how extremely high or how low it is, which seems characteristically appropriate to Daniel's innate personality, as he's someone who doesn't necessarily enjoys a fight for fighting's own sake, and just wants to overcome their opponent with the least possible consequences. It is later revealed that the Congenital Ultra Instinct is far more dangerous as it is used to suppress the strength of Yamazaki's violent nature. which can tear apart the opponents on being unleashed it even rivaled Gapryong Kim's strength.

Synopsis
Episode 81
It is the weekend, and
Daniel
is heading to
Vasco's
birthday party with
Enu
. Due to his drinking problem, Daniel assures himself that Vasco will hold the party at a normal cafe or restaurant. He reveals that both bodies were invited, but he wanted to go as his original.
Crystal
is also jogging in her original body, saying that it has become a habit to run. However, she meets Enu, who bites her, and realizes that Daniel is also close by. They make small talk, and both of them lament being in their original bodies; Daniel thinking that he cannot talk to her because if his new body had no chance, his original does not have any either, and Crystal thinking that she cannot talk to him because all guys like pretty girls. They both head to the Han River, thinking that they "don't want to split."
Vasco turns out to be partying in the park, in the wintertime, on a blanket. He is incredibly happy that Daniel made it, and the latter excuses his new body by saying that he is sick. Vasco asks if Crystal is Daniel's girlfriend, which he denies. Three
Burn Knuckles
are there, as well as
Zack
and
Mira
and
Taejoon
. They are all freezing, and Daniel tries to ask Vasco to go indoors, but Vasco is so happy that no one has the heart to say it.
The Burn Knuckles apparently had a party at a pork restaurant, and they had drawn lots to see who would go to the park party, because "we didn't all need to die,"
Jace
explains to Daniel. Zack tries to leave the fool's party, but Mira convinces him to stay. They sing Happy Birthday to Vasco, and everyone is relieved when the candles are blown out, as surely Vasco would move inside now; but Vasco pretends not to notice and blows anyway.
Daniel gives Vasco pictures of Enu's pups, since he knows about Vasco's love of dogs. Vasco is touched. Jace, who searched for months, presents Vasco with a Special Edition Heroman figurine. Vasco is moved. Zack grabs a rock and writes "GOOD LUCK" on it, insisting that it was a treasure from his mother and it will grant good luck to its owner. Vasco is again moved, as the others note that Zack isn't even bothering to hide the magic marker. Taejoon creates a Pacebook account for Vasco and gathers 100,000 followers, which Vasco responds to with apathy.
Vasco wants to play a recreational mating game, in which "three" consists of the third Burn Knuckle, Jace, and Daniel, the last two wondering what would happen to Vasco and Crystal. Jace tries again to move the party indoors but fails. Vasco calls "two" and reaches for Mira, but Zack, in a burst of fury, clips his nose. Vasco, blood streaming from his face, insists that it was an accident, and they move on.
Daniel is chosen to play Duck, Duck, Goose. The three Burn Knuckles try again to talk to Vasco, but when he thanks Jace for always being his friend, Jace is too moved to speak. Zack tries to leave again, but it stopped by Mira. Then, Zack thinks about making Vasco mad. He takes out the Heroman figurine, replaces it with his rock, and throws the present into the river, saying that "Heroman went for a swim in the water." Vasco jumps in after the present.
Episode 82
Vasco yells that he will not come out of the river until he finds Jace's present. Jace calls out to him, but Zack stops him, saying that if there is a fight to come, Vasco should use up his strength before it.
Police have arrived ono the scene, and Vasco has knocked out the entire Rescue Team. The Police ask if there is a tranquilizer gun for catching bears, to which the answer is negative. Zack realizes that Vasco's stamina is limitless. A reporter hears Vasco repeating the words "gift" and "precious" and deduces that he has been heartbroken by a lover. At last, Zack jumps into the river with the figurine that he took out earlier and calls to Vasco.
Vasco and Zack get out and have some warm drinks, but Vasco realizes that Zack's rock and the Heroman box are still missing. Vasco again jumps into the river, intent on finding the rock. All the guys jump into the water as Mira and Crystal wonder if they should call the authorities again. Daniel starts drowning and is saved by Enu. While Crystal is desperately trying to make Daniel wake up,
Eli
appears on the scene and creates another Good Luck rock. He hands it to Zack, who waves it at Vasco again. Everyone starts getting out of the river when Vasco notices something.
Zack ceremoniously turns to present the rock to Vasco again when he sees Vasco holding both the box and the rock. Vasco demands to know who was at the root of the problem, and everyone points to Zack. The party ends with Zack's K.O.
Jay
is seen watching the 9 o'clock news as he sees Crystal kneeling over Daniel on television.
Zoe
also sees this and wonders sadly why Daniel is with another girl. Crystal, now in her new body, snaps a picture of this scene of the TV and happily saves it as her background picture on her phone.

Synopsis
Episode 178
Jace
finds a worried
Vasco
in a cherry tree field and asks what the problem is. He is mortified to find out Vasco is going on a blind date. He consults the
Burn Knuckles
but quickly realizes they have no experience with women. He asks
Zack Lee
, and he teaches Vasco how to corner a girl into a wall like a romantic. He ignores this advice but Vasco is awed.
Jace finds
Leonn
surrounded by girls and she asks him if he is going to the fireworks event that night. He tells her about Vasco's date and asks for advice. Vasco tells Leonn he wants to get married someday. Leonn is offended and kicks Vasco, telling him to change his fashion sense. Later, she is seen working out to release her anger towards Vasco. She calls him an idiot for not realizing that he had asked a girl for love advice.
Jace begs
Jay
to help Vasco prepare to the date since he is good at fashion. When Jace and Leonn spy on Vasco's date they are shocked to see she is very pretty. When they see Vasco finally appear they do not recognize him because he looks a lot better than he did before.
Episode 179
Jay worked very hard to change Vasco's appearance, giving him nice clothing and fixing his hair. As Vasco approaches the girl he does Zack's wall trick, but there is no wall, which confuses the girl. He takes her to a fish store which serves disgusting food, but she tries to be polite to him. As Vasco remembers Jace's advice, he holds the girl's hair up as she is eating food. Leonn laughs at Vasco's idiocy and Jace is horrified.
The girl runs off in tears and almost trips when Vasco catches her. He tells her he is sorry for being a terrible date, and that he is only inexperienced. The girl falls for his kindness and decides to give him another chance. Jace is happy to hear it but Leonn is not. She kicks him and walks away, and Jace suspects she has a crush on Vasco.
Near the Han river Leonn skips stones, upset that Vasco's date is going so well. Vasco appears with the fireworks and asks if he is late to the event. Leonn is surprised that he remembered, and Vasco tells her he left his date because the Burn Knuckles are more important to him than love. She chases him with the firecracker and laughs at his stupidity.
Cookie 1
Vasco explains to the girl that he cannot date her because he wants to raise a kangaroo. He leaves her to go to the Burn Knuckles, and Jace is confused.
Cookie 2
The girl visits J high to find Vasco. She is shocked to see his actual appearance and doesn't believe it. When she runs into Leonn she mistakes her for a boy and falls for her, but is rejected immediately.
Cookie 3
The Burn Knuckles are celebrating Vasco's success by setting up a venue on how to date girls. Onlookers warn girls to stay away from the Burn Knuckles.

's frequent sexual assault for her son's sake.
Relationships
TBA
Synopsis
She and Vin Jin came to Cheonliang when Vin was young, where she witnessed the horrors of the area's king, the Shaman, had on the people. She attempted to escape several times, but had her attempts blocked as everyone she interacted with was a follower of the shaman.
When Vin was nine, the girl she had doted on confessed she had witnessed one of the Shaman's assaults, who tried to reassure her by excusing it as a Judo. The next time she was called by the Shaman, she asked for him to stop, only for Shinmyung to intimidate her by saying it would only get worse for her son. This caused her to break into tears, asking what she did wrong, sending the Shaman into a rage as he begin to beat her. He would then tell her why he had been so horrible to her, the actual details unknown but seeming to involve a dark skinned woman who could possibly be
Taejin Cheon
's mother, and her own husband, Mujin Jin. The Shaman then strangled her, before her body would be hung by a noose in her and Vin Jin's reisdence, framing her death as a suicide.

Overview

Vin Jin
(진호빈 Jin Ho-Bin) is a student of the Vocal and Dance department of
J High School
. He joined
Allied
in order to find
Cheon Taejin
and kill him.
Appearance
Vin Jin is a tall, muscular man. His crew cut hairstyle, which was later changed to shaggy bangs
[
2
]
, is often obscured by a cap. He has polycoria (multiple pupils) in his left eye, with two gray irises (and pupils) joined horizontally; Vin Jin hides it with heavily tinted sunglasses which makes vision nigh-impossible. During a few of his fights, he has been seen wearing tinted goggles. In the later chapters, He wears a white jacket which reads “tiān liǎng” (天倆) In Chinese characters that read as “Heavenly Skilled” on the right side.
His clothing has always consisted of wearing designer brands, as well as commonly wearing chains.
[1]
Personality
Vin Jin has quite an arrogant and selfish personality, believing he is the most handsome student at J High. He wishes to be superior among everyone, feeling jealous when someone else is better than him. This leads to bullying being his resolve, stepping on others so he can remain at the top. His carelessness makes him get into fights that he has a major disadvantage in.
Whenever it comes to his eyes, he is very secretive. He covers them with tinted sunglasses, making him considerably handicapped when it comes to his sight. It was once stated that he tinted one pair of his sunglasses six times and was virtually unable to see.
[
3
]
However,  Vin Jin is quite insecure about his eyes and attempts to hide them even without his sunglasses, panicking when faced with the prospect of having them taken off. It is revealed in Chapter 381 that  Vin Jin's insecurities stemmed from his polycoria, going as far as attempting to gouge it out as a child due to being stigmatized for it.
When it comes to his friendship with Mary Kim, he is shown to cover his considerate feelings with his playful comments and makes objectionable ideas. Deep down, he cares greatly for her,
[
4
]
going as far as to beat up Hostel members for using photos of her in their business.
Fighting Prowess
Vin Jin specializes in Judo,
[
3
]
[
5
]
a martial art of unarmed combat that derives from Jujitsu. It mainly consists of unbalancing or flipping the opponent using one's leverage abilities. Later, it is discovered that he also specializes in Kudo,
[
6
]
a martial art that originates from Japan where one uses punches, kicks, and submission techniques to overwhelm their opponent. In addition to this, he is well informed of dirty fighting and Korean wrestling.
[
7
]
At the beginning of the comic, he is largely known for acting better than others, causing fights he has no mercy in. Later on, revealing that his sunglasses handicap  Vin Jin to the point he is almost blind. It is found that he is an extremely proficient fighter and martial artist. Without wearing his handicap, his speed, strength, and techniques are exponentially enhanced, as demonstrated when he easily took out Ivan Park.
[
3
]
He has stated that he could beat those who are on the same fighting level as Daniel, Logan, and Zack Lee when he was in middle school.  This had been the definite case before most of the
2nd generation
main
characters
reached mastery. Furthermore, Eugene implied Vin's strength is greater than anyone else's who is capable of being in the circus through his letter grading and possibly comparable to the likes of
Ryuhei
, or at the very least at the level of
kings
.
By the time the cast began fighting against the Workers Second Affiliate, Vin Jin was able to destroy trees barehandedly and pose a serious threat in the underground fighting ring.
When  Vin Jin joined Allied to combat the workers with his own goal being revenge on Taejin Cheon for his crimes upon Sujin, the two from Cheonliang were given the opportunity to fight to the death. It was also stated, in the battle, that Vin had gotten stronger than his middle school prime. However, at the climax of their fight, Taejin revealed just how much of an astronomical gap there was between the two. This is still relevant to  Vin Jin because he had reached a point of being at the higher level of kings while being considered one when  Vin and Taejin in the past weren't far off from each other in level. The consideration in itself is due to him being likely responsible of overtaking Cheonliang by first murdering the Cheonliang king.
The final piece of information about  Vin's power is the relevancy of Cheonliang throughout all of the generations as it is the breeding ground of monsters. The other known example, besides the two from the 2nd generation and the Cheonliang king from the 1st generation, is Jinyoung Park.  Vin's narrative in the next arc of Cheonliang starts with his flashback/backstory, which will be about the 1st generation and himself 10 years ago.
Fights
He was shown to do basic slaps, punches, and kicks, additionally grabbing opponents by the hair or collar.
[
8
]
He had attempted a leg sweep on
Vasco
but failed to cause damage, getting handled by Vasco's one-handed flip.
[
5
]
When in conflict with
Logan
, he grabs him by the collar, saying "rubber rubber arms," (most likely referencing Luffy from One Piece). Then, he grabs Logan by the collar and forearm of his shirt, attempting to flip, but gets beaten in return.
During  Vin Jin's fight with
Ivan
, after the removal of  Vin's sunglasses, he can increasingly rely on Ivan. After Ivan's counter-attempt to  Vin's Judo flip,  Vin tackles Ivan by the neck. He successfully evades Ivan's grapple endeavors with speed, attempting to pull him down by the arm, and is captured in Ivan's arms. He breaks out with his strength and lifts his arms.  Vin Jin then counteracts with a forbidden Judo move called Kani Basami, similar to Wrestling's 'Scissor Takedown,' in which he interlocks his legs around his opponent's waist and can either lay them on their back or break their knees.
During his fight with Akira during Worker's Second Affiliate Arc in the fighting ring, he showed monstrous reaction speed avoiding Akira's attacks and then he dislocated his arms rendering him unable to fight. While fighting Sato Kazuma in the lobby he was beaten one-sidedly but didn't flinch. Once he fought back, he pulverized Sato by lifting and slamming him on the ground thus ending the fight quickly.
In the recent chapter while fighting
Changyong Ji
he was unfazed by this headbutt and his attacks he picked
Ji
with one hand and slammed him on the ground repeatedly. When Ji tried to remove his grip Vin didn't even budge thus it proved his monstrous grip strength.
It was later revealed that he was the disciple of the First Generation King of Cheonliang
Seongji Yook
, who taught him how to fight. Seongji said that  Vin Jin had a lot of potential and he just triggered it by training him, It is also revealed that he was the son of
Jin Mujin
the legend of Korean wrestling and ssireum, a fighter said to be on par with
Gapryong Kim
. Yook also taught him his father's fighting style called the
Mujin Ssireum
, where one can break the opponents' bones with their monstrous grip strength.
In Busan arc he fought with the crew succesors event breaking their body parts criplling them with his grip strength he slo fought Jangyeon Na with ALLIED overpowering him making other hallucinating him as Seonji Yuk.

Quotes
Trivia
Vin Jin has an extremely rare eye condition called polycoria, where one has multiple pupils in one eye.
[
9
]
Despite outwardly hating Duke, he is a large fan of his rapping, which he vehemently denies.
[
10
]
One of  Vin Jin's sunglasses is tinted 6 times more than normal.
[
10
]
Vin Jin hates handsome guys, due to him feeling insecure and jealous since he was often bullied for his eye condition, which others called a curse.

Synopsis
History
He has been said to have many enemies from his past.
[

]
He even murdered someone at one point.
He seems to have a bad relationship to a gang known as the 'Cheonliang Fam.' While Vin Jin was in this gang, as the boss, they would choose their boss by fighting while the ground was covered in shards of glass.
[
2
]
When he was in elementary school, his mother took him to Cheongliang so a shaman could fix Vin Jin's polycoria. This was soon revealed to be a religious scam as a 'sacrifice' was offered in order to transfer Vin's 'curse', his polycoria. His mother would try to take Vin Jin with her to escape Cheongliang, but such a thing proved impossible as every authority figure was part of the shaman's cult. As the two were kept under constant surveillance, Vin's mother eventually committed suicide, leaving Vin to become the new sacrifice at the age of eight, as the old one had run away.
He would be relentlessly bullied for his condition until he even attempted to gouge out his own eye, before standing up for himself and beating the children who had bullied him. As he graduated elementary and entered middle school, he became infamous for his eye and his strength, but wasn't strong enough to escape his position as a sacrifice.
As he fulfilled this position for the first time in years, the other kids from his school were there to witness the ceremony, causing Vin to finally run away out of shame and a desire to die to escape his life. The method he chose to die was to enter the cave of Cheongliang Mountain, where a horned monster was said to dwell that ate humans.
It was there he met his teacher, the King of Cheongliang,

episode TBA
Vivi
is a minor character in
Lookism
. She was the President of Workers' 3rd Affiliate, and her main language is Chinese.
Appearance
She has light brown hair. When she gets high, her eyes turn into an empty color,
Personality
Vivi is quite heartless as it is seen that she only views humans as objects. She's quite naïve and doesn't fully comprehend her actions, so she has a very twisted personality.
Relationships
Xiaolong
Xiaolung is her body guard but he also has a "God" complex with her. He almost worships her and will do absolutely anything to protect her. He has stated before that she is an "Angel" for him. Vivi's Father forced him as a child to be her protector and since he had no one and really just was an orphan, he really didn't have a choice in the matter.
[

]
Synopsis
History
When Vivi was young she met Xiaolung and gave him his name, this makes Xiaolung fall in love with her. Once she's older, she gets attacked, by the people who are meant to protect her because of her ignorant, rude behaviour towards them. But then Xiaolung comes and saves her, this is probably the moment she started to develop feelings for him. He then becomes her bodyguard because of the incident. Once she's in high school she confesses her feelings for Xiaolung but he rejects her because he has sworn to be her bodyguard and nothing else, even though he does return those feeling, although he does not explain that to her.
She goes to Korea so that she can less conspicuously do drugs, due to the fact that she's an addict, because in China you can get executed for doing drugs, and since she is a multi-billionaire's daughter it can also cause  large media commotion. Another reason she goes to Korea is to become a part of the third affiliate, along with her several bodyguards, who have sworn to protect her.
Once Xiaolung gets severely hurt she shows a clear compassion for her love for him by running over to him and comforting him in her arms. After that they move back to China and start living in an unknown forest of bamboos in a little hut, dedicating that she will do everything that he did for her, due to the fact that he can no longer walk, and that she will stop doing drugs. After that he requests her to get him a blanket so she runs to the hut to get one but when she returns he's not there because her father did not approve of the relationship. But only told her that he was dead so she wouldn't persist. Xiaolung knew this and accepted the fact that their love could never work and left, with his master. Vivi is left heartbroken.
Episode 320
She gets high on LSD, but a cleanup crew covers her tracks and cleans up the hotel room she is staying in. Later, she goes outside to eat fishsticks from Vasco's stand, and Vasco wonders if she's drunk because her eyes are so empty. She falls and is about to get caught by Jake, but her bodyguard appears out of nowhere and picks her up, speaking to her in Chinese. After she leaves, Vasco realizes that she didn't pay.

Crystal
calls one of the main streamers from Kwitch to ask if she has figured out anything suspicious while she was there. That girl is revealed to be
Yui
in a costume. Crystal decides to investigate ONE MCN further, worried that her father bought the company for nefarious reasons.
Johan
and
Zack
begin fighting as Zack swears to bring him home. Johan is surprised to see how strong Zack became, but he is still stronger than him. He missed on one shot, and Zack realizes that Johan is going blind. When Zack asks why
his mother
isn't enough of a reason to return, Johan tells Zack that revenge is all he has left. His mother will be heartbroken if she realizes that he is going blind as well. Zack swears to help Johan defeat
Gun
and the
four crews.
Johan goes to the White Tiger agency for an interview.

Johan
later goes to White Tiger Job Center to ask about

The Burn Knuckles
and
Vin Jin
are also training to become more powerful, and
Logan Lee
drops out of school. He is then seen leaving the school with Goo, heading towards Workers’ third affiliate.

Wally Lee (이도규 Lee Do Kyu)
is a minor character in
Lookism
.
Appearance
Wally is short and skinny, normally walking with his back hunched. He has long, straight black hair and whited-out eyes.
Personality
During the series he has shown unstable behaviour showing little care about people around, the only time he shown care was towards his so called lover Juliet a plant in the room and
Jiho
who watered Juliet. But this can change very quickly as when Wally sees that Jiho didn't water Juliet he tries to kill him. It could be possible that his behaviour is most likely due to drug usage as in Juvenile his name tag was blue.
Relationships
Backdoor
Jiho Park
Earlier, he is shown to have protected Jiho from Darius Hong and his other cellmates, but it is revealed that he was not actually protecting Jiho but only his plant Juliet. He attacks Jiho and almost kills him when he sees his plant dying due to lack of water.
After Jiho is released from solitary confinement, he takes over all the cellmates including Wally using fear, making them do his dirty work and taking the blame for him. Wally attacked
Jason Yoon
on Jiho's orders after Jason challenged Jiho.
Darius Hong
TBA
Synopsis
Fighting Prowess
Even though Wally doesn't know any martial arts he uses everything at hands as shown when he sharpened his toothbrush to use as a weapon. He stabbed
Darius
with it, he also used his forehead and bit Darius's foot.

“
I don't think I can pull it off this time. But then again... Who else can do it, if not me?
”
Warren Chae (채원석 Chae Won Seok)
is a supporting character in Lookism. He is one of the few members left in Hostel B and
Sally Park
's love interest.
Appearance
Warren is tall young man, roughly the same height as
Eli
.
Warren possesses pale skin, black gelled hair, and a developed musculature. He has a rough appearance overall, and mainly wears black and white. In his middle school years he had short hair cut close to his head.
Currently, Warren after joining the Workers, wears a formal suit with a golden badge with the symbol of the crew, in addition to now having a kind of formal topknot.
Personality
During his middle school years, Warren was shown to be very prideful, taking offense to anyone who insulted him or Max and Derrick. Warren has a strong moral compass and does not like stealing or being dishonest. He is considerate for those he has formed bonds with, keeping dedication to them by risking his life to protect his family. Even in minor situations, he will take great lengths to avoid stirring them any sort of trouble.
He has taken a huge crush towards
Sally
. Before realizing Sally had feelings for
Eli
, Warren would make unnecessary comments implying him and Sally doing couple things together. Afterwards, he now stays heedful and respectful that Sally does not reciprocate her feelings. He still continues to be protective of her, covering her eyes so she doesn't have to watch hurtful things, and going as far as fighting to defend her.
He enjoys calling himself, "Gangdong's Mighty Warren Chae," and has the habit of keeping a fight record. He naturally speaks in a matter with words omitted from his speech in inconvenient places, which has become an ongoing joke for characters to comment on, however he seems to have fixed this habit as of late.
History
Warren was placed into an orphanage after his father beat his mother to death, and is implied his father was taken to prison. It is noted that he came to the orphanage when he was 10, and has been watching over Max and Derek for 5 years (As of the
Eli Jang Arc
. He hated to be looked down and made fun of, and would recoil by getting into fights with the students.
Warren always had a crush on Sally Park, and was jealous of Eli Jang. He offered to stay in Sally's home to protect her from Eli, who he thought was dangerous. After some time, he grew closer to Eli and joined him in creating Hostel. When Eli left Hostel, Warren stayed behind for Sally Park, waiting for Eli to return.
Fighting Prowess
Warren is an experienced and accomplished fighter given his ability to have thousands of wins with only 4 defeats (those defeats coming from the other members of the original Hostel). Warren has shown to be powerful enough in his younger years to defeat the entire Back Door crew with help from Max and Derek and was even be praised by Gun.
When he first met Vasco, he was impressed by his incredible strength considering they were on are relatively equal level.
Jerry Kwon
also has high respect for Warren Chae because of his endurance and lack of skill. Early in his life, Warren possessed little in the way of a set style though understood the fundamentals of fighting making him a brawler. Despite this, Warren possesses a sense of honour and pride concerning fighting with opponents that fight unfairly such as Eli being a strong counter towards Warren. As a direct result of his continual exposure to street fights with no professional training, Warren Chae unintentionally adopted the fighting philosophy of Jeet Kune Do (JKD) (though many, including the author himself, refer to JKD as a style in addition to a philosophy). Warren Chae and JKD's philosophy mirror each other in that they espouse attacking the weakest areas of the human body with as much force as possible.
However, after his encounter with
Senior Manager Kim
(SMK) (whom stated Warren Chae mirrored himself to a near uncanny degree when he was younger), SMK decided to offer Warren his expertise in JKD. As such, Warren now possesses not only his immense physical strength, speed, and fortitude on par with Jerry Kwon, but technical foundations in martial arts as a result of formal tuition.
As a result of his development, Warren Chae has stated that he would win a rematch with Jerry or Eli.
As of Episode 380 we learn that Warren's fighting skills have been corrected by SMK and he now has a foundation of CQC as well as his JKD proficiency
It is stated by Sinu Han that along with Eli Jang that Warren Chae has achieved Mastery. Even though both Eli and Warren have gotten a lot stronger and even took out a 1st gen king together they still are not on the same level as Sinu Han, as in their fight the only damage Sinu took was from a cheap shot from Mandeok Bang while Warren and Eli were both bloodied up and damaged, but Sinu was surprised by their endurance as they didn't fall yet even with the damage they took.
In the current arc It's shown that Warren developed his own
"New CQC Style"
. While fighting
Jerry Kwon
who almost defeated Warren,Its shown that Warren decided to bring out his own CQC style. It is shown in the flashback that while training again with Manager Kim, Warren was able to  make him kneel on his feet by using his
New CQC
(
which he developed by mixing his self taught JKD with the CQC
). He used it deflect Jerry's full force punch and land a series of attacks on him to thus defeating him. The only drawback of this style is that  it leaves him unable to fight anymore after using it as the style pushes Warren's body to it's utmost limit just like he was unable to move properly at the end of his fight with Jerry.
Even
Senior Manager Kim(SKM)
told that due to the not having a particular pattern this style would be difficult to be copied by the "Genius" (reffering to
Johan Seong
as  he was able to copy the old CQC shown by
SKM)
.
Quotes
"Nice to meet you, let me introduce myself. 1083 matches, 1079 wins, and 4 defeats. I'm Gangdong's Might Warren Chae."
[

]
"Mister, we're no thugs like you. You know what Eli, I think he just looked down on us. We're Hostel. What are you gonna do now, mister?"
[

]
"A man never regrets anything. You're coming back like this, Eli Jang."
[
5
]
"...Alright, so you're rich. ...I guess you can afford dentures."
[4]
"Whew... I almost let my emotions take over my punches."
[5]
[1]
Trivia
Warren's unintentional adoption of Jeet Kune Do as his martial art mirrors JKD's founder, Bruce Lee. With most historians and experts agreeing that Lee begun the development of his style as a result of mainly street fights and his tutelage under Wing Chun (which itself is a martial art mainly known for its street fighting applications).
Warren has the ability to walk silently as a result of SMK's training.
Warren's speech impediment has been implied to be as a result of brain damage due to it being compounded after his fight with Eli Jang wherein he faced great difficulty and eventually lost.
His 4 defeats were against Derek and Max, Eli Jang, Jerry Kwon, and Gun Park.

The
White Tiger Job Centre (Baekho HRM)
[
1
]
is a mercenary organization founded by
Tom Lee
. Candidates that exhibit remarkable fighting skills are selected and trained by Lee. Companies and billionaires highly value and seek for these bodyguards. They are currently associated with the Workers. All of them (except for interns) appeared in
Manager Kim Webtoon.
The White Tiger Job centre also appears in Laws of a good child, another manhwa set in the Lookism universe.
History
Organization
The White Tiger are mercenaries for hire, willing to do anything for the right price. These activities can range from simple bodyguard duties to kidnapping, and even more. Their niche is locating people and places, no matter how hidden they may seem.
The White Tiger consists of "Departments", with the most capable members being appointed "Department Head", or "Manager", while others are "employees". Tom Lee sits on top of the ranks as "major-general".
Members
In Manager Kim, Kim Hyoseung is revealed to have become the White Tigers Subcontractor.

Workers
is a part of the
Four Major Crews
. Their base is south of the Han River. Their leader is
Eugene
.
History
TBA
Organization
They are known to be the crew that strictly earns their cash through legal methods and are said to be very business-like. Jace mentions that Workers are more of an enterprise than a crew when explaining the concepts of the 4 Big Crews to Daniel. Their method for maintaining that they aren't a crew is by earning money through legal matters and official businesses, also dressing in strict business attire.
Unlike God Dog and Big Deal, and like Hostel, Workers is split into several factions that are all recognized as part of the crew, but are separate factions that operate independently but are aware of each other and use similar means of recognizing status. For Workers, these are small badges with colors and patterns:
Black:
VVIPs - Individuals to be treated with the utmost importance, there are only five of them in total. The five VVIPs are
Gun Park
,
Goo Kim
,
Charles Choi
,
Jinyeong Park
, and
Yuseong
.
White Gold:
Presidents of each affiliate - only five exist.
Gold + Symbol:
Senior members of Workers (Executives), Combat Experts, and Directors - important figures in maintaining their factions.
Gold:
Hired mercenaries or new members of Workers - Paid by the Factions, but do not necessarily know that the company belongs to Workers.
None:
Normal workers in the factions and does not recognize the company as part of Workers, but do understand the badge statuses.
The Workers currently consists of four major affiliates that operate through illegal means, but cover up with a legal façade to hide traces. The Workers acquired
K House
and
White Tiger Job Centre
through recent purchases. There was also a fifth affiliate added later on.
First Affiliate: The Grimm Plastic Surgery Center
The Grimm Plastic Surgery Tower
The First Affiliate of
Workers
is a plastic surgery hospital located at the heart of Seoul, with its legal business being that of a plastic surgery clinic directly managed and owned by the affiliate's president
Hangyeoul Baek
.
Their illegal business has two forms: Regular patients, and VIPs. The handling of regular patients involves the dispatch of the clinic's private ambulances, allowing them to show up to emergencies and extort high fees from the loved ones of the patient. The handling of VIPS has them hunt powerful and/or wealthy people so that they can use section 24 of the Mental Health Act, where they can commit a person to a mental hospital, even without the consent of the concerned party as long as consent has been obtained from two people responsible for the person and a mental health professional. When admitting the person, their belongings/properties are distributed to those responsible, effectively usurping their effects and influence. Even though it is outside the law, the psychiatric hospital admits these people and abuses them, acting outside of human rights, and not even allowing the supposed patient to call an attorney.
Second Affiliate: Lucky Casino
Lucky Cassino
The second affiliate's legal business consists of a casino, while the illegal business is called "Circus", where they kidnapped the world's dangerous criminals, and left them to fight and die for the entertainment of the casino's VIPs, after the entry of
Doo Lee
, the Circus was reformulated, starting to be separated into four games, namely:
Ant Shaking: The game is comprised of a game of rock, paper, scissors against the executive
Hyottoko
, if the player loses,
Hyottoko
slaps him with all his strength, if the player wins, he moves on to the next game, if he survives
Hyottoko's
slap, he also advances to the next game. This phase has a secret:
Hyottoko's
pose at the beginning of the game is a direct hint of his chosen move, allowing the player to predict his choice.
Gas Hell: After the first game, the arena is suddenly flooded with (what appears to be) tear gas.
Quest-ism: The game consists of VIPs sending missions to players, if the player completes his mission, in addition to receiving a reward in Won, he moves on to the next round.
Catch-the-God: Players must fight and defeat/kill Executive
Shiba
(after Sinu Han's departure, it remains a mystery as to how the most recent fourth game turned out).
Its CEO is
Mitsuki Soma
, known as Neko but she is temporarily removed from the position due to emotional incapacity, with the branch currently being run by the executive
Ryuhei Kuroda
.
Third Affiliate: Club ViVi
Entrance of Vivi Club
Club ViVi is a nightclub owned by
Vivi
, their former president. Their legal business consisted of running the nightclub, whereas their illegal business was creating and distributing drugs across Korea, one significant example being the Pungsan cult.
At some point, the 3rd Affiliate was the branch that hosted Circus, where players fought naked, presumably to death.
The third affiliate's current president is unknown as
Samuel Seo

Fourth Affiliate: ONE MCN
Access card for ONE MCN
ONE MCN is a company that employs streamers to make money. The streamers come from many platforms such as PaprikaTV, Kwitch, and others. Many of these streamers work with legal contracts, but ONE MCN also employs minors to work in their illegal streaming business using fraudulent contracts. These minors are locked in rooms of tempered glass in ONE MCN's basement floor. They are forced to work without pay and are not allowed to leave the facility. Streamers are monitored using cameras and are kept in line via threats from hired mercenaries of the
White Tiger Job Centre
.
ONE MCN was purchased by Alexander Hwang after he made a fortune from Bitcoin following middle school. Hwang was later replaced by Samuel Seo, his former director. Following the downfall of the fourth affiliate at the hands of
Tom Lee
, Charles Choi bought the company and its building and became the official owner of the fourth affiliate.
The fourth affiliate's current president is unknown as
Samuel Seo
, the one who inherited the affiliate from
Hwang
, was stripped of his position by Eugene.
Fifth Affiliate: Loaning Business
The Fifth Affiliate is a loaning business devised by
Eli Jang
after he was forced to join Workers along with
Warren
. Its duties consist of going outside Seoul and forcing people to take loans before they are forced to have to pay a ridiculous sum of money in order to repay the loan.
The fifth affiliate's current president is unknown as Eli Jang, the affiliate's founder and president, has since abandoned his position to return to Hostel with Warren.

Synopsis
Workers (4th Affiliate)
Daniel Park
joined ONE MCN after receiving a card from Gun. He signed a contract along with
Natalie Cho
and
Amy Lee
to stream for ONE MCN, but the three of them were held hostage and forced to become part of ONE MCN's illegal streaming business. Daniel, Warren and Doo Lee infiltrated ONE MCN as VVIPs to expose their business and save the kidnapped streamers. They managed to find the streamers but were only able to save Amy and Natalie: the other streamers were taken away by the White Tiger agency to the Workers third affiliate, including the president. Daniel lost all evidence of their crimes except for a spy cam he used on his coffee cup during his disguise.
Samuel Seo abandoned ONE MCN afterwards, leaving the company without a leader. However, he still maintained his status as the head of the fourth affiliate. Charles Choi eventually bought ONE MCN from the Workers and became its owner.
Workers (3rd Affiliate)
Club Vivi was infiltrated by Daniel, in order to confirm the dealings inside. Both his bodies were used in order to infiltrate it.
The club was managed by
Vivi
, a Chinese lady who hid in Korea to escape her traditional family, and partly to escape her drug charges in China. She was with
Xiaolong
, her loyal bodyguard.
The Club Vivi closed out in the aftermath of the incident, Vivi forces to return to China and do the arranged marriage her father organised, which Xiaolung intervened. The control came at the hands of Samuel.
Workers (2nd Affiliate)
Sinu Han
disappeared after taking the deal. Daniel had to join forces with
Jake Kim
and
Big Deal
to infiltrate the club run by
Mitsuki Soma
, that has casinos as a front, but actually an underground gladiator coliseum underground.
With the help of pre-
Allied
crew and Jake, they infiltrated the coliseum, joining the death game themselves. In the midst of it, chaos happened. Eventually, they rescued Sinu Han and returned to the Shopping Street.
The affiliate came under
Eugene
's direct control, and gave the control to
Ryuhei Kuroda
.
Workers (1st Affiliate)
Daniel Park
had to form the
Allied
crew to infiltrate the 1st affiliate, in order to talk to
Jinyeong Park
, and find clues where his other body was hidden, at the behest of one of the Pre Generation's clues. He had also called on to
Jerry Kwon
and
Jake Kim
to assist him in infiltrating, with
Jay Hong
's assistance of acquiring an ambulance and
Jibeom Kwak
driving it, and also he wants to rescue
Jihan Kwak
.
The 1st Affiliate was formerly an underground battle royale called "Hell", where the worst of the worst criminals in Korea had to fight to survive. Eugene labelled this the place where "only the strong will survive". The reigining champion was
Cheon Taejin
.
Afterwards, the 1st Affiliate was converted into a mental asylum, where Private First-Aid responders, led by Cheon Taejin would lock up said "mentally unstable" individuals for an indefinite amount of time unless specified, as per request by individuals. VIP's here, are imprisoned by their own request and taken care of like royalty.
The Affiliate was originally run by Eugene himself, and later handed to
Gyeol Baek
, assuming
Hangyeol Baek
's identity.
After the destruction of the affiliate, Daniel Park entered a truce with Eugene to take down Charles Choi.
Crew Strength
TBA
Fighting Capabilities
Due to their large numbers, the Workers have a large amount of competent fighters, some able to contend with the likes of the crew heads, some able to overpower them momentarily.
Allies and Subordinates
Allied
After Daniel Park's revelation and the destruction of the First Affiliate, he offered a truce with Eugene in exchange for 2 things:
A meeting with Chairman Steve Hong
The residence of Gun Park
Weakness
The Workers possess Jinyoung Park and James Lee, two figures of utmost significance to Charles Choi, an extremely powerful figure, formerly Eugene's boss and a follower of the legend of the 0th Generation gapryong kim and he has close ties with the Yamazaki Syndicate in Japan and runs the HNH Group. This would result in the Workers being under constant threat of destruction as Charles works towards finding Jinyoung and capturing Eugene.

Synopsis
Episode 372
A month after
Jiho Park's death
,
Daniel Park
continues to work for the
Workers
,
Zack Lee
approaches him to let him know that people are worried about whatever he is up to with the Workers. At the end of class, Daniel goes with
Eugene
to a limousine.
Daniel asks Eugene when he will go to the 2nd affiliate, Eugene soon replies that he will visit the affiliate now, Eugene asks Daniel a question about which place can reveal the dark side of the human being, Eugene soon replies that no there's no right answer, but he believes that's where they are: a casino,
Lucky Casino
, the 2nd affiliate of the Workers.
Daniel gets excited and accidentally shouts with joy telling Eugene that he will expose the affiliate, but Eugene responds, saying that a casino for foreigners is allowed by the government, since the objective may be the acquisition of foreign currency, like the Seven Luck Casino or Paradise Casino, so Eugene shows Daniel Park that there are no illegalities in the affiliate, which affects Eugene's trust in Daniel Park.
Upon returning home, Daniel realizes and regrets his emotional attitude, and thinks how he could do to get into the 2nd affiliate now, he can think of a method to get into it again.
Then we see
Mary Kim
climbing a huge ladder to find
Vin Jin
, who was pulling trees out of the ground as a form of "training" Vin Jin says that he has returned to his prime, and that he will go after everyone who underestimated him, including
Daniel Park
.
Soon after, we see
Warren Chae
in a small boat, with
Manager Kim
on an island, he seems to have just left a training session with the manager.
In the end, Eugene goes to visit the dark side of the 2nd affiliate and meets with CEO
Mitsuki Soma
, who takes him to see the end of the Circus (the true illegality of the affiliate), he sees
a man with a mask of a dog
, this man has just easily beaten several other men in orange clothes, so he introduces himself to
Eugene
as "chairman"
Episode 373
Daniel Park
sets up a meeting with
Eugene
to talk about joining the
2nd affiliate
, but Eugene doesn't want to allow it, until Daniel makes a proposal to enter with a condition that is yet to be revealed.
Daniel Park thus manages to enter the affiliate, however, for that, he had to leave school, go only with a suitcase that would be searched and he could only leave the place with Eugene's permission.
Eugene
notifies
Samuel Seo
that Daniel Park will be joining the 2nd affiliate, still with the condition undisclosed, Samuel says that, knowing the affiliate, he is worried about
Daniel Park
.
The next day,
Zoe Park
notices that
Daniel
did not go to school and notifies
Zack Lee
, soon after, he goes to the room where
Burn Knuckles
is to warn
Jace Park
and
Vasco
, Zack shows a lot of concern about what may have happened to Daniel .
Vin Jin
and
Mary Kim
go back to school, Vin looks for Daniel Park and does not find him, he warns that Vin Jin from
Cheonliang
is totally different from Vin of
J High
.
Eugene
and
Mandeok Bang
wait for
Daniel Park
to arrive at Lucky Casino, Mandeok Bang searches Daniel and finds nothing suspicious and then proceeds through an elevator, which takes them to the dark side of the 2nd affiliate, there Eugene leaves Daniel without even introducing him to the executives, who are all (or appear to be) Japanese, Daniel, feeling intimidated by them, tries to say something in Japanese, the attempt is interrupted by an executive who is Korean, he mingles and talks with Daniel, until he reveals himself to be
Sinu Han
.
Meanwhile, on
Big Deal
's street,
Jerry Kwon
meets to let
Jake Kim
know that someone is wanting to talk to him, for some reason, Jake misses Sinu even more today.
Episode 374
Sinu asks Daniel who is looking for him. Daniel is about to mention Jake but is interrupted when Mitsuki approaches Sinu telling him not to take his mask off. Daniel bows and shakes hands with Mitsuki, but gets a glare from her. Mitsuki walks away with his arm around Sinu. Nomen then bumps into Daniel on purpose, angering Daniel. Hannya approaches Daniel and puts her hand around Daniel's neck.
The scene cuts to Hannya throwing Daniel against the wall in one of the rooms. Daniel is ready to fight Hannya, but then it is revealed that Hannya is Doo Lee, who wanted to push Daniel away, Doo Lee talks about the place being 100% guarded 24 hours a day, so it's impossible for them to plot anything there, and also introduces the other executives, Daruma, Hyotokko and Nohmen, both three are Japanese, the conversation between Daniel and Doo is interrupted by Nohmen, who enters the room, they quickly pretend a situation where Doo is beating Kitsune (Daniel), after that, Doo Lee showcases the affiliate's shady business.
We see several men, criminals and before anything can be seen, the scene is cut by Daniel, who left the place to vomit, after seeing what happened, after that, the condition of entry for Daniel Park in the 2nd affiliate of the Workers is revealed , he delivered 4 of his friends to fight in the affiliate's obscure business, the "Circus", being chosen by Eugene, Daniel counts on his friends to get through it.
Episode 375
The episode starts with
Sinu Han
in the shower staring at the ceiling after a tournament.
Mitsuki
approaches him from behind and hugs him while nude. She tells him "Great job today, too" in Japanese.
Doo
and
Daniel
are both meeting in Daniel's room. Doo asks Daniel again if Daniel's really planning to make his friends join the Circus. And Daniel confirms. Doo asks Daniel if he's out of his mind especially after Daniel saw what kind of games they plan in the Circus. But Daniel response that it doesn't matter and that he's going to betray the alliance.
Eugene is eating with Neko as
Mandeok
guards behind Eugene and
Nomen
guards behind Neko. Eugene tells Neko that he doesn't believe that Daniel is going to betray the alliance because Daniel was the one who destroyed the 3rd and 4th affiliates. Eugene believes that Daniel is planning to make Workers think that he betrayed the alliance just so he can destroy the 2nd affiliate. So, then Eugene says how he'll make members of the alliance participate in the alliance so that Workers can eliminate them. Eugene thanks Neko for helping him out. Neko thanks Eugene for letting her meet Sinu. But then she her knife at Eugene's neck telling him that if anyone dares to ruin what they have, she will murder them, including Eugene. Mandeok blocks the knife from getting any closer to Eugene and the two continue to talk. Mitsuki wonders if Daniel will form a group to clear the Circus. But Eugene tells her that there's no need to worry about that since Eugene chose specific participants for the Circus.
Warren
,
Sally
and
Zack
meet Daniel's second body in a warehouse. Sally asks why he has called them over. Daniel then notices
Vin Jin
with the group. Vin Jin tells Daniel that he followed Zack to the location and asks Daniel to come at him. However, Zack runs up to Daniel grabbing him by the collar and asking why Daniel skipped school and that Zack was worried for him. But Daniel brushes Zack's hand off.
Eugene steps out from the second floor explaining to the four of them that Daniel has become part of
Workers
and that they've fallen into Workers' trap. Daniel then runs up to Warren, giving him a kick. Daniel puts his kitsune mask on and tells them that he's one of the Workers now. The three of them besides Vin realizes that Daniel has betrayed them. Vin Jin is confused as to what Daniel is talking about, and Daniel wonders why Vin is there. Warren punches Daniel, and realizes that when Daniel was talking with Eugene at the summit, that was when Daniel had betrayed them. Zack asks Eugene if Daniel really did betray them and then he, Vin Jin and Warren surround Daniel asking if he can really take the three of them down.
Vin Jin realizes that he came for nothing and tries to leave, but Nomen's motorcycle is in the air ready to land on Vin Jin. But Vin Jin stops the impact by holding the motorcycle with Nomen with two of his hands causing Nomen to flip him off.
Huttoko
comes and hits Warren from his side. Then

Zack Lee
or
Warren Chae

Hyottoko
grabs
Warren Chae
and throws him into the wall, Warren says he feels the pain, but he doesn't feel the slightest bit that he will lose.

The scene cuts to
Eugene
, finishing making a kind of "rank" for Daniel's five selected friends, Eugene emphasizes that it is impossible for these people to get through the Circus, so Daniel will have to see his friends die in front of him.
Daniel appears in his second body, lying on a bed, Daniel says that Eugene indeed took precautions, but there is one thing Eugene could never have predicted: he has two bodies.

Ryuhei suggests they hire Sekiwake(3rd highest rank in professional sumo wrestling) Sato Kazuma, who was an up-and-comer in the sumo world, but was later expelled from the sport. He then joined the Japanese self-defence forces (JSDF), but deserted both due to insubordination. He was on the run.

However, Big Deal assembles orderly and apologises to Sinu for being late and not being able to come sooner, and that they will not make any excuses. Jake takes the blame for not coming for him sooner. However, Sinu says that Mitsuki told him that some people pretending to be Jake (who he thinks is dead) would come for him. He continues his assault on Big Deal. Even though Big Deal tries to remind Sinu about the truth, he still thinks that that room is Big Deal street and that Mitsuki is Yeonhui. Jake gets up and punches Sinu before he can stomp on Brad, he reminds Sinu of what he said before he left Big Deal, that Jake had to become stronger in order to protect it.

In a flashback, Taesoo Ma calls the ability to attack unseen a type of Mastery. He explains that they attack their opponent's blind spots so quickly the attacks seem to be invisible. He says that only two people have reached this type of Mastery, Elite and James Lee. He also says that maybe one day, someone from the second generation may get there some day.
In the present, Sinu kicks Jake with those invisible attacks. Sinu beats Jake up, but before he can deal the finishing blow to him, Brad, Jason and Jerry step up to protect him. Sinu is confused and tells Mitsuki that he thinks something has gone wrong. Mitsuki responds that its all in his mind and that they are trying to confuse him. Sinu prepares to kick Jerry, but Jake is able to get up and block the blow.
Taesoo Ma then tells the reader that there was one person who could win even though he couldn't see his opponent's attacks. That person was Gapryong Kim.
Gapryong's son hits Sinu with an attack towards his blind eye, but he pauses before landing it and chooses to attack the side where Sinu can see from, exactly like the final fight that Jake and Sinu had before Sinu left Big Deal.

She thinks men are irresponsible trash, selfish and don't know the meaning of sacrifice. Vivi barges into Mitsuki's office, asking her to go to Korea with her. In Korea, while Hotel ViVi is being contructed, Mitsuki meets Eugene. Eugene invites Mitsuki to the underground fighting arena in the 3rd Affiliate. While watching the players fight, she takes Intrest in Sinu. Eugene explains Sinu's story to her, and she decides to buy him off Eugene because she likes him a lot.

Synopsis
Episode 330
Jake
calls
Jerry
and
Lineman
into Hotel Vivi, all three of them disguised with tracksuits.
Mandeok
tells
Eugene
about this and asks if this means they are at war with
Big Deal
now. Eugene says it is not war since there are only three men, but that he won’t sit back and do nothing.
Jake and the team go to
Old Face
who is tied in the bathroom, and he tells them that the captives are on the top floor. To get there, they will need to take a badge from one of the four executives of the
Workers
third affiliate: Hwang Ho, Taegon Wi, Sowol Jin and Huseong Ha.
Daniel
is captured in a tub when he wakes up. The rich kids are screaming for him to be murdered, and
Viv
i concocts a stronger version of hydrochloric acid to melt him with.
Jake Kim calls
Zack Lee
and tells him that the Workers have Daniel, and Zack calls
Vasco
and
Eli
to Hotel Vivi. Hwang Ho is angry that he lost to Vasco, and is preparing to crush him.
Samuel Seo
gets a call from the Workers allowing him to dispatch to the third affiliate.
Zack arrives on a bicycle and finds the other two waiting for them, but the three of them are blocked by
Johan Seong
. He refuses to move since
Xiaolong
promised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job.
Episode 331
The suited up worker is about to spill acid on Daniel when he trips and spills it on the ground. The bodyguards ask what he is doing and he bodies them while Daniel uses Sophia's bone squeeze escape technique to run out of the room. The worker removes his mask and reveals that he is Doo Lee, and he wanted to repay Daniel for the troubles he gave him at the convenience store.
Zack, Vasco and Eli are fighting Johan and they are all having a difficult time. The two of them grab Johan's legs and tell Eli to go ahead without them. When he disappears inside, Zack tells Vasco that he should go as well to help save people, although he is not sure if he can beat Johan.
Xiaolong tells a hotel couple to stay inside since there is a disturbance in the hotel. He is surprised that Daniel turned out to be one of the intruders, and he wonders if there are others working with him. Huseong hits Daniel out from the bathroom and prepares to kill him. Lineman steps out from his hiding place and tells Huseong to leave Daniel alone since he's just a kid. He tells Daniel to run and that he'll be fine, since he is a member of Big Deal, despite being afraid himself.
Eli Jang walks through the kitchen when he is attacked by Taegon Wi. He draws his weapon, but then realizes he brought Yenna's toy wand instead of his baton.
Episode 332
Xiaolong is informed about the intruders, who are fighting executives. He tells the guard to tell the executives they can kill any intruder. He locks Vivi in her room and guards the outside.
Taegon Wi grew up without a family in China. He was targeted by kidnappers as a kid, and he did whatever he could to survive. When he became older he was approached by Xiaolong who offered him a position. Although he has been in Korea for some time, he hasn’t found any opponents as strong as those in China.
Taegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli’s baton away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.
Lineman is still standing after taking a beating from Huseong. Huseong asks why his tattoos aren’t colored in, because it looks amateur. Lineman says he can’t color them because Jake called him Lineman. Huseong decides to end things when Jerry comes out of the bathroom. Lineman asks Jerry if his act was worthy of Big Deal before passing out.
Episode 333
Huseong Ha was abandoned at a zoo when he was a newborn. A male gorilla decided to raise him, and he treated it like his mother. The authorities took Huseong out and he entered society, but he was always curious about why humans are weak. He joined the army and later founded the Gorilla gang. Later on, his gang was sold to the Bicheon gang by the authorities. Xiaolong approached him at dinner and asked him to help protect someone.
Huseong asks Jerry if he is trying so hard because Jake is watching him. Jake offers to get the badge for Jerry but he tells Jake to take Lineman and Daniel and leave. Once they are gone, Jerry punches Huseong into the wall, and his head breaks a hole into it. Huseong realizes Jerry was hiding his strength to not outshine Jake. Lineman returns and sees the wreckage, and Jerry tells him not to reveal that he is stronger than Jake. Vasco comes across Hwang Ho and uses Brekdak’s 7th forbidden move, dough kneading. Hwang sees it coming and blocks the attack.
Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he’s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn’t need help, since Johan is reliable enough. Samuel offers to help out if Xiaolong barks like a dog.
Episode 334
Jake takes Daniel and Tiktaktok girl to a room so they can pretend to be guests, warning them not to leave. Daniel asks the girl to go to sleep, and he tries to turn into his other body but it won’t wake up. Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.
The disfigured men attack Eli and he is surprised how little they care about being damaged. They even injure each other trying to kill him. Elsewhere, Vasco tries to get the badge from Hwang but the henchmen grab him. They are doused with gasoline, and they light a match while holding Vasco. The three musketeers are climbing the elevator when they arrive at a floor filled with the disfigured henchmen. They are even on top of the elevator.
Samuel explains that during the Great Chinese Fire, 103 children were burned. Xiaolong took them in and turned them into warriors to protect Vivi. They are part of the Bicheon gang (Bi meaning queen, Cheon meaning sky and heaven). Samuel doesn’t think they are as strong as Big Deal however. Jake, Jerry and Lineman mow down the men and arrive at Vivi’s room.
Episode 335
Vasco managed to avoid being burned, and the fire alarms have been turned on. In the wet, Vasco, Eli and Big Deal try to fend off the Bicheon gang, but they keep rising back up. Jerry grabs Lineman by the head and clears a path for Jake. Lineman pulls down a grate to block the horde.
The three of them face Xiaolong. Vivi breaks open the door and yells at Xiaolong for locking her inside, but he tells her to stay there and closes the door again, locking it with his spear. He tells Jake he will have to kill him if he wants to enter the door. Jake tells Xiaolong he isn’t protecting Vivi simply out of loyalty, and the flashback begins.
Xiaolong was among 108 unregistered Chinese children. He participated in a brutal match where he had to slaughter his fellow brothers in order to be recognized by Vivi’s father. He took him in as a guard to watch over Vivi. Xiaolong throws away Lineman and knocks Jerry into the ground.
Xiaolong says that Big Deal have already failed since their reinforcements are coming (Johan). Johan makes his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he’s working with the third affiliate when they’re responsible for the Punsang cult.
Episode 336
Sowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. Jerry is fighting Xiaolong and he wishes to have seen his weapon, and Xiaolong says it wouldn’t make a difference. He remembers killing his mutinous brothers and sisters when they decided to rise against Vivi. He trained hard to be able to protect Vivi with or without a weapon. Jake steps in to continue the fight for Jerry, who is out cold.
Episode 337
Xiaolong recalls when he sent Taegon Wi to monitor Jake Kim, going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well. He is shocked to see how powerful Jake was. Gun hears people comparing him to Xiaolong and says he would have to fight him in order to see how strong he truly is.
Jake tells Xiaolong that he’s going to take Vivi to get information about the Workers No.8, Sinu Han. Jake runs towards Vivi’s room and Xiaolong races after him. Jake throws the spear at Xiaolong, and when he’s dodging he grabs his head and slams him into the ground. With Xialong incapacitated, he walks to Vivi’s door.
Xiaolong recalls being promoted to Cheon No.1 by the current master Jiou Jeon. He is taught Cheon Hohuigong, a martial art that is passed down to the Cheon guards. It’s about making the body into a weapon. Xiaolong declines the offer to protect the chairman because he wants to protect Vivi. Gun continues his narration by saying he would have had to fight Xiaolong because he doesn’t know how he would fare against his martial art. In present day Xiaolong rises again to fight.
Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.
Episode 338
Xiaolong starts using his broken arm as a whip. When Xiaolong dodges his fingers he slashes him in the face with his hair, which is concealing blades.
Hwang Ho recalls meeting with his peers: Huseong Ha of Gorilla gang, King Gon Taegon Wi, Hongwol Sowol Jin and Hwang Ho. Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest by fighting, and Hwang decided to challenge him. When Hwang asked why they were fighting, Taegon said because he is obviously the strongest of the four.
Hwang Ho decides he will go full force for Vasco, and Vasco warns him that people die from Brekdak’s five most powerful skills. They prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away. Daniel starts climbing outside the hotel so he can get to the penthouse.
Eli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan says to give the badge or else he will kill him.
Episode 339
Gun is asked how strong Eli is compared to the others. He says Eli could have been strong if he continued fighting, but he took a three year break. Without doing any training in that time, the others would have surely surpassed him. However, Eli has been doing some training. When Tom Lee found out Eli had a daughter, he kidnapped her. He kept her away from Eli until Eli regained his animal instincts: namely, being sneaky with stronger opponents. In one month he managed to win back Yenna from Tom.
Johan throws Eli’s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna’s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.
Jerry and Lineman wake up and are shocked to see Jake scarred from his fight. Jake tells Xiaolong he didn’t want to get serious, because he was losing his mind thinking about revenge. He’s willing to drop the facade for Xiaolong and pretend that he is Gun.
Episode 340
The juvenile detention guards are chatting about their worst inmates when one of them brings up Gun Park. He used to fight the most violent inmates every day, staining the walls with their blood. Jake Kim surpassed him though, making the bloodstains even higher.
Xiaolong gets beat into another flashback. He remembers Vivi giving him his name Xiaolong, meaning “Little Dragon”. Vivi wanted to befriend Xiaolong, but he never had time for her because he didn’t want to indulge in her feelings. She even confessed to him but he apologized and said he didn’t deserve her. Xiaolong eventually became a eunuch so he could protect Vivi without her father’s suspicion.
Jake breaks Xiaolong’s two arms, and he tries to attack with his mouth. Jake grabs hold of Xiaolong and warns him that if he continues, he may never walk again. Xiaolong says he never intended to walk away from this battle, and Jake breaks his legs.
Jake opens the door for Vivi and tells her they are leaving. Vivi says that she isn’t leaving without Xiaolong and she sees him broken on the ground. Xiaolong crawls to Vivi and she runs to embrace him. Vivi and Xiaolong cry together, and he barks like a dog. Samuel hears him and smirks.
Episode 341
Daniel gets to the penthouse and releases the tied up influencers. They tell him there’s one more guy locked in another room, and he goes to investigate.
Xiaolong tells Samuel he will do whatever he wants if he protects Vivi. Samuel says he doesn’t want to. He was ordered by Eugene to help him break up the third affiliate’s current leadership, since they’re causing trouble. He wanted to make use of Vivi’s relationship with her father, but the leader of T Company refused to do business with them. If Samuel can bring Vivi to Eugene, he will be able to run the third affiliate.
Samuel mocks Xiaolong and tells Jake they are allies now. Jake asks what he is going to do with Vivi, because he needs her to tell him where Sinu is. Samuel says he will tell him about Sinu later but Jake doesn’t trust him, and they start fighting. As they are fighting, Daniel is thrown out between them. He warns them to run. The lights start flickering and influencers run away screaming. Daniel’s second body appears in ultra instinct form.
Episode 342
Daniel tries to understand why his second body is moving on its own. Samuel and Jake try to attack UI Daniel, but they aren’t doing damage. Jake is ashamed of fighting double, but at the moment all he can think of is survival. Jerry offers to help in spite of his fear. He gathers all his strength into one punch, but Daniel uses the punch to power his own kick. Jake takes the shot and is knocked into a building.
Samuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.
Episode 343
Johan’s past enemies and friends hype up how powerful he is as he’s fighting Daniel’s UI form. Samuel and Jake watch the two of them fight. UI Daniel uses the kyokushin and a triple kick on Johan, followed by systema and capoeira.While Johan is simply copying moves, Daniel has mastered them. Johan keeps fighting in hopes that he can copy Daniel’s moves and gain some experience for fighting Gun. He is eventually overpowered. Daniel is about to step on him when Goo arrives, carrying Xiaolong’s spear. He takes in the situation and then gets serious with Daniel.
Episode 344
Goo pretends he isn’t interested in fighting Daniel before slicing at him with the spear. Daniel dodges it and the two of them begin fighting. Goo keeps on rambling and looking for openings, but Daniel isn’t letting up. Daniel breaks his weapon and Goo becomes serious for once.
Logan Lee arrives in the elevator to see Goo lying on the ground, bloodied and with a broken arm. Daniel is unconscious on the ground. Goo complains to Logan that he had to use
batto
, and Goo corrects him that he used Korean kendo instead.
Logan picks up Vivi and Xiaolong to take with him. Daniel tells him to leave them there or he’ll kill him. Daniel remembers telling Sophia that the other reason he wanted to become strong was so he could beat Logan Lee, since he can also copy moves.
Episode 345
Goo knocks out Logan and tells him to not cause any trouble. They have a stare down and Logan leaves. Jake tells Goo he can’t take Vivi and Xiaolong. Goo asks if he can put a pause on his revenge scheme since there will be a war soon. He asks Jake to let him go just this once, and Jake begrudgingly obliges.
Vasco wakes up and is disappointed in his loss, vowing to be the main character next time. Zack is also depressed from his loss, and the fact that he cannot help his friend. He is filled with grief and his chest starts feeling hot. Samuel walks to Jake and asks if he still wants information from Vivi. Jake says Goo already left, but Samuel mentions there’s a basement in Club Vivi that only the executives can go to. He says Jake can still meet Sinu if he wants.
Episode 346
Samuel takes Jake to the basement, where there is a lit room with a stage and multiple bleachers. Sinu used to fight here in the Workers’ underground fighting ring. He and other prisoners were treated like animals and had to fight year long under grueling conditions. Samuel used to talk to Sinu during his breaks, but Sinu only remembered Jake and how he would save him. Samuel wondered if it was a side effect of the drugs he was taking. He would give him a pen to write with so he could have some amount of freedom, and Sinu would write on the walls. He filled the walls and the floor with the names of the Big Deal members so he wouldn't forget. Jake demands Samuel tell him where SInu is captured. He tells Jake that Sinu was moved to a bigger stadium, and that he brought him to this room to have a private place to speak. Samuel also says he will help him find Sinu if Jake helps him become king.
Daniel returns home and is upset that he didn’t do much, but happy that everyone is safe. He managed to steal some of Vivi’s cookies, so he plans on giving it to Steve Hong. He bumps into DG and drops the cookie, which the latter picks up and says he will be confiscating.

Synopsis
Episode 287
A streamer, Jamie, has a bruise on her arm and the viewers quickly point it out to her. The viewers also comment on the lack of sleep she was getting, and the high amount of food she was eating. One streamer tells her to pick up a strawberry if she was kidnapped, and Jamie does so. Some of the viewers are skeptical, while others are concerned for her. Under the table, two grown men glare at her and urge to her behave. The introduction ends.
Amy
and
Natalie
apply to a job at MCN. They get the job quickly after
Samuel
, the CEO, sees that they do not have a background. He introduces them to the five most popular Kwitch streamers, which the two girls find strange.
At school,
Daniel
holds up the One MCN card that
Gun
had given him and observes it, wondering what he should do.
Doo Lee
walks up to him, fascinated. He says that he had been trying to get into streaming. He watched Doo Lee stream, but the viewers are not happy.
At home, Daniel tries it again in his old body, and instantly gets many people to watch him. He shows them what a loser he was in school, and the audience finds it relatable.
The next day, Daniel goes to MCN in his new body while carrying his old body in a suitcase. He has a brief encounter with Samuel, who confirms that he is a member of
Workers.
[

]
Episode 288
Samuel
admits that he is a member of the
Workers
, which stands for “The Union of One Hundred Billion Dollars”, and that their goal is to make that amount. He asks
Daniel
if there is a problem, and Daniel has no response. Samuel gives him an interview and says he wants Daniel to work with them since he is great at building an audience. Daniel tells
Doo
that he is going to the J Star convention where big streamers meet, and Doo tells Daniel he owes him something.
Like What
and
Hilarious
look around in awe at the convention, and then race to the table of the top five Kwitch streamers, the “Royal Five”. One of the five members,
a girl wearing a red panda suit
, tells them not to trust the company too much. Daniel comes into the building and greets the two girls, but they don’t recognize his fat body.
Samuel looks at some pictures of Daniel and wonders if he will cause trouble to the Workers. Daniel asks to see what is in the room and Samuel tells him not to interrupt, and then goes to the bathroom. Daniel tests the voice recognition of the door but it doesn’t work. Then he pulls out the ONE MCN card
Gun
gave him and the door unlocks.
Episode 289
Daniel
sneaks into the room and sees photos of himself, as well as a wall with the crew heads taped onto it.
Olly Wang
’s head is crossed out, and the crew heads are numbered. He is about to leave when he sees
one of the streamers
blocking the doorway, the short one with an odd mouth. Daniel hides under the table with him as
Samuel
bursts into the room and then leaves.
Daniel decides to sign the contract since he didn’t get much information. Samuel gives the contract papers and the girls are eager to sign, but
the girl in the racoon outfit
snatches the papers and tells them to read beforehand so they are not scammed. After striking out some clauses, she hands back the papers and they sign.
Warren
brings some fried chicken for the girls but
Sally
tells them the girls are staying at their workplace apartment.
Like What
and
Hilarious
wake up later and find themselves in their room. They see a chat with foreign people typing, and a camera that won’t stop recording. They call for help and the girl in the racoon outfit tells them they should have read the contract more carefully, and to listen to the viewers requests or they will face consequences by the gangsters under their desk. Daniel wakes up in his own room to find he is locked, but when he calls for help he is hit on the back of the head with a baseball bat by gangsters. He passes out but remembers he brought his second body along as luggage.
Episode 290
Daniel
is making an imprisonment journal about what's happening to him under MCN. Daniel orders a lot of chicken for his other body to deliver it in the place where he is locked. Daniel's second body finds the place and is going to fight
Samuel Seo
.
Warren Chae
is looking for
Like What
and
Hilarious
.
Episode 291
Daniel
punches
Samuel Seo
but Samuel Seo has witnesses and guards call his legal team. Samuel Seo threatens Daniel that if he doesn't walk away he is going to call the cops and will sue him for accusing them and making a violent act against MCN. Daniel walks away and is frustrated because he felt so defeated.
Warren Chae
asks Daniel if he saw
Like What
and
So Funny
, Daniel tells Warren about what's happening to them, Warren says he will beat the Workers but Daniel stops him because it's too dangerous. Warren gets mad and tells Daniel he has 3 seconds to tell him why he shouldnt beat them. Daniel asks
Kouji's
help to how he can get it without causing any ruckus, Kouji tells him about how badges work in
Workers
and tells him that the badge he have is called the Black Badge which means that badge is only for the VVIP. Daniel gets in the ONE MCN building and meets
the Worker's President
.
Episode 292
Daniel
tells
the president
that he wants a tour and wants
Mr. Kim
as his tour guide. Daniel asks Mr. Kim where they locked the minor streamers and Mr.Kim says he doesn't know what he's talking about. This causes the other members of
Workers
to laugh as well, and Daniel asks where
Samuel Seo's
office is.
Warren
tries to climb all of the stairs until he realizes that there must be a secret floor on the building. He gets in the elevator where he saw Mr. Kim and asks him where Like What and So Funny are. Daniel gets in Samuel Seo's office and meets
Goo
in there.
Episode 293
Goo
asks
Daniel
if he got the badge from
Gun
, and he asks what Daniel did for Gun in return. Daniel says he agreed to be Gun's successor, and
Goo
asks whether he was supposed to get rid of the four crews. He tells Daniel that if he becomes his secret friend, he will let him know how to defeat the Workers. When Daniel refuses, Goo tells him he will respect his wish, but he dislikes liars. He flips Daniel over and knocks him out.
The president
puts on a fight for
Doo
to watch, where he makes the security team fight each other. Doo is impessed and intimidated by this gesture.
Warren
fights
Senior Manager Kim
in the elevator. Manager Kim asks where he learned Jeet Kune Do. Warren asks how he can do this kind of job while being a father, and Manager Kim says he will do anything for his family. When they descend to Doo's floor the president berates the manager, but he tells him that Warren and his friends are frauds. Warren tells Doo to tell Daniel to find Like What and So Funny, real names
Amy
and
Natalie
.
Episode 294
The president
beats
manager Kim
and asks how he could allow this to happen. In a flashback,
Daniel
tells
Warren
and
Doo
he expects to be caught and that in case Warren should cause a ruckus. Daniel's small body frees the girls from their cells and they go to every imprisoned streamer to save them. On his way out he runs into Mr. Gold, who instead of helping him, punches him the face. He takes off his wig and smirk and reveals that he is the president of the company, and he wanted to keep an eye on Daniel from the start. He wonders where Daniel got a black badge, since he asked the VVIPs and none of them confirmed. He asks if Daniel is conspiring with
Samuel
behind his back, and brings the security back to round up the streamers.
Warren and Doo are brought to the president and he berates the security team again on their mishaps. He beats up Samuel and tells him he should be grateful for all he has done. Daniel shows up holding the beaten security guards and greets everyone before informing them that they are disqualified for illegal actions. The president asks how Daniel can prove the illegal matters. Daniel throws the illegal contracts in the president's face, and tells him that the Workers are disqualified from the four crews. He managed to get these files by using his black badge on the locked safe.
Episode 295
Charles Choi
asks
Tom Lee
to help the fourth affiliate out, and offers a large sum of money for it. Tom calls his men from the White Tiger agency to help them:

. The two of them fight
Daniel
and
Warren
, but are defeated in the end.

are arguing with each other, so Senior Manager Kim attacks Warren and Daniel. The two of them team up to fight Senior Manager Kim, who they discover has been holding back in the previous fight.
Goo
arrives at a construction site to meet Charles Choi. Choi asks why the fourth affiliate was exposed, and Goo tells him that
Gun
is responsible for the crews. Tom Lee, the fighting genius interrupts them and asks Goo how he's been.
Episode 296
Goo
is pissed off seeing
Tom
, and he asks if
Charles Choi
was suspicious of him. Choi tells him that he meant to give Goo a bonus for his hard work, and that he didn't mean to upset him. When Goo leaves, Tom tells Charles that he doesn't work for money. Choi grants him a building. Tom Lee calls his men back from the fourth affiliate, and
the president
tries to buy them back.
Manager Kim
tells
Daniel
that they will probably meet again seeing as there are four affiliates in total. Daniel tries to call out to him but he feels his body burning. The president asks
Samuel
to do something about the mess, and Samuel simply smirks at him.
The president starts to cry and remembers the many times he asked Samuel to do something for him. He says that Gun's opinion of him doesn't matter, and Samuel gets triggered. He washes his arms and asks Daniel why
Gun
doesn't approve of him. He fought all the crew heads and none of them could give him an answer. Gun elsewhere reveals that he doesn't approve of Samuel because he is too vicious and confused. Daniel reveals that he stole Samuel's brass knuckles. He starts to feel excited to fight, a feeling that is not coming from him but from his body.

Warren
grabs the door and tells Samuel to not be cowardly, but Samuel points out that Daniel is also armed and enjoying the fight.
The president

Tom Lee
completely brushes off
Warren's
hits and bites him in the face before slamming him into the ground. He tells Warren that he taught
another kid
wildness, and he should be the same age as him. He tells the boys that he is only there to break up One MCN, and asks
Samuel
if that's why he is so calm. Samuel says he wants to show respect to the one who raised his bosses. Tom asks if Samuel knew he would be there, and he refuses. Samuel thanks Daniel for being his cameo, and he tells
the president
no hard feelings. Tom decides to take the president with him.
Daniel
asks where to rescue the streamers and Tom tells him they've been transferred to the third affiliate already. Daniel tries to fight him but gets knocked out. He goes into ultra instinct mode and is still knocked out.
Manager Kim
is driving with his coworkers and the girls. He tells the men to stop the car, and they ask if he knows what it means to quit the White Tiger center. He still decides to fight them and release the girls.
Episode 299
Senior Manager Kim
drops the girls off at home and
Warren
is reunited with them.
Daniel
also returns home with many questions about the
Workers
and their intentions. After One MCN dissolved, they were acquired by
Charles Choi
. He hid a spy cam in his coffee cup, and wants to investigate the footage of what happened during his break in.
Samuel Seo
calls the entirety of
K-House
over to some street. He asks
Jin Jang
to light his cigar and
Seth Lee
decides to instead, to save his face. Samuel tells them they passed and he is willing to train them to become the best of the Workers affiliates.
Johan
visits
Justin
and
Chuck
at a food stall and asks if they know where
Gun
is. They tell him they don't, and they're also too busy to search for him.
Zack
sits down next to him and asks Johan if he's ready to go home now. Johan says he's never listened to Zack before, so the latter decides to beat him and take him home regardless.
Notes
At the start of the arc, Daniel is dressed like the character Tanjiro from Demon Slayer, except that his robe is blue.

"
You want to get in there? Then it’s simple. You’ll have to kill me first
"
—Xiaolong  in
episode
335
Xiaolung (샤오룽
Shaorung
)
is the Director of Workers' 3rd Affiliate, and the sworn protector of
Vivi
.
Appearance
Xiaolong
Xiaolung has a figure of tall, and lean appearance. He is a man of composed manner. He is usually seen with a black suit, similar to the bouncers of Club ViVi.
Xiaolung sports a long, black hair that is twin braided and parted in the middle. Both of his eyebrows are slit.
It is unusual that he dons a ring with the worker's golden badge on it unlike the other executives who wears the badge on their jacket.
He keeps a composed facial expression and is never shown to smile or reveal any emotions.
Personality
Xiaolung is a man of a composed manner. He is willing to sacrifice his own life for Vivi's safety. He is shown to be very gentle with Vivi, carrying her around whenever she's high and even picking up a cup of water for her to drink. Being brainwashed from a young age, he has a warped worldview however is shown to retain some sort of morals.
Relationships
Vivi
He was picked up by Vivi's Father to be her bodyguard as a young orphan with nowhere to go. He was brainwashed to believe that Vivi is an ultimate being. A "god-like" or "angel-like" being by her Dad, therefore putting her life over his at any moment in time. She is all that is important to him, nothing else matters to him but her safety. He is close to Vivi, being her right-hand man and being with her since they were children.
[

]
Synopsis
History
Xiaolung is of Chinese background coming to Korea in order to stay by Vivi's side. Xiaolung works for Vivi's father, a billionaire, and his only job is to protect Vivi. He has been protecting Vivi ever since she was a little girl.
Just like Gun, he recruits many different talents to join the executive crew to protect Vivi. One of them includes Taegon Wi, whom he recruited from the streets at a very young age. He also leads the Bicheon Gang which consists of 103 fire survivors from an incident.
Before meeting Vivi and her dad, as a child, he was among 108 unregistered people— no identity, nationality, or family. He was shown in bloodshed where he had killed his ‘brothers’ he'd grown up with and that ends with him earning his ‘right’. He was then introduced to Vivi— someone who [he] is going to protect forever, someone [he] has to give his life for.
After fighting Jake Kim in the Hunt for Big Deal and realizing the truth, Xiaolung returned to China just in time to stop Vivi's arranged marriage and ran away with her so they could finally be together.
Fighting Prowess
Protecting ViVi
Xiaolung is a proficient fighter, stated to be on par with Gun by
Old Face
.
[
2
]
His weapon of choice is a
Guandao
and blades in his hair. Despite that, Xiaolung's fighting style has no difference whether or not he is physically holding the Guandao, being able to replicate the movements with the Guandao with nothing in his hand, making it appear as though he is striking with an unclenched fist. This martial art style is highly secretive, entitled "
Cheon Hohuigong".
He is immensely strong, enduring, and overwhelming Jerry Kwon with little difficulty and only later matched by Jake Kim after he trained for months in prison to surpass Gun. However, Xiaolung exhibits great durability and grit, having fought even after having his elbow dislocated by Jake. In fact, Xiaolung decided to fight with his broken arm like a whip.
Quotes
Forgive me... I am merely a sword to protect you
It will be fine. And even if it’s not fine... I’ll make sure it is

You want to get in there? Then it’s simple. You’ll have to kill me first

]
Trivia
Xiaolung is fluent in 4 languages: Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English.
Xiaolung's weapon is stated to be a Scimitar in the official English release, however, this is most likely a translation error or poor choice of localisation as a Scimitar is a curved blade of Middle-Eastern origin.

Yenna,
nicknamed
Zami
by
Zack
, is a minor character in Lookism. She is the daughter of
Eli Jang
And
Heather
and is the youngest member of
Hostel B
.
Appearance
She shares her mother's her big black eyes and has brown hair, which is odd, since both Eli and Heather share black hair. One can assume that both of them shared this recessive trait or Eli simply dyed it. The combination of these two traits gave her a strikingly similar appearance to
Mira
, so much so that even Zack mistook her for Mira's child.
Yenna is shown to usually wear a yellow frock with collars and a front pocket. She wears yellow shoes with white socks.
Personality
Yenna is a toddler and has yet to develop a personality of her own, she is usually seen smiling innocently at everyone. However, in the time she spent with Mira and Zack, it was shown that she shared a lot of parallels with Zack. Both of them find it troublesome to meet new people but quickly open up to them and try to show as much kindness to them, Yenna acted so much like Zack that the officer at the police station commented that if they didn't know any better, he could be mistaken as her father.
Relationships
Eli Jang
As her father and only guardian, Yenna loves her father a lot. According to Eli, she is the greatest gift he ever had, even if she may be troublesome. He works very hard for her and looks after her even during his work all while juggling with his school work too. He is very protective of Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he has ever got.
A God Dog threatens to hurt Yena.
He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew, when they threatened to hurt Yenna.
He usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna, as can be seen when he did not protest even though some of the God Dogs treated him harshly.
When Choi Soo Jung volunteered to look after Yenna, he was very hesitant as he did not want her to leave his eyesight. He probably had this attitude from the beginning itself, but it must have been reinforced after Yenna went missing for the first time.
Eli is noted to be a very good father by
Crystal Choi
.
Zack Lee
Jin Sung holding "Zami" (Yena).
At first, Zack found her troublesome but soon his affection grew for her as he realized how adorable she was. When she went missing, he was very desperate to find her, even though he was severely injured.
By the time he and
Mira
returned her to the police station, he was so overprotective of her, the officer at work commented that he could be mistaken as her father.
He is the one who nicknamed her
Zami
(in the English version), which is his and Mi Jin's names combined.
Mira Kim
Mira found her at the restaurant where she and Zack were supposed to have their date. She took care of Yenna till Zack came and suggested that they take her to the police station. She is very fond of her and rather protective of her.
She was very angry when Yenna went missing under Zack's watch. Since she didn't want Yenna to go missing again, she had put her phone number in Yenna's pocket, which shows how much she cared for Yenna.
Crystal Choi
Yenna is shown to be fond of Crystal. This is also the reason why Crystal volunteered to take care of her while Eli worked.
Synopsis
Background
Yenna is the daughter of Eli Jang and his Sweetheart Heather. After her birth, Eli stopped being a thug after Heather's death and began working hard to support her.

Overview
Yodo Muramasa (淀村正)
is a katana sword in Lookism, it is known for its ability to slice through even Black Bone.
History
Possibly kept in the inventory of the Yamazaki Syndicate, the Yodo Muramasa was used by Shintaro Yamazaki during his rebellion to seize control of the Syndicate. Using it, Shintaro was able to cut off Shingen Yamazaki's left arm, as both he and his brother possessed the Black Bone at birth. Later on the night of the rebellion, the Yodo Muramasa was used along with several other swords to kill Shingen Yamazaki.
More than 5 years later, after Gun Park's return to Japan. Shintaro overwhelms Gun with his strength and immobilizes him to execute him with the Yodo Muramasa, however, Somi Park instinctively steps in front of the attack, killing her. After that, Gun enters a state of unconsciousness similar to Shingen's, thus defeating and killing Shintaro with his own hands.
This night was the last where the Yodo Muramasa was seen in the series.

episode TBA
Yong Lee is a minor character in Lookism. He is a senior at Gian High School and the ex-boyfriend of
Yui Kim
.
Appearance
Yong Lee has a slim but muscular build. His skin is light beige and covered in tattoos from his right pectoral to his right elbow. His hair is the colour of terracotta and brushed back away from his face, which is partially obscured by a pair of large shades. According to
Zack Lee
, Yong "looks like a gangster"
[

]
.
Personality
Yong is cocky and self-assured, convinced of his own greatness and presumptuous enough to vocalize it. He blusters and boasts without presenting any evidence to validate his allegations, in one instance claiming that "men don't feel cold,"
[
3
]
despite having goosebumps obvious enough for others to notice. His insistence that the goosebumps are actually a result of his atopy demonstrates that when his word is called into question, he resorts to lying.
So too does he resort to violence. Yong's egotism is accompanied by a foul temper and a predilection towards excessive brutality. He has a volatile nature, being quick to anger and quick to react to the emotion with behavior that the average person would consider extreme. He attempts to strike
Daniel Park
for his unresponsiveness, assaults
Yui Kim
upon learning that the gifts she'd given him were originally meant for Daniel, and starts a fight with
Zack Lee
after the boy criticized him for his abuse of Yui.

Synopsis
Paprika TV Arc
Yui was introduced to be one of the top streamers by
Duke
. After watching Daniel and Duke perform, she meets Daniel (in his new body) in class and starts flirting with him, stating that his performance was great. After that, Yui starts being exceedingly generous to Daniel, even offering him a wallet of an expensive brand. Startled at such a gift, Daniel rejects the present, stating that it is too much. Yui then seduces him with a flirty yet innocent look in her eyes. Daniel blushes and realizes that she may be interested in him. From then on, he starts to have a crush on her.
During class, Zoe asks her friends if they want to go to karaoke. While everyone else in the group agrees to go, Yui states that she would prefer to go shopping. Everyone instantly changes their mind and decides to go shopping instead. When they all go shopping, Zoe brings out a light blue pouch with a picture of a doll and asks if she should buy it. Everyone else turns to Yui to wait for her opinion and she says that it looks ugly and that it doesn't suit her. Everyone else immediately agrees, which Zoe all sullen.
Next morning, Zoe sees that Yui has the exact same pouch and gets confused by that fact that she called it ugly and then proceeded to buy it. When she tries to confront Yui about it, Yui and her friends ignore her and pretend that she didn't even say anything. Daniel enters the room and Zoe becomes delighted, but then she sees Yui flirt with him, with him shyly flirting back.
Later that night, Yui continues broadcasting, acting all innocent and cute. She watches as some viewers were competing to see who could pay her more and she smiles sadistically. Yui then talks about how she started playing 'Heroes of the Storm' and asks her viewers if they want to challenge her in the game. A while after all the broadcasting had ended, Yui starts to take out a cigarette and smoke, just before a boy uncovers himself from under the blankets. He gets agitated and asks how long they are going to keep their relationship a secret, and Yui calls him a 'goof'.
She then proceeds to smile innocently while stating that people won't give her any balloons if they find out that she has a boyfriend and gives her boyfriend the wallet which she tried to give Daniel. Thrilled at such an expensive gift, Yui's boyfriend says that he can suck it up. Yui gets on top of him and acts all sweet and caring, only to think that he's a bore and she then starts to wonder what Daniel is up to.
[

]
Daniel, wanting to make sure that she'll accept his old body, asks Yui of what she thinks of fat people. She states that 'people are still people' and Daniel gets pleased at her response. He then thinks of her as 'innocent', 'sweet' and 'different from the other girls' while Yui smiles at him sweetly. Yui then proceeds to smile wickedly at Zoe in a sinister way while Zoe watches them in misery.
While Daniel, Duke and Park Ji Ho hang out together, Kim Hui sits in front of her computer in anger as she stares at how high Zoe's rankings have become. Desperately wanting to be better than Zoe, Yui tries to act cute and innocent by saying that she 'poo-pooed', only to realize that just sounds weird. Even then, people give her balloons because they think she's cute and Yui sits there, gladdened, stating that pretty people get paid, no matter what.
Afterwards, Yui and her boyfriend go to the shop which the old body of Daniel works at and Daniel gets thrilled to see Kim Yuk there and thinks that her boyfriend is actually just her brother. When Kim Yuk and her boyfriend bring a pack of condoms to counter, Daniel gets confused and asks himself why siblings would want to buy such an adult product together. Kim Yuk notices him staring at the box and asks if he's ever seen those before and calls him a pig.
He then sees that Yui's acting rude and he gazes at her in confusion, not saying anything. Her boyfriend, noticing him gazing at her, orders him to lower his eyes and says that he knows what Daniel is thinking when he looks at her. Yui glares at Daniel and coldly muttered that he makes her sick, which shows even more of her true colors. Daniel then gets reminded of how kind Yui acted towards him in his new body, not realizing that he was still gawking at her. She then tells her boyfriend that she thinks he's a pervert and her boyfriend immediately swings his arm at Daniel, only to have Daniel dodge it — to everyone's surprise. Getting embarrassed that he missed, Yui's boyfriend tries to punch Daniel again, only to be stopped by Zack. Zack calmly asks Yui's boyfriend to not hit Daniel, since he owes Daniel something. Yui's boyfriend, annoyed by this statement, goes towards Zack to fight, calling him 'arrogant' and 'a disrespectful kid'.
Zack notices the expensive branded wallet in Yui's boyfriend's hand, which Yui first tried to give to Daniel, and Zack states that she's nervy. He asks in surprise that she had a boyfriend all along and her boyfriend stares at him in confusion, not knowing what was going on. Zack then informs that she tried to give it to Daniel but he refused it, and Yui gets shocked.
Yui, not wanting her boyfriend to know, says that he's lying and pleads to her boyfriend so then that they could leave. Yui's boyfriend, interested, stops Yui and asks Zack to go on. To Yui's horror, Zack explains that Yui secretly loves a 'pretty boy' in her class and likes to give him presents, and that the 'pretty boy' likes her too. After going on about how she loves him and tries to get his attention, Yui's enraged boyfriend punches her in the nose, making it bleed. He continues to kick her body while she's on the ground and step on her head, and this shocks and angers Zack.
Zack walks towards Yui's boyfriend and says that he shouldn't hit a girl. This annoys her boyfriend and he tries to harm Zack, even though Zack kept punching him back. After finally beating Yui's boyfriend with his own two hands, Zack states that 'you should not hit a flower, even if it's with a girl' even though it's actually meant to be 'you should not hit a girl, even if it's with a flower'. Right then, Yui becomes grateful towards Zack and falls in love with him.

Yui comes back to school with her face bruised. She approaches Daniel and Zack's seat with a handkerchief. To the surprise of Zack, instead of giving it to Daniel she offers it to Zack instead, thankful that he protected her. She also states that she broke it off with her boyfriend.

Yujae Seon to Jake Kim in Ep. 558
Yujae Seon
is a member of the
1st Generation
and is the other King of Incheon. He was once a member of the
Speed Faction
before betraying them and becoming a member and now leader of the
Dark Faction
.
Appearance
He has a lean muscular build, and seems to be a similar height to Jaegyeon Na. His eyes almost appear almost closed based on the art-style in a almost slit-like manner. He has black hair with a small ponytail. He seems to have a preference for expensive clothing, wearing white dress pants secured with a luxury-brand belt, a blue dress shirt with a popped collar, and wears fancy white shoes.
Personality
Yujae is a calm and centered man who always shows a calm and relaxed appearance, but this only masks his real proud and confident personality, valuing personal gain more than principles that he calls "Romanticism" because he knows the value of Incheon and believes that he deserves a good compensation for his help. However, what he values above all is "Justification". He believes that actions only have value if they have a solid foundation, even recognizing the strength of
Gitae Kim
and the gains that he would have by allying himself with him, he does not see value in his cause since in his opinion, a bastard has no right to revive the
Gapryong Kim
era and decides to help his legitimate heir.
History
Yujae was a member of the
Dark Faction
at the time that his former leader was a member of the
0th Generation
and became its leader when he retired as the legitimate King of Incheon, however he is considered only half a king as he is in a civil war for territory against Jaegyeon Na's faction who constantly try to usurp his position.
Relationships
Jaegyeon Na
He has shown hostility towards the other King of Incheon for trying to usurp his position as the rightful king and is in a constant civil war against him.
Jake Kim
At first he showed no interest in forming an alliance with Jake, but in truth he considers him to be Gapryong's only son with justification for becoming the Shadow King and is willing to become his "Elite" and support him in the war against Kim Gitae.
Fighting Prowess
The King Of Incheon is a very skilled fighter easily countering Jake Kim's attack. It can be assumed he is on par with Jaegyeon Na as the two are both kings of Incheon currently fighting in a turf war for the region. Yujae Seon also seems to be incredibly strong, with the feat of lifting Jake Kim in the air with just one arm. It can also be presumed that he is also specializes in Aikido during his brief altercation with Jake Kim.
Yujae demonstrated
Mastery
of Speed and Technqiue
, being extremely fast and agile, easily dodging attacks from three Speed Faction ​​members while demonstrating calmness, even counterattacking a shot practically at point blank range without even showing effort.
Reverse Technique
As a former Yugang Ha, the former King of Incheon, he also mastered his
Unique Skill
that combines mastery of speed and technique to redirect the force of the opponent's attack and add his own speed to increase the damage of the counterattack.

“
His form is shitty, but his strength is the real deal! This motherfucker's attacks are terrifying!
”
— Johan about Yuseong's fighting style, Episode 421
Yuseong
is an antagonist in Lookism. He is one of
Eugene
's bodyguards, his twin brother and a VVIP of Workers.
Appearance
He has very striking similarities to
Daniel Park
. He has pale skin with freckles on his face and black hair with a fringe that covers his forehead. He almost always wears a gray cap that completely covers his eyes, a white sweater, blue jeans, white sneakers, and his VVIP black badge. Sometimes his sweater has various orange stains. He has also been shown to wear the standard gray Workers uniform on occasion, along with his white sneakers instead of dress shoes.
At school, he wears the standard school uniform along with a hoodie that covers his head.
[

]
Personality
He does not speak to anyone and generally reserves himself for fighting opponents on behalf of Eugene or following his orders. He appears to have a child-like personality.  He plays with children's toys and has been shown to possess unhygienic habits, such as putting his shoes against a car dashboard, eating very messily, sucking flavoring off his fingers, and wearing stained clothing.
[
3
]
When he is fighting opponents, he will consistently pull his cap down to hide his face. He only smiles when he is having a hard time, like polar opposite with his twin brother Eugene, who slumps when hard times happen.
Relationships
Eugene
Eugene is his twin brother. He is one of Eugene's bodyguards and is one of his best friends. Eugene considers him along with
Mandeok
as his version of Gun and Goo.
Mandeok Bang
It is unknown what their personal relationship is. However, they get along as coworkers and spend time together along with Eugene.
Synopsis
History
His past is still unknown, what is known is that at some point, in Elite Private Middle and High School, he made a "clean" in his school, the reason remains unknown, a little after the clean up, Goo Kim appears at the request of his brother, Eugene, however, it is too late for Goo to do his job since Yuseong defeated all the students in the school, after which he cries and hugs his brother while Eugene makes a monologue to Goo, still in his slumped phase.
Fighting Prowess
Yuseong is one of the strongest fighters in the workers and in the whole 4 major crews. He was able to keep up and beat Daniel during the Summit Meeting, despite Daniel using systema and UI moves. Daniel even noted that he was the strongest person in the room at the meeting, even when people like Johan and Jake were there. He doesn't have a martial art, said by Yohan, Yuseong has not learned anything about martial arts techniques, since his form is terrible, but with destructive blows
[
4
]
, therefore, Yohan concludes that he is strong by his fighting instinct.
His true strength was better demonstrated during his fight with Tom Lee. He was able to launch Tom Lee flying and was dodging most of his attacks. Tom Lee kept praising him, stating that he is very fast and despite his small body, he is able to keep up. Even though Tom Lee trained Eli and fought Johan, he regarded that Yuseong is probably the strongest among his peers.
In the Hunt for Big Deal arc we saw the heights of his power and it was immense, first off he was barely on the losing end of a fight with 'Base' Johan until he started smiling, what Eugene mentioned is that Yuseong was never seen smiling in a fight because winning a fight is too easy for Yuseong. Once Yuseong started smiling he demolished Johan without any effort, it was to the point that Johan couldn't react and see his attacks. After getting overwhelmed with zero effort by Yuseong, Johan attempted to copy (Perfect/2nd Body) UI Daniel Park (he obviously wasn't as strong or fast as him) and they were evenly matched with Yuseong outlasting the 10 seconds that Johan had and forced Johan more strain on his muscles and nervous system to release the signature "Take it Back" kick, but Yuseong blocked it and passed out for a couple seconds. Eugene claimed that Johan had won the fight but while Johan used CQC to try and take out Eugene, Yuseong got back up to take the attack and Johan gained a begrudging respect for Yuseong for being strong and protecting family. Also while Johan passed out and was out of the war Yuseong ended up going on to fight both Daniel Park and Gun Park. Yuseong has immense stamina, durability and endurance along with his strength and speed as he was able to effortlessly first destroy Jake Kim in a fight with Jake saying that he felt pathetic, then Yuseong jumped out of a window and ran down the school buildings wall, ran to Eugene's location, fought Johan Seong, took CQC and (Walmart UI) attacks, got up and fought Daniel and finally got knocked out by Gun Park.
In the Hunt For Gun arc, together with Mandeok Bang, Eugene was able to break one of Gun Park's arms at the expense of his knees, showing his strength.
Due to the descriptions given by Johan, Yuseong may also have the same trait of
Innate Strength
as all known members of the Kim Bloodline.
Trivia
He has been shown to use both his right and left hand to eat, indicating that he might be ambidextrous.
[

]
[

]
According to Eugene, he is "obsessed with strong guys".
He exhibits childlike behaviors such as wearing dirty clothes, sucking flavoring off his finger, and playing with toys.
Before his face was revealed he was commonly referred to as Cap Guy

“
I no longer fear the storm for all I need to do is not get wet.
”
— Zack Lee,
Ep. 424
Zack Lee
(이진성 Lee Jin Sung)
is a secondary character in
Lookism
. He is a student in the fashion department of
J High School
, as well as
Mira
's love interest. He's also
Gongseob Ji's
- The King of Daegu's disciple.
Appearance
Zack is tall young man with a sturdy, muscular physique. He has slicked back black hair that is cut short on the sides, though his hair had been shaved off as a result of him getting into a fight after promising not to. After this incident, he started wearing a wig
[
Citation needed
]
. After some chapters that had him in it were introduced, it's most likely he grew his hair back.
He has a very good fashion sense, paying attention to his looks when it comes to outshining his peers. He tends to wear gray-scale colored brand clothing. On several occasions, he has worn earrings. Currently, he's wearing Gongseob Ji's clothes and glasses from when he was younger.
Zack has a serious resting face with sharp glaring eyes, which in turn easily intimidates those who look at him. He only occasionally smiles, and he only smiles when he is with Mira or when he is fighting someone of great strength and beating them. He wore a wish bracelet, but it had been taken off years ago.
Personality
Prior to meeting Daniel, Zack was somehow kind at heart despite his poor manners and extremely high imprudence. He had helped both Mira and Johan in many situations regarding their pasts, such as rushing Mira to the hospital
[
2
]
and saving Johan from bullies, but this kindness was reserved for those that are close to him. As shown in the
Cult Arc
, Zack was referred to as the strongest of his middle school.
[
3
]
This greatly boosted his ego which, when in conjunction with his very short and bad temper, was the reason for most, if not all, his fights and was also the reason for his violence towards the weak.
After meeting Daniel, Zack slowly changed in ways that he isn't very attentive to, although other characters such as
Mira Kim
have. Under the circumstances of promising his love interest not to fight, he's had to put a calm face towards those mocking him, and he learned the lives of how his own victims felt. He realized his immature empowerment actions were wrong, and began to stop bother those under him,
[
4
]
even being shown to be remorseful.
[
5
]
Peers commented on this behavior, although to Zack it just felt like a bother to waste time picking on others. He matured impressively in a short life span due to his tolerance.
Although he has become somewhat diplomatic, he will try to reason with people that attempt to bother him, preferring to avoid conflict. Regarding his treatment towards others, he will tell people off for unjust actions, but tries to manage it before it resorts to violence. He controls his temper and apologizes, even if nothing is his fault. This is because he doesn't want to make Mira unhappy by having physical altercations with others, and results with others believing he's weak-willed.
Zack has had a strong affection for
Mira Kim
ever since they were children. He cares for her deeply and attempts to impress her without making a fool of himself. He gets exceedingly jealous when others flirt with her, he is always considering keeping Mira safe from others due to her bad memories of predators. Although this plays off to be a lap-dog trait, always doing everything Mira desires of him.
Despite the fact that Zack has developed into a person that truly wants to protect his friends, he is very hard on himself. He continues to blame himself for the fact that
Jiho
had attempted murder and that
Jasmine
ran away, although that's not the true underlying case. In addition to this, he had worked his body hard and trained for countless hours every day to achieve his goals of being stronger than Daniel and Johan, wanting to beat their mysterious talents with his pure effort. Zack pursued defeating Daniel,
[
6
]
however Daniel awoke in 'Ultra Instinct,' showing his true capabilities, and Zack continued to look down on himself for not being strong enough to obtain a victory.
[
7
]
After resuming training, Zack has shown himself to in complete subscription to boxing as not only a fighting style but fighting philosophy. The latter trait expressed with him taking 1-minute breaks after 3-minute intervals during his latest fight with Daniel Park (emulating the format of real boxing matches). In addition, he staunchly takes pride in his status as a boxer, calling himself a "professional" who would not engage in street fights. Despite that, he states that if he is to engage in street fights he would do so not as a boxer aiming to win but as someone aiming to kill.
However, due to a bevy of defeats at the hands of Johan, Daniel Park, Mandeok, among others, Zack has shown a keen neuroticism concerning winning fights. This has led him to adopt dirty boxing as his trump card when pressed against stronger opponents, something which he loathes due to his pride as a professional. As such, when in this state of neuroticism, Zack acts in an exaggeratedly morose and depressed manner whilst maintaining his aggression - verbally lamenting his inability to win without resorting to dirty boxing.
After not being able to get a single win against anyone in the 2nd Affiliate, even with dirty boxing, he was at a loss. He lamented about how everyone else around him was getting stronger and he seemed incapable of being so, frustrated to the point he didn't have any tears to cry about it anymore. His pity party was cut short when Cho Ma and Gong Ji found him sulking. After criticizing him for fighting, they told him to go to Daegu if he wanted to go continue ruining his life by getting stronger. There he found Gongseob Ji, a 1st Generation King who once ruled over Daegu. While hesitating at first to train him, Zack managed to touch Gongseob's heartstrings and began to learn iron boxing. While physically training him was part of it, the most important thing Gongseob trained Zack was mentally. In a month, Zack became a different person, No longer was he a guy quick to anger or someone filled with neuroticism, going down the path of self-loathing would leave him as a bird trapped in a cage unable to fly. He would only become stronger once he took pride in himself and everything he learned, and Zack Lee achieved it with flying colors.
He became someone who believes in himself and his abilities, now trying to block out any form of negative thoughts not cloud his judgment, and has even picked up the habit of crying out to the Buddha as a means of calming himself. After everything he's been through, Zack Lee has finally become a bird able to fly, now confident with the person he has became and no longer burdened with his shortcomings.
Zack in the current chapters apparently seems more relaxed in terms of humor, seen when he was sarcastic with
Johan Seong
, Calling him a crybaby after he was saddened by what happened to him by his mother. This shows that Zack seems to have more of a sense of humor, since in previous chapters, He always had a serious face, but now it's different, with him making expressions and mocking in the same way as his master,
Gongseob Ji
History
Zack comes from a rich family,referring to $500 as pocket change.
[
8
]
During the early parts of the story he was seen spending his money on top-notch clothing to impress Mira.
[
9
]
Zack has known and had a crush on
Mira
since childhood. He used to accompany her on various extracurricular activities, not out of his own interest but rather to spend more time with her. Mira was the one who introduced Zack to the world of boxing being one of the activities she was attending at the time.
At some point, he befriended Johan, who was going to the same church he did when they were young. Zack wasn't aware of Johan's fighting potential until he saw him copying one of his boxing moves.
[
10
]
Zack knew Johan had feelings for Mira, and it was part of the wedge that drove the two of them apart.
Having once enjoyed the bullying of the weak, Zack has since changed due to the influence of Mira, whom he is in love with, and is now on good terms with both sides of Daniel Park.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Iron Boxing
Zack is a very capable fighter who can hold his own against most of his peers in school and was placed in the same caliber as Vasco and Daniel. Unlike
Vasco
or Daniel, Zack had neglected his training for quite some time as he was confident that his fighting ability was enough to hold his own against any opponent at the start of the series. His pride in his abilities has since been humbled by the staggering number of formidable fighters around him who possess even more talent than him. Once realizing he's no longer able to fully protect Mira, he has decided to resume training with a mindset that his hard work would surpass his enemy's and friend's talents.
[
11
]
Zack is a proficient out-boxer, having trained since childhood and is considered a formidable opponent by his peers due to his outstanding talent earning him achievements in numerous competitions. His type of fighting style is a hit and run outboxer.
[
12
]
Zack's out-boxing style is typical, relying heavily on speed to deliver quick combinations utilizing straight punches with little in the way of body blows. This fighting style effectively placing Zack in a position to attack and denying his opponents counterattack. When pressed, Zack will normally use his footwork and head movement to evade.
When in a situation in which blocking is absolutely necessary, Zack has demonstrated an impressive understanding and application of the Philly Shell, a style popularized by Floyd Mayweather Jr. This style is characterized by the usage of the shoulder roll, resulting in opponent's punches being deflected and diffused off of the user's round shoulder.
Only a handful of fighters can actually keep up with Zack and dodge his punches such as Daniel Park and Johan. As such, Zack's speed has been used as a benchmark for other fighters. If the said opponent is on par with or surpasses Zack's speed, they are considered threats not to be taken lightly which is a further testament to the danger Zack's speed possesses.
However, as a result of Zack's reliance on his speed, fighters that equal or surpass found themselves in a position much more favorable to victory.
However, Zack is not set in his style, having created counters to techniques used against him such as being able to respond to Daniel's utilization of a body blow in Zack's later fight with Logan Lee. Beyond skill, Zack has also demonstrated vast improvements to himself after resuming training, giving up his pride in exchange for grit and determination. On a mental level, this has given Zack greater endurance and resolve to see his strategies through such as enduring Daniel Park's attacks to formulate his own counterattacks. On a physical level, this has resulted in Zack becoming immensely more powerful, stunning Johan and Daniel in a past fight with narration stating that he has the style and tendencies of an out-boxer but the power of a in-fighter.
However, despite Zack's continual efforts to become stronger now, he held an inclination to not train in other styles, sticking only to boxing. Even when pressed to train in a mixed martial arts setting, he refused, and continued with boxing, despite his own coach's admission that Zack has essentially mastered all of boxing's techniques with any further advancement coming in the form of physical training. However, as of Chapter 352, Zack has begun to "discard his pride" and now utilizes dirty boxing, having used head-butts and pivot blows (spinning backfists). This could lead into a transition to other forms of martial arts. Recently, he enjoyed using chains as a weapon.
He loses confidence due to repeated defeats, falls into a state of self-loathing and his body starts "burning up." This is called heat mode. It occurs when feeling self-hatred for not being able to achieve something. The body becomes really hot to the point where your heart is about to burst, causing you to have an awakening in strength.
Later on, he is trains under Gongseop Ji, a king from the first generation whose fighting style consists of being able deal with and dish out heavy damage. This is shown by him being able to not only take hits, but also deal overwhelming damage to Mandeok Bang, who had previously been able to one-shot Zack. Zack also further improved his outboxer style, with intense training resulting with his movements being far quicker than before.
After his training is finished he teams up with Daniel and Vasco to fight against the Workers. Eventually, after the battle is finished Zack joins the
Allied
crew. During the 1 st affiliate Arc Zack fought Gen 0 fighter Gwang Yu on equal footing and defeated him ,such that he recognized Zack to be the true Iron Boxer ,he also fought a drugged Johan Seong  on equal footing defeating him, tanking every hit and countering with equal force, he also developed the Gongseob Ji Counter during this fight. During Hunt for Gun Park arc he with other memembers stalled the Yamazaki leader for a long time gaining his praise.

J High School
Daniel Park
Old Body
Despite being in a very strange and brutal situation, Daniel managed to convince Zack, without Daniel knowing, to stop bullying others and defend the weak. In subsequent episodes, it is shown that they usually get along well with each other.
New Body
When Daniel is first in his body, Zack is shown to resent Daniel for "flirting" with Mira despite doing nothing. In Daniel's old body, Zack takes out his anger on his for having the same name when Daniel is working. In Daniel's new body, he chooses to ignore Zack's remarks about him until the mention of his mother. Zack is confused at first, but is then angered when he notices Mira staring at Daniel, leading to their fight to which Daniel wins.
The two have a resentful relationship until when Daniel is asked to hangout and is met with Zack, who Daniel later remarks that he thought Zack and Mira were dating due to their close relationship, deeming them a couple. Zack, drunk, is joyed by Daniel's remark and deems him a good person.
The two have a somewhat playful rivalry between them, mostly one-sided by Zack. Zack envies Daniel for his talent, yet never l blames him for it and instead chooses to work harder while claiming himself talented as well.
Later on in the Webtoon, the two are good friends. Going on trips together, fighting and even teaming together in fights. Even when Daniel suddenly goes missing, Zack confronts Daniel about his absence and tells him how worried he was for Daniel. The two have a great friendship as of now.

Exposition
Chapter 2
The protagonist, Daniel, first meets Jin Sung on the streets after Daniel, in his original body, had just gotten a haircut. Daniel thought his haircut had made him very handsome, but nobody else seemed to think so. When Daniel finds Mijin looking at him, he thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her. Jin Sung sees Daniel smile at Mijin and thinks he's propositioning her. He confronts Daniel, and may have gotten into a fight if Mijin had not steered him away, telling him not to act aggressively in public. While walking away, Mijin smiles apologetically at Daniel for Jin Sung's behaviour. However, Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mijin and Jin Sung out for coffee. Unable to keep his anger under control, Jin Sung punches Daniel in the face while bystanders took pictures and uploaded them online.
Chapter 4
The first day of school, Daniel realizes that his seat is right next to Jin Sung's. When Ha Neul begins flirting with Daniel, Jin Sung tells her to stop flirting because it was annoying.
When Jin Sung sees Mijin staring at Daniel, he begins to hate Daniel for being handsome because he thinks that Mijin likes Daniel.
Chapter 5
When Jin Sung goes to the convenience store where Daniel works at night, he is upset because he thinks Mijin is attracted to Daniel in his new body. He tries to extort free alcohol and cigarettes from Daniel despite the fact that he and his friends were all underage.
It was also revealed that Chapter 2 was Jin Sung's date with Mijin. Moreover, Jin Sung had asked Mijin out, but she had refused.
Jin Sung was so upset by all this that he beats Daniel up. In order to ensure that Daniel doesn't say anything, they take pictures of him with his pants down.
The next day, Daniel in his new body walk in on Jin Sung, his friends from last night, and Ha Neul talking about the way Jin Sung had beat him up the night before. Jin Sung's friend was showing off the picture he had taken of Daniel with his pants down. Ha Neul waves at Daniel, telling him that Jin Sung's friend had something fun to show them. Daniel gets mad because they were making fun of him.
Chapter 6
When Jin Sung's friends show off the picture of Daniel and compliment Jin Sung's speed, Jin Sung tells them that he isn't proud of hitting Daniel even though he actually wants them to speak up louder so Mijin would hear. He thinks that Mijin would think he is cool for being very strong. Instead, Mijin says that he hates the way Jin Sung fights all the time. She explains that in Chapter 2 Jin Sung had invited her to the movies only to get into a fight (with Daniel). The girl chatting with Mijin tells her that Jin Sung used to be a rising boxer in middle school.
Jin Sung brags about his fighting expertise by explaining that he shouldn't have hit Daniel with a straight punch but instead with a jab.
He and his friends then laugh that Daniel's mother must also be "a pig," and Mijin thinks they are disgusting.
One of Jin Sung's friends then says that he will take both Daniel in his original body and his mother. He goes on to say that Daniel's mother would not have been happy when she gave birth to him and that, if he were her, he would have had an abortion.
Daniel realizes that his mother was being insulted because of him and gets up to tell Jin Sung and his friends that they have gone too far. With this, Jae Yeol, friends of Jin Sung, Mijin and Ha Neul seem surprised, while Jin Sung is outraged because Daniel made a fool in front of Mijin.
Jin Sung then takes a fight with Daniel, raising his own table and telling Daniel to get up.
Autumn Boot Camp Arc
Daniel sits next to Jin Sung on the bus to the camp.
When in the camp, after the talent show, Jin Sung and Daniel are invited by Hyun Do to drink with him and several girls from the Department of Beauty. Jin Sung makes an excuse to leave, and Daniel follows. Jin Sung takes Daniel to Mijin's room where they drink with Mijin, Ha Neul, Ji Ho and another girl. Because they all fainted after being drunk, except for Mira, who did not drink a drop, they were not caught by the camp counselors.
Later, when Mijin was nowhere to be found, Jin Sung ran to find her, alerting Daniel that something was wrong. Jin Sung finds Mijin in a shed, crying and bleeding, trying to keep
Zeus
, the camp instructor who was trying to untie her pants, out of it. Infuriated, Jin Sung attacks him, only for Zeus to seize him. Jin Sung realizes belatedly that Zeus knows Muay Thai, and Zeus is able to break his ribs and both arms. Zeus thinks he has won, but Won Bin suddenly grabs Zeus's leg. Won Bin, unable to stand, crawled to stop Zeus. Jin Sung soca Zeus in the face, despite his broken arms. When Daniel encounters Jin Sung and Mijin, they find Jin Sung out of his mind, repeatedly punching Zeus in the face.
As Zeus is being taken away by the police, viewers comment that he looks too handsome to be a sex offender and speculates on this to be a false accusation. Meanwhile, they laugh at the fact that Won Bin looks more like the perpetrator than the hero. Jin Sung, sitting in the back of an ambulance, confronts the onlookers, telling them to care about their mouths. He bows to Wo Bin, thanking him for protecting him and Mijin. When Mijin asks if Jin Sung is well, Jin Sung energetically replies that he is totally fine and tells her to stay with the police. As soon as Mijin leaves, he collapses. Jin Sung was so injured that it took two months to recover, and Mijin was taken to take apples in the hospital bed and thanked him for saving her.
Eun Tae says he came because he wanted to make people stop saying he's dumb. Jin Sung, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Eun Tae's superstitious ideas, making fun of Eun Tae, saying that ghosts do not really exist. Bum Jae tells him that if he is not afraid, he should sign his name on the glass frame around the picture.
When Jin Sung arrives at the warehouse, he realizes that the lights can not be lit. He then rushes to a glass panel, only to see the portrait of the ghost woman staring maliciously at him, bloodshot eyes wide open. Jin Sung hastily signs his name on glass and skedaddles. As he runs back into the classroom, he cries like a baby, just in case.
In the classroom, Bum Jae is incredulous that Jin Sung signed his name on the portrait. He wants to take an immediate look at Eun Tae, but Eun Tae, scared, tells him to go tomorrow.
The next morning, the school is agitated with the news that Jin Sung has signed his name on the portrait, and they all head to the storage room to see if it's true.
When they get there, they realize that Jin Sung's signature is not in the glass frame outside the picture, but in the windowpane. Jin Sung realizes that the lady's eyes of the picture are closed and that he actually saw the ghost the night before. He faints and wet his pants.
In the end, he explains that if he had hallucinated due to fear or actually seen a ghost, the important thing was that Mijin saw him wet his pants.
Jay's Wallet
When Jae Yeol rushes to the seat of Daniel to teach him a problem, Jin Sung can be seen sleeping next to Daniel in the classroom.
Troubled Transfer
He is seen by
Jay-gal Song
with Mira in the lunchroom. Jay-gal pretends to accidentally bump into him, making food from his lunch tray hit Logan Lee. When Zack apologizes and brushes the food off, Logan glares at him. Zack responds by apologizing submissively, much to the anger of Jay-gal. Zack and Mira leave without getting into a fight.
They take a seat and Mira prays, with Zack pretending to pray to please her. However, in the middle of Mira's prayer, Logan dumps food on Mira's head on purpose.

Jay-gal giddily thinks that Zack is going to get angry at Logan, but Zack instead takes a napkin and wipes the food off Mira, asking if she's okay. He asks a girl to take Mira to wash off in the bathroom. Logan mistakenly thinks that Zack is just an idiot. When Mira leaves, Zack suddenly punches Logan in the face, catching him off guard.
Jay-gal thinks that Logan is going to beat Zack, but Zack punches Logan and he is surprised by Zack's speed. Logan wipes the blood off his nose and Zack says he is surprised by Logan's defense. Zack says he can deal with someone bothering him, but not Mira.
Zack goes in to kick him when Logan counters with a "body blow" which Zack blocks with his arms. In his head, he worries that his arms are broken again. Logan is shocked that his punch was blocked, but quickly recovers. He tackles Zack into the floor and he screams, which makes Vasco overhear the fight.

Logan pours food onto him. Zack tries to get up, but he can't because he hadn't worked out in a while. He said that he wouldn't regret it, yet he did. He is unable to get off the ground. A wet-haired Mira steps between him and Logan. Logan pulls her hair, which makes Zack extremely angry and he punches Logan in the nose. He tells Mira to dry her hair or else she'd get a cold and Mira is touched by his concern.
Vasco grabs him Logan by the shoulder to try and stop the fight, but Zack tells him not to interfere. At that moment, Jin Vin steps through the door and wants to rechallenge Logan. The three want to challenge Logan to fight.

Cult Arc
Young Johan, Mira, and Zack are in church and they pray to God. Zack prays that he would get together with Mira. Someone holds out a basket for an offering and Zack asks if giving more money would mean better things, and Johan mysteriously tells him not necessarily. Zack then shoves the money back in his pocket, saying that he was saving the money for the arcade anyways.
The young trio and in a neighborhood getting haircuts, and Zack says that the neighborhood was crappy. Zack aggressively asks Yohan's mom if she was doing his hair correctly, and Mira angrily scolds him.
The three get wish bracelets, and Zack wishes to marry Mira in the future.
At 15 years old, Zack saves Johan from a group of bullies, but Johan runs away and refuses to acknowledge that he knows Zack. Mira sees them, but doesn't talk to Zack until after Johan runs away.

“
Daniel? Hi, I’m Zoe
”
Zoe Park
(
박하늘 Park Ha Neul
) is a secondary character in
Lookism
. She is a student within the fashion department of
J High School
.
Appearance
Though it has never been explicitly said throughout the Manhwa, Zoe is considered to be a very beautiful young lady. She is rather tall, clocking in at 5'8, taller than most characters who suffered the Lookism such as Daniel. She has a curvy figure, with her biggest assist being her noticeable bust. She has shoulder-length black hair curls up on her shoulders while sporting bangs, in the anime it's just kept as straight black hair, clear fair skin, and brown eyes as seen in the anime.
She is mainly shown wearing the standard J high female uniform without the tan-colored vest. Outside of school, she is seen wearing a variety of fashionable outfits, they are never consistent and are usually one-off appearances, but her most notable non-school outfit is the one she wears while visiting Little Daniel at his part-time job at the start of the series. Consisting of a black shirt covered with a gray zip-up sweater, blue sweat shorts, and white socks with pink-colored shoes, it's the design they use for the mobile game.
Personality
She initially came off as a shallow person. At school she was known to be a flirt, trying to get with guys based on their looks alone. She immediately attempted to flirt with Big
Daniel Park
and fell in love with him just because of his perfect looks. The same logic can be applied in reverse, she judges people due to their unconventional appearances rather than looking at the content of their character.
However, after being saved from a stalker by Daniel in his original body, even after how she treated him, She begins to have a crush on Daniel's original body, this time not because of his appearance but for the content of his character. It was shown that she was genuinely a good person, as seen how protective of those close to her, as seen by the struggles she went through at the hands of Logan Lee to protect small Daniel, but had her morals in the wrong places. After this in-counter with Little Daniel, she continuously has shown to be kind to everyone, including strangers, even when it isn't beneficial to her, trying to show others the kindness Daniel showed her that day. This is shown when she puts a band-aid on
Logan Lee
when she gives
Stalker Girl
a hot pack.
Quotes
Trivia
Zoe's japanese name name
Mirei

ka
) and "river, stream" (川) (
kawa
/
gawa
).
Zoe is a fan of
BTS
, as shown in Chapter 39 when she is excited that they had replied to one of her comments.
Zoe's dream is to gain 10 million subscribers online. She has lessened her activity online after she was stalked, but is still determined to reach her goal even after the incident.
Zoe has the highest score in maths for the fashion department.
After the stalker incident Zoe is often shown internally struggling with who she likes most (Big Daniel and Small Daniel).

Plot
Chapter 4
Zoe first meets Daniel on the first day of school, and immediately begins flirting with him. Daniel blushes because it was the first time a girl had ever flirted with him.
When Daniel fell asleep in class and woke up in his original body, he tried to fall asleep in his original body. When he wasn't able to wake up, he started swearing. Zoe approaches his new body to try to wake him up. When Daniel wakes up in his new body, he was still swearing, which shocked Zoe. However, she only liked him even more afterwards.
Chapter 5
Zoe is shown talking with Zack and his friends. Zack had beat up Daniel in his original body the night before and had taken a picture of Daniel with his pants down to ensure that he didn't say anything. Zack's friends were showing off the picture when Daniel walks in. Zoe calls to Daniel, telling him that Zack's friend had something fun to show him. Daniel gets mad because they were making fun of him.
Chapter 6
When Zack's friend offers to show Zoe the picture of Daniel, Zoe refuses reluctantly because even though she wants to see, she doesn't want Daniel to think badly of her.
Later, when two girls come up to Daniel to flirt and ask if he has a girlfriend, Zoe immediately barges in and asks if he would like to hang out with her instead.
When Zack's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jay, Zack's friends, Mira, and Zoe look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.
Breakaway
Festival
Paprika TV
In the Paprika TV arc, Zoe was going to buy a purse when
Yui
told her that it wasn't pretty and didn't suit her. Zoe reluctantly decides not to buy it, and was shocked when she saw Yui the next day with the same purse. She soon realizes that Yui is interested in Daniel, and thinks that they would make a good couple because she believes they both are rich. Later, she realizes that Yui was earning money off of Paprika TV, a live-broadcasting platform where watchers can gift broadcasters with "balloons" that can be, then, exchanged for money. Zoe decides to start broadcasting as well. She immediately rises to the top of the charts after a week. Meanwhile, a user named Gangnam Landlord gifts her with a lot of balloons. It is shown that he used to follow Yui, creeping her out. Zoe doesn't realize anything wrong, but Gangnam Landlord is actually a stalker who used his savings on Zoe and feels entitled to love in return. When he runs out of money and Zoe stops paying attention to him, he feels betrayed and buys a knife at the convenience store where Daniel works along with his customary bottle of whiskey. Daniel, noticing something is wrong, follows him, informs the police and Vasco of what's going on, and protects Zoe from the stalker. The stalker was apprehended by the police, and Zoe fell in love with Daniel in his original body.
Mid Terms
When Daniel was studying in his original body in the convenience store, Zoe walks in on her cellphone watching a BTS broadcast. Daniel, worried for her safety after the Paprika TV arc, tells her she should leave. Zoe, realizing that he is studying, offers to tutor him, explaining that she is top of the class in math.
Autumn Boot Camp
Zoe was drinking with Daniel, Jiho, Zack, Mira, and another girl. Because they all passed out afterwards drunk, except for Mira who didn't drink a drop, they weren't caught by the camp counselors.

Daniel Park
Zoe realizing Daniels height growth
Zoe first met Daniel in his new body. Being the first person to ever flirt with Daniel, she initially came off as a shallow person, only pressurizing him for his looks, a practice she would always do every time she sees a good-looking guy. The same logic applied to his original body, she judged and didn't respect him due to his unconventional appearance. However, after being saved from a stalker by Daniel in his original body, even after how she treated him, she realizes that she shouldn't just like someone for their looks. She begins to have a crush on Daniel's original body, this time not because of his appearance but for the content of his character. She would try to repay the kindness he showed him, whether that be keeping him company convenience store late at night or checking up on him by asking Big Daniel how Little Daniel was doing or just asking him things about him to know more about him. Her nickname for his old body is "Piggy", once a way to insult him, became a name she would use rather affectionately towards him. While Daniel was taken aback by this change of attitude, he would soon warm up to her and the two would become close friends, something he would hold dearly. He was so comfortable with her that she was the only person he willingly shared his past of being bullied and an outcast, something he claimed he couldn't be honest with his friends due to the fear of losing them if they found out and when Logan came back into his life, Daniel was willing to leave everything behind if it meant that Logan could no longer take advantage of him to get closer to her.
Daniel waring Zoe of accepting free Plastic Surgery from the First Affiliate
Zoe cried that day, she realized that almost everyone in his life (including her) treated him horribly because of his appearance, and even if it was in a misguided effort to do so, he would do anything to protect her. Zoe didn't want Daniel to suffer anymore, and to protect him, she confronted Logan. Logan took advantage of this desperation and forced her into a contract, they would go on six dates to try and make her fall in love with him and if didn't work, he would leave both of them alone. However, he didn't make it easy, regularly abusing her physically and emotionally with threats of killing Daniel if she did not comply with his wishes. Zoe felt trapped in a box, a box she concluded that Daniel was in after all his years of bullying, but it didn't matter to her. No matter how many times she was talked bad about, no more how many times she was hit, no matter how many times she cried, it will all be worth it if it meant that Daniel could just sit back and not suffer anymore. So when she found Daniel at her doorstep with the words "You're finally looking at me." with nothing but a smile on his face after beating Logan. She hugged him, and to see that the struggles she went through to protect Daniel paid off, she cried tears of relief and happiness.
Despite it still being unconfirmed whether or not Daniel shares the same feelings she does, it's undeniable the two of them are the closest of friends. Whether it be Daniel literary storming the First Affiliate to save Zoe from a botched plastic surgery to Zoe putting her body and feelings on the line to protect Daniel from his bullies the smaller thing like Daniel denouncing the rumors of Zoe being considered 'easy' to get with to Zoe supporting and celebrating Daniels weight loss. Both have mutual respect and deeply care for each other well being.
Logan Lee
Zoe is Logan's ex-girlfriend. She dated him out of fear that he would hurt Daniel if she refused, but was spared when Daniel fought Logan for her freedom. She hates Logan due to his terrible personality. Despite this Logan still likes her and carries a band-aid that she gave him long ago.
