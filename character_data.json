        "synopsis": "The\npre-generation\nfirst appeared in chapter 359 when DG explains to Daniel about the history of the fists. In this generation, there were no leaders but bosses, and the teams were called fists. The\npre-generation\nwas characterized as a generation of people united around Gapryong Kim.\nGallery\nEp. 359\n- Gen 0\nEp. 359\n- Gen 0 (2)\nEp. 359\n- Gapryong running for elections\nTrivia\nDuring the Pre-Generation, crews were called \"Fists\" and crew heads were called \"Bosses\"\n[\n2\n]\nAbout the\n\"Gapryong Kim's fist gang\"\nit is said in chapter 411 that \"Each member had a different goal, but they united under the banner of the fist gang to fight against a\n\"great power\".\nIt is not known what things were like before the\npre-generation\n, it is most likely that the\n\"Great Power\"\nhad a lot of presence in those times. Most likely, there was no one who could stand up to him. Perhaps the gangs of those times were not called \"Fists\" and their leaders would not be called \"Bosses\" (although the latter can be questioned for obvious reasons).\nIt was recently revealed in chapter 502 that the time of Generation 0 was a battle of countries, Korea against Japan, the former being known as Japan's\n\"great power\"\nand Korea's greatest enemy, the leader of the Yamazaki Clan, as well as the father of Gun Park,\nShingen Yamazaki\n.\n[\n3\n]\nGapryong's line about Gun Park's father having \"chosen his death\" implies something akin to that of a tragedy for Shingen may have happened during their great fight. This is also faintly supported by Shingen's line about \"I'm not going to miss the next time\" and \"It's all in the past now\".\n\u2191\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/ep-359-james-lee-end/viewer?title_no=1049&episode_no=359\n\u2191\nEpisode 359\n\u2191\nGun Park's Father\nIn Generation 0, it is known from\nJichang\nthat there was a feud between\nJinyoung Park\nand\nElite/Charles Choi\n. The reason why they hated each other is unknown at the moment.\nThe identity of the\nGeneration 0\nBosses is unknown, we only know one Boss and that is\nGapryong Kim\n, it is known that he was the strongest of them as he was the Legend of his Generation.\nTheories:\nAs to whether or not there was a Boss in Seoul, there is no doubt that in the\nFirst Generation\nthere was no Boss in Seoul. The reason is simple and it is because the place was dominated by\nJichang\n(the former King of Seoul) and later by the eldest son of Gapryong Kim (the current King of Seoul). It is unlikely that Bosses and Kings shared their territories.\nJames Lee\nstates that the\npre-generation\nwas a generation of people united around Gapryong Kim. He also confirms to us that undoubtedly, all the \"Fists\" and \"Bosses\" were comrades of\nGapryong Kim\n. All of them must have had the same goal of facing a\n\"very great power\".\nPerhaps, the pre-generation began with various gangs and leaders.  But Gapryong's gang would be known as \"Fist\" and he would be the Boss.  He would then begin to confront and defeat the disunited gangs, it could be said that he would unify the Korean gangs.  Along the way, he would earn several comrades by defeating rival gangs.  Possibly Jinyoung Park, Tom Lee and Elite used to be leaders of those gangs OR they were already Fists of Gapryong Kim from the start.  In this way, Gapryong Kim would unite most of the Korean gangs that were disunited.\nThere are reasons why a Boss will stop dominating a place. First, this Bosses retired like\nGapryong Kim\nwould to do something else, which would be normal considering how much time has passed. Second, the Bosses that participated in the\nFirst Generation\nstopped dominating their corresponding zone because they would be defeated and replaced by some King. This last option should be the least likely, but it would not be impossible considering factors such as age. In addition to that it is not known what level those Bosses are at and there is a possibility that they are at the level of the Kings or a little higher, both in the pre-generation and in the first generation (where they would be weaker due to age).\n\"Very Great Power\" Theories\n1- That\n\"very great power\"\ncould be the Yakuza itself, the reasons to believe that it was the yakuza is because in real life there was a \"gangster\" named Kim Du-Han, he grew up as a beggar due to the death of his parents and he became involved with a local gang called the Jumok (\"fist\"). Kim Du-Han faced the yakuza, becoming a symbol of the resistance of the Koreans against the Japanese. Kim Du-Han was a major figure in the movement against colonial rule and later became a politician. If it came to be true, that would mean that the reason Gun sided with Charles Choi would be to kill Gapryong Kim (who would be the Kim Du-Han of this universe) for having been an enemy of the Yakuza in his time.\nThe error of this last theory would be to see how in lookism Koreans hate Gapryong Kim for his past as a gang member, being the reason why he failed to be a politician unlike Kim Du-Han.\nReferences"

        "name": "The",
        "history": "The\n1st Generation\nwas first revealed by DG episode 359 when DG explained to Daniel the\nHistory of Fists\n.\n[\n1\n]\nDuring this generation, Gapryong's followers began to fight each other for greed and power, and that struggle for power ended up with them recruiting high school students who were followers of the Pre-Generation. \"The Fist\" would rule over these groups of students known as \"circles\" and within those students, individuals would rise above them and become leaders known as \"Kings\". They tended to occupy larger areas such as a city and provinces in the countryside in order to run illegal businesses to make money.\nThere is known to be a \"ranking\" of Kings, where those of a higher ranking are from larger, more significant regions in Korea.\nThe generation was full of violence and had no romance. \"Kings\" and \"Circles\" would always be in a constant struggle fighting over territory until the strongest member of this generation,\nJames Lee\nwould appear. He ended the circles by defeating the kings, mutilating several of the kings in the process. It's unknown how many Kings he did this to, as kings like Jichang did not lose a body part, there are only two confirmed victims. He took\nTaesoo Ma\n's right eye and contributed to the loss of\nGongseob Ji\n's right leg.\n[\n2\n]\nThe fate of the fists that participated in the first generation is unknown but after this most people of the 1st Generation were scarred by him. Most of them would stay put in their own territory passing on the story of the Legend that ended the 1st Generation.\nMost Kings would do the same, continuing their businesses in their own territories, other kings like, Gongseob Ji, would renounce their position and distance themselves from his past. After the flames of war died out, James Lee would become one of the ten genius and helped\nCharles Choi\nbuild a new era of the crews that would later become the\n2nd Generation\n. He would also be manipulated by Charles Choi which ended in him killing\nGapryong Kim\nbefore disappearing without a trace.\n[\n1\n]\nMost of the 1st Generation would take in pupils from the 2nd Generation in order to pass on their training methods, they are still searching for James Lee to pay him back for what he did.\n[\n1\n]\nSynthesis\nGeneration 0.5:\nThis \"generation\" would exist after\npre-generation/generation 0\nended and\nGapryong Kim\nhanded over most of the organization to his followers (apparently they were pre-generation as well). And as\nJames Lee\nsays, those followers were a problem. Since these would start wars out of greed and thus the first generation would emerge. It is unknown what this \"generation\" would be like, but it is possible that the teams continued to be called Fists and their leaders would be Bosses.\nGeneration 1:\nIn this generation, Gapryong Kim's followers would recruit students for their power struggles. In this way, the pregeneration and those students would fight those wars together. The students associated with the pregeneration were called Circles, the leaders of these Circles were known as Kings. Possibly the leaders of the Fists (pre-generation/followers of Gapryong Kim) who participated in the First Generation were still called Chiefs.  Some time later, several Kings would go to Cheonliang to help Seongji Yuk. A year later, James Lee would wipe out the first generation by defeating the kings, as well as taking a part of their body (either an eye or a leg). Meanwhile, Charles Choi would already have all 10 of his geniuses at his disposal.\nShortly after, the second generation would begin with the meeting of Charles and some of his geniuses.\nConclusion:\nIt is not known what the fate of the fists was with the appearance of James Lee, because it is only mentioned how he defeated the circles to eliminate the links between the pre-generation and the first generation. You can only make theories and assumptions about what was the fate of the fists that participated in this generation\nEnd of First Generation\nTheories\n1- The simplest answer (the most boring and disappointing) is that the Fists chickened out when they saw how the Circles were defeated and crushed by James Lee.\n2- James Lee also took care of the Fists, but it was simply not mentioned explicitly because it perhaps seemed unnecessary to say it at the time. I consider it one of the most probable theories or the most probable.\n3- The current king of Seoul would defeat the Fists, in my opinion it is less likely than the two previous theories.  I think it might be possible because he is very strong.\n4- Daniel's second corps defeated the Fists. I consider it even less likely than the above theory (and by far) due to the fact that in those days he should only be a tween or teenager, plus no one recognized him.\nHypothesis\n1- One of the three unrevealed geniuses of Charles Choi was the one who defeated the Fists and their Bosses (to put Charles Choi's plan into action and then start the next generation).\n2- One of the followers of Gapryong Kim defeated the Fists and their Chiefs, the reason would be the indignation or regret for what the other followers of Gapryong Kim caused.\n3- The person who would defeat the Fists would be a member of the \"great power\". I think at some point they will show us what they are or were capable of doing.\n4- A character that we do not know at all was the one who crushed the Fists. I consider it less likely than the previous hypotheses, but who knows.\nMembers\nKitae Kim - King of Seoul\nJames Lee - One Man Circle\nSeongji Yuk - Cheongliang King\nJinrang - Busan King\nJichang Kwak - Chungcheong King, Former King of Seoul\nTaesoo Ma - Ansan King\nGongseob Ji - Daegu King\nSeokdu Wang - Suwon King\nJaegyeon Na - Incheon King\nYujae Seon - Incheon King\nDoksu Heo - Pyeongtaek King\nJinyong Go - Seongnam King\nMugeon Jang - Samcheok King\nSeungwoo Han - Yongin King\nSiheon Choi - Paju King\nMuseok Jang - Pohang King\nUnnamed Original King of Chungcheong\nSanghui-han\nand\nYeong Cheol Kim\n- Circle Catchers\nUnknown members of the\npre-generation\nDayoung Oh\n- Former King of Busan\nKing of Seoul\nKitae Kim\nOne Man Circle\nJames Lee\nKings\nJichang Kwak \u271f\nJinrang\nJaegyeon Na\nYujae Seon\nSeongji Yuk\u271f\nGongseob Ji\nTaesoo Ma\nSeokdu Wang\nDoksu Heo\nJinyong Go\n???\n???\nDayoung Oh \u271f\nMugeon Jang\nSeungwoo Han\nS\u0131heon Choi\nMuseok Jang\n???\n???\n???\n???\n???\nCircles\nBusan Circle\nSang Baek \u271f\nHwang Jungseok\nHyun Baekjin\nJaegwang Do \u271f\nHashik Song \u271f\nIncheon Circle (\nDark Faction\n)\nMugak Wang\nJaun Ryu\nCheonmu Ha\nWoongi Yeom\nJamal Rahid\nCheon Bang\nTao Ju\nYeonryong Sa\nIncheon Circle (\nSpeed Faction\n)\nRoy Kwon\nSung Jegal\nYeowool Ha\nBoknam Lee\nSebastian Kang\nSangcheok Circle\nHangi Yu\nSeonggu Bae\nYongin Circle\n???\n???\nPaju Circle\n???\n???\nPohang Circle\n???\n???\nMembers\nSanghui Han\nYeongcheol Kim\nAbout the Provinces/Cities\nAnsan\nAnsan is an industrial city in Korea, located close to Seoul and south of Incheon, forming part of Gyeonggi Province. Now, within the series, Ansan has as King\nTaesoo Ma\n, whose unique fighting style is the use of only one fist (a style that was named Hard Fist).\nDuring the First Generation, it is unknown what the \"Ansan Circle\" was like, or how Taesoo Ma ran it (or if he even ran it).\nCurrently\n, Ansan's most notable crew is\nAnsan Public\n, which owns a karaoke bar.\nAfter certain events, Ansan Public was subjugated by the\nWorkers' 5th Affiliate\n, while still managed by\nEli Jang\n. After the departure of\nEli Jang\nand\nWarren Chae\nfrom Workers, Ansan's current status remains unknown.\nBusan\nBusan was under the rule by Dalyoung Oh, the head of Busan Gang and a former disciple of Gapryong Kim. He ruled with an iron fist, making the city bend towards his will, using Gapryong's name to get whatever he wanted.\nThis was until Lang Jin returned and rebelled against him, killing Dalyoung after he witnessed how Dalyoung mistreated his subordinates. This would lead to Lang Jin usurping the throne. Busan would then be reorganised under the Lang Jin Gang while their boss was serving time in prison.\nCheonliang\nSeongji Yuk\ndid not participate in any financial activities in the past. He did not have a legitimate crew to rule over the region as majority of the region had been brainwashed. He lived on a mountain with the Cheonliang Fam to evade the\nShaman's\nfalse god brainwashing.\nSoon after the death of Seongji Yuk and kidnapping of\nCheon Taejin\n, Cheonliang would be developed into a luxury resort with beaches, under the\nHNH conglomerate.\nChungcheong\nTBA\nDaegu\nTBA\nIncheon\nKnown as the \"land of war\" or \"land of internal conflict\", Incheon is divided and under rule by two kings, since the 0th Generation, with\nJaegyeon Na\nand\nYujae Seon\nagainst each other. From flashbacks during the Busan arc and with context between James Lee's and Jaegyeon's conversation, James has some leverage over Jaegyeon. Which allows James some measure of control over the actions of Jaegyeon, as seen in the Busan arc where he betrayed Allied.\nPyeongtaek\nTBA\nSeoul\nSeoul was originally run by\nJichang Kwak\n, but later ceded to Kitae Kim after Jichang was taken down. It is known that Kitae immediately left for Mexico after claiming the seat of King of Seoul, leaving Seoul to be divided into the 4 Major Crews later in the Second Generation.\nSeongnam\nTBA\nSuwon\nSuwon engaged in a thug for hire business called the Suwon Staffing Agency run by Seokdu Wang. This business would be then taken over by the Workers' 5th Affiliate after its head got beaten by Eli Jang.\nSimilarities in Fighting Style\nWhile all of the 1st generations fight in distinct styles, all of them run with a consistent theme of training one part of their body to reach its full potential. James Lee trained his legs to become so fast that no one could ever see his attacks, Jichang Kwak trained his hands and upper forearms to make his chops as sharp as blades, Taesoo Ma trained his left fist to become strong enough to crank even boulders, Gongseob Ji trained his torso to make his body be as durable as steel and Seokdu Wang trained his forehead to be able to kill people with just one headbutt.\nNameless Kings\nOriginal King of Chungcheong:\nWe know of his existence thanks to a mention by\nJames Lee\n, apparently he was defeated and usurped by\nJichang\n, after this it is not known what happened to this King. The curious thing about him is that he dominated an entire province, in which there are several cities that could easily have other Kings, even with that problem he was able to dominate the entire place. It is unknown if in Lookism, Chungcheong is just one province OR if it is also divided in two like in real life. If he were the latter, it would mean that he dominated North and South Chungcheong, thus he would be known as the King of Chungcheong. From his level we only know that he is weaker than\nJichang\n, so there is no way to calculate his strength, but he can/could/would be immensely powerful even to be stronger than Suwon, Seongnam and Pyeongtaek kings as he ruled over an area bigger than Seokdu, Pyeongtaek king and Seongnam king areas combined (now not assuming he is stronger than those three combined just that he ruled over an area larger), and it is also in the countryside and we know with Vin Jin that the only fun things to do in the country side is to fight.\nGallery\nEp. 359\n- The circles of the 1st generation\nEp. 359\n- James Lee looming over his enemies\nEp. 492\n- All Kings arrives at Cheongliang\nEp. 492\n- All King help request by Seongji\nSeoul King\nThe Legend\nChungcheong King, Former Seoul King\nDaegu King\nAnsan King\nSuwon King\nIncheon King\nCheonliang King\nPyeongtaek King\nSeongnam King\nTrivia\nIt is unknown who were the members of the\npre-generation\nthat recruited students for their power struggles.\nEvery time James Lee fights a King, the background goes up in flames.

        "history": "The End of the First Generation\nAfter\nJames Lee\ntook down the First Generation by himself, Charles Choi had ambitions to skyrocket his business and accomplish his \"big plan\". This was when he founded the Ten Geniuses, nurturing each of these individuals to excel in their specialized fields, and to assist him in his dealings as well.\nTwo main individuals would mainly act in this, namely\nGun Park\nand\nGoo Kim\n, establishing a large network of debt collecting businesses throughout Korea, They threatened the local crews that they would be destroyed completely if they did not pay up their dues.\nThe Founding of the Four Major Crews\nCharles Choi then ordered Gun and Goo to start collecting dues from 4 crews in Seoul consisting of minors. Before this, they went to scout Gangbuk's legendary shoe thief\nJohan Seong\nand later successfully convince him to be the leader of the\nGod Dog\ncrew, in hopes that he would able to earn enough money to pay for his mother's eye surgery.\nAt the same time,\nEugene\nbegan to formulate the business plan for the\nWorkers\n, another crew included watching over the Gangnam district.\nAfter Gangbuk, they went to Gangseo to find the reputable\nBig Deal\nled by\nSinu Han\n. Sinu had put up strong resistance but was ultimately unable to save Big Deal from becoming one of the Four Major Crews. In order to prevent Big Deal from being annhilated, Sinu sold himself to the newly founded Workers for 2.2 Billion Won, leaving\nJake Kim\nin charge.\nAfter acquiring three crews, Gun went to Gangdong to recruit the last crew. He originally planned to recruit\nBack Door\nbut was later impressed by\nEli Jang\n's prowess and\nOlly Wang\n's business plans, putting\nHostel\nas the fourth and last crew. After a series of unforseeable incidents and Eli Jang's disappearance, Hostel split into two,\nHostel A\nbeing the one that pays the debts.\nThe Start of the Four Major Crews\nFinally, Seoul was divided into\nNorth: God Dog\n,\nSouth: Workers\n,\nEast: Hostel\n, and\nWest: Big Deal\n. After this Charles would be able to start his business and rise the ranks in the world, he spent less and less attention to the Four Major Crews and Gun would take control. He would take the 3 out of the 4 crew heads and train them to become his successors. He wanted one of them to rise and give him an entertaining challenge and to motivate them, he would offer an immense amount of money and power if any of his candidates were able to unite the Four Major Crews under his leadership. While the Crews would usually kept to themselves, due to this newfound promise and the pressure of making the monthly quota, tensions would rise in Seoul as each crew leader vied for Gun's succession, and like the Generations before them, they soon began fighting for territory and this tension would last for 2 years.\nDaniel Park enters the picture\nIn order to obtain the secret as to why Daniel Park has two bodies, DG requests Daniel to unite the Four Major Crews. As he does so, he uncovers the evil deeds each crew has been doing for money: Hostel exploiting the Runaway Fam, Big Deal's Numbers Racket and God Dog's fake bank account scams.\nFate of the Crews\nGod Dog had self-destructed and was disqualified by Gun after J-High and the Burn Knuckles had intervened and put a stop to their illegal businesses, leaving Johan Seong as its lone member.\nAfter God Dog,\nDaniel Park\ntargetted Hostel next. He managed to rise through the ranks and infiltrate Olly Wang's Hostel A and reunite Hostel B. Eli had conflict with Olly which ultimately led to Hostel B's destruction and Hostel A's disqualification.\nAfter Hostel, Daniel Park went to find clues regarding James Lee, which led him to Moon High School, where he encounters Gun Park. After a long time fighting, Gun is impressed with Daniel's fighting and gives him the Black Badge and a ONE MCN card, instructing him to destroy the Workers on his behalf.\nLater, Jake Kim is released from prison and recovers Sinu Han from the Workers, and as a result wages war on them. The Workers make the first move and attack Big Deal street. They fail to burn down Big Deal street after facing strong resistance from both Big Deal and J-High, but the police, siding with the Workers, interfere and Big Deal is now wanted for causing \"a gang fight between teenagers and illegal immigrants\".\nThe Workers\nhave\nHostel\non their side,\nGod Dog\nis gone, and\nBig Deal\nis on the brink of extinction. The Workers have managed to unify the Four Major Crews.\nIn response,\nDaniel\ncreates his Crew\n\"Allied\"\nwhose purpose is to stop the\nWorkers\n, although Daniel is also interested in stopping\nCharles Choi\n.\nFour Major Crews\nSee main article:\nFour Major Crews\nThe Four Major Crews in the Seoul area were divided by territory, with J-High located in central Seoul, right in the middle of the four crews. After the battle between Big Deal and the Workers, the four crews were unified under the Workers.\nThe Four Major Crews:\nBig Dea\nl\n- Crew of Gangseo (West)\nGod Dog\n- Crew of Gangbuk (North)\nWorkers\n- Crew of Gangnam (South)\nHostel\n- Crew of Gangdong (East)\nSynthesis\nGeneration 1.5/\"generation\" of geniuses\nThis \"generation\" would take place after James Lee finished the First Generation. Charles Choi would manage to train the 10 geniuses, it is not known if before or after the death of Gapryong Kim. The legend of Generation 0 would suddenly die and no one knows how or why. From the statements of some characters, it is known that the King of Seoul and James Lee were the ones who killed Gapryong Kim. It is unknown which of these statements is true or if they are both correct (that is, that the two killed Gapryong Kim). Shortly after, Charles with some of his geniuses would begin the second generation.\nSinu Han (\nThe Boy of Promise\n)\nGoo Kim (\nThe Weapon Genius\n)\nGun Park (\nShiro Oni\n)\nGeneration 2/generation of the 4 major crews\nThese\ncrews\nwhich were created by\nCharles Choi\nare meant to make money for Charles Choi to start his own business with some criminal activities. These crews are\nWorkers\n,\nBig Deal\n,\nHostal\nand\nGod Dog\n. They can only get money legally, but they can also get money illegally (not to be caught though, obviously).\nCharles\nstill had 10 of his geniuses to help him with his business in different aspects and areas, that is, each genius has a responsibility to help him in a certain area in which his expertise lies. Of the\nten geniuses\n, we know 7 of them:\nCrystal Choi\n,\nGun Park\n,\nGoo Kim\n,\nDiego Kang(DG)\n,\nKouji\n,\nTom Lee\nand\nJinyoung Park\n(with the latter it is a surprise that he will help\nCharles\n).\nConclusion:\nThe Workers\nwere able to unite the\nfour crews\n, they have\nHostel\non their side,\nGod Dog\nis no more, they dominated the territory (Gangseo) of\nBig Deal\n.\nDaniel\ncreated his own\ncrew\nto stop them, though upon learning of\nCharles Choi's\nmisdeeds, he too is interested in stopping the latter.\nMembers\nAllied\nDaniel Park\nZack Lee\nVasco\nVin Jin\nHudson Ahn\nJay Hong\n*Suhyeon Kim\n*Jihan Kwak\n*\nNot \"Official Member\"\nBurn Knuckles\nVasco\nJace Park\nLeonn Lee\nDamon Goh\nWoong\nJimmy Wang\nMason Hwang\nIra Oh\nSeongryong Choi\nDwight\nTen Geniuses\nCrystal\nKouji\nGod Dog\nJohan Seong\nBig Deal\nJake Kim\nJerry Kwon\nJason Yoon\nBrad Lee\nLua Im\nLineman\nHostel B\nEli Jang\nSally Park\nWarren Chae\nMax Kang\nDerrick Jo\nRyan the Cat\nAmy Lee\nNatalie Cho\nYenna Jang\nAnsan Public\nHudson Ahn\nChanning Choi\nJacky Lee\nWorkers\nEugene\nMandeok Bang\nYuseong\nHangyeoul Baek\nMitsuki Soma\nRyuhei Kuroda\nKenta Magami\nSato Kazuma\nTaegon Wi\nHwang Ho\nSowol Jin\nHuseong Ha\nVivi\nXiaolong\nSeokdu Staffing Agency\nChangyong Ji\nDosu Lee\nTaekbeom Ju\nByeonggwang Heo\nByeonggeon Heo\nK House\nJin Jang\nJin Jang's girlfriend\nScott Kwon\nIvan Park\nHope Park\nDominic Min\nMark Sa\nSeth Lee\nMatt Kang\nBrett Lee\nLoyalty\nPartnership\nBackdoor Members\nDarius Hong\nEthan Hwang\nWally Lee\nCheongliang Fam\nMC Pesticides\nMC Rice Bag\nGoo Kim and His Secret Friends\nSamuel Seo\nCheon Taejin\nIsu Jo\nLogan Lee\nAlexander Hwang\nDeceased Members\nOlly Wang\nJiho Park\nMysteries\nOne of the mysteries of this generation is the second body of Daniel. Apparently a perfected version of the protagonist (Daniel), his own fighting style was unknown until he entered the UI state. In this state, he showed that he knows all kinds of martial arts. For now, there is no clue to his identity. The alarming thing about the second body would be his resemblance to Daniel Park and Jinyoung Park.\nAnother mystery is related to the second body of Daniel and James Lee. And this mystery would be why Daniel (big) has the identity of James Lee. If Charles Choi could create a false identity for James Lee (the false identity is Diego Kang) why didn't he do the same with Daniel (big)? He decided to give him an existing identity, instead of giving him a fake one like he did with James Lee.\nThe true identity of Big Daniel is unknown, for a moment it was believed to be James Lee but it was confirmed that it was someone else. Therefore there is no clue who he could be, much less because he looks like \"little\" Daniel and Jinyoung Park.\nSomehow, Jinyoung Park was one of Charles Choi's 10 geniuses. This would clearly mean that he helped him in some way, the question is why would he do that? It was recently mentioned that there was a feud between Jinyoung Park and Elite/Charles, so it is unlikely that Jinyoung decided to help him. Possibly Jinyoung was threatened or his family was threatened.\nApparently, Jinyoung has a memory that makes him want to die. One would think it was because of Gapryong's death, but in his fight against Tom Lee it was shown that Jinyoung already knew about Gapryong's death and believed that Tom Lee was his killer (for unknown reasons). But in the middle of the fight he remembered something that made him completely crazy.\nThe last detail related to Jinyoung Park would be the comment he made when he discovered Daniel's secret. Jinyoung wondered if the same thing happened to Daniel. That dialogue can have two interpretations. First, the other person who also has a second body like Daniel could be Jinyoung Park (his second body of his or his original body would be a mystery). Second, Jinyoung knows another person who has two bodies (he possibly knows about Crystal's case because he is one of the ten geniuses or maybe he knows another character who had two bodies).\nJames Lee's intentions to find Jinyoung Park are uncertain. In case he's an infiltrator working for Charles Choi in secret, he'll obviously kill Jinyoung or something. And in case he really did betray Charles Choi, there's no telling why James Lee is so sure that Jinyoung Park knows secrets that could hurt Charles. Daniel did well to continue to mistrust James Lee, he has no good reason to trust him.\nAbout the above unknown, we can also wonder about the comment Charles Choi makes in chapter 177. After Daniel asked him about the identity and origin of the perfect body, Charles says that he will tell him when he surpasses DG. Then Charles mentions that DG made him a lot of money but he became too important/big. Charles Choi probably already knew that DG would betray him at some point, that would explain why he wanted to recruit Jichang to his side. Although another reason why he did the latter could be due to the unpredictability in Goo's actions and what he intends to do. And if it was for both reasons, Charles would be losing two very important allies, but considering that Charles Choi has the power to destroy all four teams, it is very certain that he will have several people who are at the level of a King of First Generation or higher (which we currently don't know about). Which would not be unusual since Eugene himself has several allies of that caliber.\nWas the death of Daniel's father a murder? Daniel's grandmother went crazy when she saw the resemblance that the latter had with Jinyoung Park. She mistook Daniel for Jinyoung and shouted, claiming that he had killed her son (Daniel's Father).\nWhy did James Lee change his identity to Diego Kang?  He was more than capable to take down the First Generation in their prime, now that they have aged and some lost body parts, why would he fear them?\nGallery\nEp. 368\n- James Lee claims that the second generation is far from weak"

        "synopsis": "Episode 58\nThe store begins with\nEnu\n, a dog who is owned by a girl. Enu is a crossbreed so she is ridiculed by her owner's friends and relatives. The girl decides to abandon Enu and keep her mother, who is a purebred. Enu remains near her owner's scarf that she threw away and refuses to let anyone nearby, hoping her owner will return to her.\nAt the fashion department there is a new transfer student called\nCrystal Choi\n. She is a short, fat girl who is not very attractive. Because of this she gets bullied.\nDaniel\ntries to befriend Crystal because he remembers being in her situation but she rejects him because he is handsome. Crystal thinks all handsome guys are shallow jerks.\nWhen Crystal is walking home she spies\nVin\nharassing Enu. She stands up for the dog and they begin harassing her. Daniel appears and takes interest in the dog.\nEpisode 59\nDaniel begins treating Crystal with kindness, and other girls get jealous. They draw on her books and make fun of her secretly in front of her face. The leader of the bullies is\nYui\n, who thinks Crystal is after\nZack.\nCrystal goes to find Enu and feed her. Daniel arrives to do the same thing, and asks her if school life is hard. Crystal tells him she can handle it just like Enu handles her life, and Daniel begins to fall for her fat body. At nighttime, Crystal prepares to leave home in her second body, which is more attractive.\nEpisode 60\nCrystal is the daughter of\na wealthy businessman\n. She lives alone and switches between her bodies. Crystal's bodyguard\nGun\ndrives her to her father's meetings where she sits next to him. Guys are attracted to her, so they try to please her father. Their shallow behavior confirmed her beliefs that all handsome men are shallow.\nCrystal meets Daniel at night near the convenience store. He recognizes her as the pretty girl who visits him a lot. Crystal asks if he wants to exercise with her to get stronger, and he tells her the same thing she told him. She begins to fall for his old body.\nZoe\ncomes to see Daniel and wonders if Crystal likes him, but she can't believe it because he is handsome. Enu sits alone in the rain and a stranger appears.\nEpisode 61\nThe stranger who appeared is Daniel. He had washed Enu's owner's scarf and brought it back to her. He makes her a cardboard house and she goes into labor. Crystal watches from afar and admires Daniel's kindness.\nCrystal spends the rest of the week talking to\nKitae Hong\n, the son of the H group CEO. She ends up skipping class, so she decides to go to school in her other body pretending to be her sister.\nEpisode 62\nCrystal notices the people who were rude to her other body treating her with admiration. She is cold to them and rejects Vin's request for her number. Daniel can't stand her rudeness to people she just met and glares at her. She notices Daniel's glare and they start to resent each other.\nDaniel continues to care for Enu's pups and they grow healthy. They decide to live with Daniel and Enu follows him home. Daniel can't take care of all the dogs so he is looking for a home that is close by.\nJay\nvolunteers to raise them, even though he is afraid of dogs.\nNotes\nThe arc lasts at least three months, as it starts before Enu has given birth to her puppies and we later see Jay adopting the puppies when they are three months old.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "history": "With the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the\nFour Major Crews\n, Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers be and continue to grow in power, He decided to create a crew, with the only goal being collapse and eventual eradication of Workers.\nTheir base of operations takes place in an abandoned Youth Construction warehouse for the Burn Knuckles. Daniel arrived at the scene with\nZack Lee\nand\nVasco\nalready waiting for him inside. After seeing how strong the Workers were during the\nHunt for Big Deal\n, the two agreed to join his crew.\nDaniel thanked them once again for joining his cause and introduced to them two more members of Allied. While they were cautious about him joining due to his social status, they welcomed\nJay Hong\nto the crew. His reason for joining was to find out why Big Daniel disappeared and thought the Workers had something to do with it. The second member to join was a bit more controversial, Zack and Vasco exhibited discernible signs of discontent and dissatisfaction stemming from memories of the torment inflicted upon them during the events of the\nOne Night III\nArc, it was no other than the crew head of\nAnsan Public\n,\nHudson Ahn\n. Zack and Vasco show reluctance to be associated with someone seemingly aligned with their past tormentors, Daniel explains to them why he asked him to join and tries to speak up in defense of him, However, Hudson cuts him off halfway through. He explains that he's not here to apologize or seek revenge, he believes that his crew already paid the price for attacking Seoul and he's here for revenge against Eli Jang. While they still were hesitant to let him join, after thoughtful consideration of the dangers they face as a result of their goal of bringing down Workers, they reluctantly accept Hudson's inclusion in the crew. Thus creating the Allied Crew, with its original 5 members, with the objective also to find clues where Daniel's other body was hidden by\nJinyoung Park\n, one of the Pre-generation.\nAfter the events of the\nHolidays 2\nand\nFuneral\nArc,\nJihan Kwak\nand\nJibeom Kwak\n, respectively the No.1 and No.2 of the Chungcheong crew, started to help Daniel and the rest of the crew in their pursuit of eradicating Workers, as both vengeance for the death of\nJichang Kwak\n, and vengeance for both\nEugene\nand\nCharles Choi\n. They agreed to work together with Daniel and the rest of the Allied crew for the time being in order to locate\nJinyeong Park\nto strategize their revenge against\nCharles Choi\nfor killing\nJichang Kwak\nand\nBakgu Noh\n.\nThe Allied is also helped by\nJace Park\n, the No.2 of\nBurn Knuckles\n, who acts as their tactician by providing them with information's and strategies.\nAnd a few chapters after the\nLookism\nArc begins. Despite being rejected in\nEpisode 444\n, Daniel was able to persuade\nVin Jin\n, another very powerful figure, to join their cause as a new member of the Allied crew after presenting him the profiles of the\nFirst Affiliate'\ns Executives they will fight in their goal to abolish workers.\nAlexander Hwang\nbegan to help the team trough the Workers First Affiliate as their navigator in exchange for his freedom, putting the building's floorplans to his back.\nThe team is also working along with\nBig Deal's\nHead\nJake Kim\naiding each other in their respective goals and\nHostel\n's Dad\nEli Jang\nwho, convinced through the efforts from\nVasco\n, defected from the Workers and decided to trust the Allied by assisting them in order to defeat the organization. And by extension, also their respectively right arms Big Deal's No.2\nJerry Kwon\nand Hostel's Uncle\nWarren Chae\n, who also defected from the Workers, associated themselves with Allied.\nBusan\nDaniel Park\nwas contacted by\nDG\nwho told Daniel that another Four Major Crew was operating in Busan and that the appearance of\nJinrang\nhad united the crews. Learning this, Daniel contacted all the members of Allied and took them to Busan to take on Busan's Four Major Crews. Allied uses Vasco's connection to\nSeonong Ham\nin Busan to know of Choi Bongpal, one of the heads of a major crew and the one who cultivated an illicit drug business. Daniel made Allied impersonate as people from\nClub Vivi\nand spent enough money from Jay to convice Choi Bongpal of his identity as Club Vivi. Allied went to Choi Bongpal's hideout where they found illicit drugs and, having their cover blown, threaten Choi Bongpal of having all the drugs burned.\nChoi Bongpal shows up and Allied used a very accurate Lie Detector to find her motives, she decided to help Allied as she can simply take over a crew after Allied dismantles it.

He tells Daniel that the Burn Knuckles are not a crew but can be just as powerful.\nAs Daniel sits on a bench he overhears his dog fighting another dog. He runs to save Enu and comes across\nJohan Seong\n. They apologize to each other and start running together, leaving their dogs behind. Daniel mentions the God Dogs and Johan is surprised. He asks how Daniel knows them and he explains that they are criminals. Johan suddenly asks Daniel to race, and Daniel loses the race.\nDaniel is shocked that Johan won against his better body. As they catch their breath Johan asks about Daniel's family. Daniel says he has a mother and Johan says he has his dog\nEden\n. They get up to leave but notice their dogs are missing and panic.

        "synopsis": "Episode 41\nThe\nJ High\nkids go on a field trip to a retreat in the fall.\nDaniel\nis excited to be sitting next to friends instead of by himself.\nThe buses with J High freshmen inside stop at a place with games that test one's strength. Zack and Vin compete with each other to get the highest score. However, Vasco decides to join in and tells Daniel to join him. Vasco breaks the hammer game, and Daniel rips the punching bag of the punching game.\nWhen they get to the retreat they discover there are other schools present as well. They are met by two instructors who tell them to open their bags for search.\nEpisode 42\nThey introduce themselves as Won Bin and\nHeemin\n, or Zeus. Won Bin is an ugly instructor so he is teased by students. Zeus is conventionally attractive so the girls fall for him.The students participate in the arts festival and everyone gets to shine.\nDoo\nleads Daniel down a hall to drink with the Beauty Department girls but he leaves with\nZack\nto go to\nMira's\nroom. Daniel invites\nYui\n,\nJiho\nand\nZoe\nas well. They decide to play a drinking game and everyone gets wasted except Mira. When Daniel wakes up to exercise his boss discovers someone is taking creepshots of the girls at the retreat.\nEpisode 43\nThe next day begins and the kids go rafting. Won Bin notices the girls laughing at Zeus when he splashes them but complaining when he does. Mira gets suspicious of Won Bin, who keeps looking at her the entire trip. Won Bin goes to the teachers room and notices them drinking. He is disgusted by their behavior and goes to find Mira.\nWon Bin finds Mira in the store room helping Zeus lift some boxes. He tackles Zeus and they start fighting. Mira helps Zeus fend off Won Bin and he thanks her. Then he turns and starts acting creepy. Daniel finds in his old body a poster of Zeus as a sex offender, specifically a rapist.\nThe reason Won Bin had Mira's picture was because he wanted to find who was taking creepshots. He found Zeus hanging out near her and found him on the pervert website posting the creepshots. Zeus attacks Mira and tells her to take off her clothes.\nEpisode 44\nZeus has flashbacks to his past as a child. He was always allowed to get away with hurting others because he was handsome. Girls would cheat on their boyfriends, which fueled his perverted views on sex. He even raped girls because he believed everyone secretly liked him. Won Bin attacks Zeus and he starts beating him.\nZack asks the other students if they've seen Mira. Daniel wakes up in his other body and calls the police to report a sex offender. Zack overhears the conversation and races out the room to find Mira. He walks in to find Zeus taking off Mira's clothes and blood on her face.\nEpisode 45\nZack attacks Zeus and discovers he is another fighter. Zeus is trained in Muay Thai, and he breaks both his arms. Won Bin grabs the rapist and buys enough time for Zack to beat him. He does so even though his arms are broken. When Daniel and the others arrive, they find Zack is still beating Zeus.\nWon Bin and Zack are taken to the emergency room and Zack needs two casts. He doesn't mind because Mira gets to feed him while he is out. Zeus goes to prison for attempted rape and is found by\nGangnam Landlord\n, Zoe's old stalker, who proceeds to beat him.\nNotes\nThe supervisor Won Bin has the same name as a famous celebrity.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

There, it is revealed that Baekho died on the same day as Gapryong Kim.\n[\n1\n]\nAlthough not much is mentioned about Baekho, there is a panel of him, Gapryong, young Jerry and young Jake standing in front of each other in episode 412.\n[\n4\n]",

So with that we can assume that while Baekho may have been more physically stronger, have higher attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Gapryong Kim, Gapryong Kim would still win the fight as he has every other stat going for him and Baekho would never have fought him. Also in chapter 456 it is shown that the strongman Jaesoo Noh who could kill boars with one ax swing with his forearm regretting and wishing hell for his luck that he got stuck with fighting with \"Not fighting just anyone but Baekho Kwon's son\", indicating how much of a monster in terms of strength Baekho Kwon was.\nQuotes\nTBA\nTrivia\nBaekho's name means white tiger in Korean which is also the same as the\nWhite Tiger Job Centre (Baekho HRM)\n.\nTom Lee states that Baekho Kwon was also part of the pre generation.\n[\n3\n]\nDuring a flashback Jerry has in episode 417 of him and Jake as children, young Jerry says that Baekho was the one who told him that Jerry was Jake's subordinate.\n[\n5\n]\nGallery\nJake Kim (Arc)\nEp. 312\n- Gapryong & Baekho leaving\nEp. 312\n- Baekho suprised\nEp. 312\n- Baekho suprised 2\nJames Lee (Arc)\nEp. 359\n- Gapryong running for elections\nThe Hunt for Big Deal\nEp. 412\n- Jerry remembers his oath\nEp. 415\n- Jerry's flashback\nEp. 456\n- Jaesu recognises Jerry\nA Drink Between Brothers\nEp. 479\n- Jinyeong remembers Baekho is dead\nWhite Ghost\n1\nScreenshot 2024-11-01 160949.png\n2\nUnknown Chapter/Arc\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\nEpisode 411\n\u2191\nEpisode 312\n\u2191\n3.0\n3.1\nEpisode 402\n\u2191\nEpisode 412\n\u2191\nEpisode 417\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nMinor Character Navigation\nAdults\nAru Lee\n\u2022\nBrekdak\n\u2022\nDaniel's mother\n\u2022\nDaniel's Manager\n\u2022\nJohan's mother\n\u2022\nLasol\n\u2022\nOliver Jang\nMinors\nWoojin\n\u2022\nDaehoon Shin\n\u2022\nSeonong Ham\n\u2022\nSoomi\n\u2022\nStalker Girl\n\u2022\nTikTacTok Girl\n\u2022\nWally Lee\n\u2022\nYenna Jang\n\u2022\nYeonhui\n\u2022\nYong Lee\nAnimals\nEnu\n\u2022\nEden\n\u2022\nMiro\n\u2022\nRyan the Cat"

        "history": "The Bicheon Gang was created by Vivi's father. He rounded up orphaned and abandoned children and raised them to become soldiers for his company. Xiaolong was one of these children.\n[\n1\n]\nHe eventually rose to the No. 1 position by helping prevent a mutiny taking place.\n[\n2\n]\nXiaolong was asked to be Vivi's father's bodyguard, but he decided to stay with Vivi instead.\nXiaolong recruited many of the other members into the Bicheon Gang. Huseong Ha's gang was bought monetarily. Taegon Wi, Hwang Ho and Sowol Jin were scouted personally for their talent. Xiaolong also helped train much of the later Bicheon gang, the majority of whom were victims from a large fire.\n[\n3\n]\nXiaolong and his men continued to stay with Vivi as she made trips back and forth to Korea for her drug business.\nOrganization\nThe Bicheon Gang has an intense hierarchy system. Children must fight to prove themselves capable of joining (the fate of the losers is unknown). None of their members are allowed to have names: instead they have numbers. The Cheon gang are the highest ranks of the Bicheon gang, and they are taught the secret\nCheon Hohuigong\nmartial art.\nMembers\nMembers\nTaegon Wi\nSowol Jin\nHwang Ho\nHuseong Ha\nBicheon Gang\nFormer Members\nXiaolong",

        "history": "Big Deal is a gang with history in Gangseo. Not much is known about their origins except that they have been there for a while. Sinu Han took over the gang as a child and made some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.\nWhen Jake Kim was third in command he was in a dispute with the leader of Big Deal, Sinu Han, who chose to sell Big Deal to the Workers for extra money. Jake decided against it, and won the favor of the rest of Big Deal. Since then, he has been the leader of Big Deal. His caring demeanor to his subordinates makes Big Deal one of the most loyal out of the 4 big crews. Only later did Jake learn that Sinu Han did not mean to sell Big Deal, but decided to sell himself to the Workers instead. Since then, Jake has worked hard to bring Sinu back from the Workers and fulfill Gun's requirements to be a potential successor.\nOrganization\nBig Deal's organization is a number system, with a lower number being more important. Jake Kim used to be the leader of the YB branch, but since then Big Deal has dissolved into one large association. The previous No.1\nBig Boss\nand No. 2\nOld Face\nhave been removed when Big Deal made Jake Kim their leader. After the dissolution of\nGod Dog\n, the remaining members under Jin Jang joined Big Deal. Since then however, they have abandoned the crew to join the\nWorkers\n.\nBig Deal is the most romantic of the four crews. They do not fight dirty, and they don't accept people who do so.\n[\n1\n]\nJake has however briefly taken an interest in\nJiho Park\n, but he did not end up joining the crew.\nMembers\nBig Boss\nJake Kim (No. 1)\nMembers\nJerry Kwon (No. 2)\nJason Yoon (No. 3)\nBrad Lee (No. 4)\nLuah Lim (No.5)\nLineman (No.6)\nFormer Members\nSinu Han\nOld Face\nSamuel Seo\nAlexander Hwang\nDarius Hong",

Throughout the series, he is forced to wear a variety of clothing ranging from stereotypical Vietnamese attire to stylish clothing.\nHowever, Brekdak without a shirt is revealed to possess highly developed musculature, notably having a very wide back.",
        "personality": "Brekdak is a kind, unassuming man with a hard-working personality and distaste towards violence if it can be avoided. He is notably motivated primarily by his family and love of Muay Thai in all his endeavours, going so far as to allow himself to be degraded on a daily basis in order to earn money to support his family.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Brekdak is implied to be the premier Muay Thai fighter in the world, despite being retired. His prowess is such that he is not only acknowledged by\nGun\n, but has Gun as his fan.\nDue to his tutelage of Vasco, it can be assumed that all of Vasco's current techniques is comparable or even inferior to Brekdak's with many of Brekdak's personal and \"Forbidden Techniques\" being among the more powerful techniques in Lookism.\nQuotes\nA good friend told me to be a man\n[\n2\n]\n.\n- Brekdak to Seonong\nTrivia\nBrekdak's original name neither recognizes by Thai readers nor sounds like one at all.

In particular, he has sold Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food.\nGallery\nManager Kim\nBrekdak in Manager Kim\nThanksgiving Arc\nEp. 153\nSeonong goes to Seoul\nEp. 158\n- Brekdak thanking Seonong\nEp. 159\n- Brekdak calling\nEp. 160\n- Brekdak's back\nEp. 160\n- Everything is resvolved\nVasco's Blind Date\nEp. 178\n- Story Flashback 2\nGod Dog Arc\nEp. 212\n- Brekdak staring at Gun\nEp. 213\n- Brekdak giving his autograph to Gun\nOne Night\nEp. 260\n- Brekdak & Vasco meet again\nEp. 261\n- Vasco training with Brekdak\nEp. 262\n- Vasco leaves\nOne Night II\nEp. 320\n- Brekdak working\nEp. 322\n- Brekdak going into club\nEp. 323\n- Brekdak ready to fight\nEp. 324\n- Brekdak giving advice\nThe Hunt for Big Deal\nEp. 424\n- Brekdak telling Vasco he taught him everything he knows\nEp. 426\n- Gun sees Vasco to be similar to Brekdak\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 458\n- Vasco's flashback 2\nEp. 459\n- Brekdak using runners high\nReferences\n\u2191\nEpisode 160\n\u2191\nEpisode 160\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nMinor Character Navigation\nAdults\nAru Lee\n\u2022\nBrekdak\n\u2022\nDaniel's mother\n\u2022\nDaniel's Manager\n\u2022\nJohan's mother\n\u2022\nLasol\n\u2022\nOliver Jang\nMinors\nWoojin\n\u2022\nDaehoon Shin\n\u2022\nSeonong Ham\n\u2022\nSoomi\n\u2022\nStalker Girl\n\u2022\nTikTacTok Girl\n\u2022\nWally Lee\n\u2022\nYenna Jang\n\u2022\nYeonhui\n\u2022\nYong Lee\nAnimals\nEnu\n\u2022\nEden\n\u2022\nMiro\n\u2022\nRyan the Cat"

        "name": "Burn Knuckles",
        "history": "The Burn Knuckles was founded by\nVasco\nduring his first year in high school. The story goes that he would grab delinquents by the shoulder and warn them to stop smoking. The students were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department and join the first generation of Burn Knuckles. Since then, underclassmen have also joined to form the second generation of Burn Knuckles.\nThe purpose of the Burn Knuckles is to protect. Vasco believes that power exists to protect the weak. The Burn Knuckles abide by that principle strictly, and are very loyal to Vasco. They will not fight unless he gives the order to. Their strength and loyalty has led some characters like\nDaniel\nto compare Burn Knuckles to the four crews, but\nJace\ndisagrees with this comparison, stating that the Burn Knuckles are only friends of Vasco and nothing more.\nThe Burn Knuckles' location in Central Seoul has led to the four crews being hesitant to establish main operations there. However, this has not stopped gangs like\nBig Deal\nand\nGod Dog\nfrom attempting to take over Central Seoul. In the God Dog Arc, Vasco swore to help Daniel defeat the four crews alongside him. Since then, the Burn Knuckles have been antagonistic towards the four crews.\nOrganization\nVasco is the leader and the founder of the Burn Knuckles, and is their main source of strength. Aside from him, Burn Knuckles have seven executive members called the Seven Meisters. They are also known as the \"Tool Council\" because they all carry a tool of some kind; whether this is because of their status as Architecture students is unknown. The seven are listed below:\n\"Monkey Spanner\"\nJace Park\n(Burn Knuckles Strategist, & Second in Command)\n\"Seoul Tour Helper\"\nWoong\n\"The Nutcracker\"\nIra Oh\n\"Crying Hammer\"\nMason Hwang\n\"Flying Nipper\"\nJimmy Wang\n\"Cute Duck\"\nDamon Goh\n\"Safety Helmet\"\nSeongryong Choi\nThe Burn Knuckles used to have black leather jackets as their uniform.

        "history": "To be added...\nOrganization\nBusan is separated into 4 areas, also called \"Turfs\", these areas are numbered from 1 to 4. Each of these areas is organized by a specific crew, with each crew having someone as its head.\nIn total, there are 5 heads for the 4 areas, with Area 1 having one more head. It is possible to determine the head of that area by means of a silver ring with the symbol of Busan that they are often wearing.\nIn the case of Jinrang, who recently became the leader of these unified crews, he wears a golden ring with the symbol of Busan.\nArea 1\nArea 1 is widely known for its \"roombar\" business. A roombar is an adult entertainment establishment where customers can pay to drink and chat in private rooms with hostesses.\nThis business is managed by\nArin Shin\nand\nJihoon Min\n. Currently, Area 1 is facing problems with the emergence of a karaoke bar in the area, managed by\nHudson Ahn\nand owned by\nAnsan Public\n.\nArea 2\nIn Area 2, there are several pubs, pubs that have several tables to play the game of \"hold 'em\" poker. Even though pubs with these games are legal, bars are not, and this is what they do away from the spotlight: several bars that play poker illegally, due to the clarification of the rules, apparently they also offer some in-house system in these bars to help players to continue betting.\nIts head is\nHyukjin Park\n.\nArea 3\nArea 3 is directly connected to Busan ports. There, they smuggle young foreign girls, this business is the one that generates the most money among all the Four Big Groups in Busan.\nHis methods are brutal and cruel, he smuggles young girls by hiding them on ships. When the police are about to catch them, they hide the crime by sinking the ship, along with the smuggled girls in the cold ocean.\nIts head is\nSangjin Hyun\n.\nArea 4\nArea 4 has a more direct business: clandestine fights. Initially the place was used to resolve disputes between sailors, but it ended up becoming more and more popular, to the point where most people in the region know about the Arena.\nIt is implied that there are several categories of fights in the Arena, such as fights with bladed weapons or bare hands. Fights are normally carried out one-on-one, with no rules or restrictions on techniques to be used against the opponent. The people watching then choose a fighter that they think will be the winner, and then bet on him, thus, the winnings go to the fighter, and possibly part also goes to whoever is organizing the fight, thus sustaining the Area's business.\nIts head is\nJinchan Kang\n, who is also the Arena champion."

Charles also makes him the CEO of\nPTJ Entertainment\n.\nHe is referenced as being one of Charles Choi's weaknesses, as Charles helped to cover up DG's involvement in one of South Korea's most infamous murder cases, the murder of\nGapryong Kim\n.\nGun Park\nCharles met Gun while working in juvenile prison. He hired him for his fighting prowess. Later on, he hired Gun to be Crystal's bodyguard.\nGoo Kim\nSeveral years prior to the series, Charles sent Gun to test Goo to see if he had potential to become Gun's partner. He later hired him to be his bodyguard. Currently, he is suspicious that Goo is collaborating with Workers in an effort to take him down.\nPre-Generation\nJinyoung Park\nThe two were both comrades working alongside each other. When Charles' old name \"Elite\" was brought up to the current Jinyoung in ep. 403, it sent him into a frenzy.\n[\n1\n]\nTom Lee\nCharles shows respect to his longtime partner, showing that he can count on him for whatever is needed.\nGapryong Kim\nIt is not known what happened between the two, but it appears that at some point, Charles began to disagree with Grapryong.\nOther\nDaniel Park\nAfter Daniel (old body) is lead back to his own house after investigating the true identity of his new body, Charles is seen waiting for Daniel at his house. He begins to attack Daniel who is easily defeated, and says to him that James Lee doesn't exist, and that it was all fabricated to keep his secret safe. Then, after Daniel asks to know why he has the new body, he says that he would have to surpass DG.\nJake Kim\nCharles is initially indifferent towards Jake, sometimes even underestimating him, but seems to admire him for his resemblance to his father.\nSteve Hong\nHe and Steve are both CEOs, and they have known each other for a long time, but are not friends.\n[\n2\n]\nReference\n\u2191\nEpisode 403\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 262"

        "background": "Charles' past is shrouded in mystery, but we know that he was one of the key figures of the\n0th Generation\n, fighting side by side with\nGapryong Kim\n. Charles grew up in a wealthy family that ran a business, but soon after Charles was born, his family went bankrupt and took a mysterious photo near his supermarket, according to\nDG\n, this photo is the solution to the mystery of two bodies, which\nDaniel Park\nand James Lee have not yet been able to solve. The abandoned school that Daniel Park attended occupies a special place in Charles' life, he studied at this school, it contains both good and bad memories, then the photo was stored in this school until Daniel Park got there.\nDuring the\n1st Generation\n, Charles Choi used\nDG\nto kill\nGapryong Kim\n. This incident was completely hidden, according to\nEugene\n, it was the incident with the murder of\nBaekho Kwon\nand\nGapryong Kim\nthat was Charles' weakness.\nAccording to Crystal, Charles is raising ten children, referred to as the \"ten geniuses\", alongside her. Each of these children were chosen for their unique skills and are being groomed to be successful in their respective fields. Of these children are\nGun\n,\nGoo\n,\nKouji\n,\nCrystal\n,\nDG\n,\nTom Lee\nand\nJinyoung Park\n.\nHe created the 4 crews to fund his main business which is unknown at the moment but through backstory we learn that DG, Goo, Gun, and Tom Lee created/immersed the 4 gangs into their plan of funding. Each gang is to bring in 100 million won every month, and there is 4 gangs, which equates to 4.8 billion won. His true objective is unknown right now"

        "synopsis": "Episode 325\nDaniel has lost a lot of weight since training with\nSophia\nand he is starting to see positive results. As he is stepping out of the house he smells soap in the air, and a girl his age passes by.\nDoo Lee and Alexander Hwang are getting yelled at for talking too much while working. Doo was taken from the fourth affiliate to work in the third affiliate's cleanup crew. Alexander was sent to the third affiliate to do odd jobs after being taken by\nTom Lee\n. Daniel runs into them crying on the road and decides to buy them some fried chicken. He is reminded of\nLike What\nand\nHilarious\nand sees one of the waitresses being harassed by her boss. Daniel intercepts the boss as he tries to grab the girl, and the boss moves away. He tells the girl she should try making money in other avenues, and that he knows a guy (himself) who made it large using TikTacTok.\nJohan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers. Daniel hands Jake his ID, which says he is 90 years old. Jake tells Daniel minors aren't allowed inside, and Daniel reveals his black VVIP badge.\nEpisode 326\nJake believes Daniel must know something about\nSinu Han\nsince he is a VVIP. He tries to send a signal by sneezing, and Daniel doesn't understand but tries to send his own signals asking about drugs and secrets of the third affiliate.\nVivi's friends Antonio, Michael and Jonathan ask her why she is working in the club, and she tells them about how difficult it is to sell and use drugs in China compared to Korea. They ask her about her other drug business, Pungsan. Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.\nJake and Daniel are finding it difficult to tease information out of each other. Jake gives up and asks Daniel to ask the president about Sinu Han if he sees them, because Sinu is his long lost brother. Daniel says he will, and they go to ask Xiaolong to see the president since he is a VVIP. Vivi and her friends are high in a room lined with mushrooms, so Xiaolong denies them. Daniel says he'll report this to the Workers and Xiaolong grabs him by the neck, saying he doesn't care if Daniel is a VVIP or not, he can always go back to China. Daniel escapes the choke and asks Xiaolong if there are drugs inside that room.\nEpisode 327\nXiaolong considers killing Daniel, and that it would bring a lot of trouble. He eventually lets Daniel and Jake inside the room, which is now completely empty. They search but they don't find any trace of drugs or Sinu. Daniel suspects a secret room is inside there. Alexander Hwang tells him that Vivi only meets with the super rich and influential, so it will be difficult to talk with her. He asks why Daniel is acting poor when he can pay with his black badge. Daniel starts paying for everyone's drinks and the club starts getting wild.\nJohan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him. All of the expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol asks Daniel to come to the president. He comes to a room with several influencers sitting around sweets, along with TikTacTok girl. He eats some of the cookies and asks them where the drugs are, and they tell him that he just ate the drugs: Vivi bakes them into cookies called \"Vivi cookies\". Daniel faints and wakes up in his second body that he rushes into the club with.\nEpisode 328\nTikTacTok girl tries help Daniel but everyone around her is drunk. Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and orders her to get wasted as well. Daniel enters the room to find it's emptied out. Xiaolong tells Daniel he was expecting him to attack the third affiliate, and Jake knocks him out despite taking a heavy blow from Daniel.\nDaniel wakes up in a hotel room where Vivi asks if he's okay. He asks why she cares about him and she tells him her dad said to befriend any billionaire's kid, so she can make friends. When he asks about TikTacTok girl Vivi says if he likes her he can be a part of the treasure hunt she set up with her friends. These rich kids invite influencers they fancy so they can assault them while they are unconscious. Daniel beats the guys and raises his fist at Vivi in anger when Taegon Wi, another Workers executive, throws a kunai at him. The other kids' guards rush in to say that Daniel isn't the son of a billionaire, but an unknown person. Daniel says the third affiliate is rejected from the four crews.\nEpisode 329\nTaegon Wi, also known as \"King Gon\", had fought with\nJustin Peng\nand\nChuck Kwak\nbefore. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it. He chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.\nJake tells Daniel that he is in the VIP room where they grow hallucinogenic mushrooms, what he suspects is the third affiliate's illegal activity. He also tells Daniel that he found out the secret of the room while Alexander was flipping tables: that the room itself rotates. Daniel tells Jake that in the rooms above the club influencers are drugged and taken advantage of. He begs Jake to save them and Jake says he doesn't care, he is only interested in finding Sinu. He switches off with Johan as bouncer but starts to remember Daniel's words. He calls Big Deal and asks them to send two people over, knowing Sinu would have probably wanted that. Jake and Lineman show up to the club.\nNotes\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\n\u201c\nMen are all the same. They trip over themselves if you are pretty.\n\u201d\nCrystal Choi\n(\n\ucd5c\uc218\uc815\nChoi Soo Jung\n) is a secondary character in\nLookism\n. She is currently a student in\nJ High School\n. Like\nDaniel Park\n, she also has two bodies. Crystal Choi is the daughter of the HNH Group chairman,\nCharles Choi\n. She is the heiress of HNH Group and CEO of Crystal TV. She is also a member of the\nTen Geniuses\n.\nBae Jeong-mi voices Crystal in the Lookism animated series.",
        "appearance": "Original Body\nIn her original \"attractive\" body, Crystal possesses unrivaled beauty within the series and this, coupled with her status as the HNH chairman's daughter, is usually enough to mark her reputation and status of importance as well above others. Even\nAru Lee\n, a famous idol star, couldn't help but feel jealousy towards the difference in their status as\nDG\ndiligently attended to Crystal's every need, yet wouldn't even bat an eye for Aru.\n[\n3\n]\nCrystal is also fairly tall in this body, with a curvy physique. Ever since Crystal drastically transformed from her past overweight self, she became the sexiest, hottest and most gorgeous girl in the country. So immensely beautiful and attractive that she could have any guy in the country if she wanted.\nCrystal keeping track of her unhealthy diet.\nIn Chapter 60, Crystal recounts her journey from feeling overlooked and unattractive due to her weight and says that she could never imagine being treated with kindness and admiration in the past as she experiences them when she drastically changes and becomes very attractive. This shift has left her skeptical of people's motives when they treat her humanely and kindly. She reveals the extreme lengths she went to in order to transform herself citing that she \u201calmost killed herself to change\u201d, admitting to contemplating drastic measures. Her meticulous tracking of calorie intake and strict adherence to a potentially unhealthy diet regimen underscore the lengths she goes to maintain her current appearance. Crystal wishes she didn\u2019t have to endure a hellish life all over again as she ventures on to keep an eye on Daniel through her alternate, unattractive body, as per her father\u2019s orders.\nCrystal has an immensely good fashion sense, in direct contrast with Daniel, who has terrible fashion sense and only maintains his stunningly fashionable looks with the help of\nJay Hong\n.\n[\n4\n]\nCrystal is very knowledgeable in fashion, even schooling Daniel when she was annoyed at his poor fashion sense despite him being in the fashion department. Crystal seems to prefer dressing in style while in her original attractive body, which may be why she assumed Park Daniel did the same as well (when she was suspicious of him having two bodies). She generally uses this body to attend business related events and issues. Crystal works out quite a lot to maintain this body rather than the unattractive body which indicates that this is her real body.\nAlternate Body\nIn her \u201cunattractive\u201d alternate body, Crystal is strikingly similar to\nDaniel Park\nin his original body (before he lost weight), to the point that it's as if she was the female version of him. Crystal is obese and quite short in this form, approximately the same height as Daniel in the past. Much like Daniel, she is also referred to as 'Pig' by many people due to her size and height; usually girls who are jealous of her getting attention from Daniel in his second body.\nCrystal recounts her exhaustive efforts to alter her physical appearance in this body through all sorts of diets and workout regimens. She was unsuccessful at losing even a bit of weight, henceforth implying that this her alternate body.\nShe has been shown to have a prowess in fighting while in this body as well, as she is seen beating up some bullies during the Picnic Arc in Chapter 144. She has also used the two body system to cheat on exams to get high marks; however, unlike Daniel, she seems to have no shame in using it this way. This could be due to the influence of her father, who shames Daniel for wasting his \"gift\".\nCrystal mostly uses this body for school related events and issues to keep watch of Daniel.",
        "personality": "Crystal's views of men around her.\n[\n5\n]\nIrrespective of what form she is in, Crystal harbors a prejudice towards attractive people, mostly due to how people used to treat her in her past when she was \u201cunattractive\u201d and overweight. She faces the same treatment in her alternate \u201cunattractive\u201d body (that she cannot change since it\u2019s her second body) often being called her derogatory terms, being ostracized and bullied.\nShe developed a cynical outlook towards attractive people, due to how many times she has been humiliated by their fake kindness towards her Unattractive Body. This cynical outlook isn't just exclusive towards attractive people, it also extends towards all people in general\u2014this is because Crystal is the daughter of\nCharles Choi\n, and as his daughter, Crystal has a lot of suitors due to her power and looks. As a result, she tends to generalize attractive people to be egotistical, and believe people to be shallow and superficial.\nThis belief and experiences led Crystal to close off her heart, finding comfort in being alone and genuinely not wanting to rely on other people. This belief also led to her initial distrust of Daniel, initially responding to his friendly actions with caution and politeness, and pushing him away from her because his presence and compassion towards her Unattractive Body at school is causing other girls to bully her.\nDespite Crystal's prejudices and cynical outlook towards other people, she is a kind person at heart. She feeds and take care of\nEnu\nregularly alongside Daniel. She also helped them during the\nIllegal Toto Arc\nusing her Attractive Body which surprised\nKouji\n, stating that she had never bothered to help others before.\n[\n6\n]\nCrystal is slowly but surely maturing as she interacts more with Daniel and his clique and becoming less and less prejudiced.",
        "fighting_prowess": "As\nCharles Choi\n\u2019s daughter and under the protection of the likes of\nJong Gun\nand previously\nGoo Kim\n, she does not have to fight very often, even though she has shown to be quite formidable in her own right. Gun, the training genius, has undertook her training. Although Crystal seems well versed in all sorts of martial arts-even showcasing Kyokushin Karate, Boxing as well as Aikido, and how she seems to quickly identify\nEli Jang\n's moves and tries to find any correlation to the many martial arts she knows, it seems that she has only ever used and possibly learnt it for the sake of self-defence, which is the reason we are yet to see the extent of her full capabilities in combat.\nHowever as she carries the blood of Charles Choi, or Elite, the Second-in-Command or the Underboss of Gapryong Kim\u2019s Fist Gang in the Pre-Generation, she seems to have potential by her superior genes.\nOriginal Body\nCrystal using Gun's Aikido on Matt Kang.\nAt some point, Crystal was trained by\nJong Gun\non how to fight and is fully capable of taking care of herself.\n[\n7\n]\nThe extent of her ability in combat has yet to be explored as she rarely ever has to fight in this body, but since she was trained by a legendary fighter it can be assumed she is a formidable fighter in her own right.\nCrystal first fought when she beat and kicked Daniel\u2019s stalker using\nJong Gun\n\u2019s training in the Stalker arc in Chapter 120\n[\n8\n]\n. Crystal was able to knock Daniel\u2019s stalker who was wielding a taser, using a Kyokushin Karate kick.\nCrystal has also showed enough strength to skillfully knock out Matt Kang, the boss of a small crew based in Cheonliang, for bothering her friends and herself, using the Corkscrew Blow and Gun\u2019s Aikido move, during the Hostel Branch arc in Chapter 258\n[\n9\n]\n.\nAlternate Body\nDespite the hinderance of the height and weight of her alternative body, she is capable of doing jump kicks and was shown beating up three bullies in a bathroom for bothering Zoe, Mira and Yui during the Picnic arc in Chapter 144.\n[\n10\n]\nQuotes\n\"I nearly killed myself to change.\"\n[\n5\n]\n\"Men are all the same.

He also ordered her to keep an eye on Daniel,  because he knows Daniel has two bodies as well.\nAs shown, despite caring for her father, Crystal was not blind to his faults and of how selfish and evil he was. This was shown during his funeral, where Crystal acknowledged that even though her father had so many working under him and had met so many people in his life, no one bothered to go to his funeral. A fact that Crystal found both heartbreaking, but fair, as he had hurt, used and abused so many people during his life and earned the justified hatred of many as well.\nFriends\nKouji\nKouji and Crystal know each other well because Kouji is one of the ten people who were raised by Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. These ten special children are considered prodigies under his care. Even though the two know each other substantially well, they hardly meet unless Crystal needs Kouji's assistance in an emergency or any similar matter. Their relationship is based on money as he will only do her bidding if he makes a profit off of the work.\nDG\nDG and Crystal are close acquaintances and know each other quite well because of Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. His friendship with Crystal surprises many girls since he doesn't show any obvious kindliness to any other girl. Despite being very close to each other, DG and Crystal have no romance in their relationship."

        "background": "As the daughter of the HNH Group Chairman,\nCharles Choi\n, Crystal comes from a very wealthy background. However this was not always the case. Crystal seems to have grown up poor for majority of her life, before her father made his business successful. This is implied when she tells Daniel that she used to live under similar conditions as him, as well as looking into her father's own background. She is one of the few raised by the chairman of HNH Group,\nCharles Choi\n, as well as the only legitimate child and daughter. Crystal (much like Daniel) also has two bodies.\nAt some point, her father tasked her with keeping an eye on Daniel, which is why she transferred to Jae Won High in her alternate body while her original body is usually attending to her other issues after dusk, usually tending to business related issues.\nReferences"

        "synopsis": "Episode 132\nJohan Seong\nused to be childhood friends with\nZack\nand\nMira\n, going to church and school with them. He was a very religious child like\nhis mother\n, and tries to please her by not fighting. However, he still gets bullied in school because he is poor and weak. Usually Zack saves him from his bullies, and Johan is embarrassed whenever Mira sees this because he has a crush on Mira.\nThe reason Johan refuses to let his friends visit is because his mom is delusional. His mother after a period of time lost her sight and while losing her sight she entered a cult for a dog god. His mother rants about being one of the chosen for the 666 and becomes violent, and he doesn't want his friends to see her in that state.\nEpisode 133\nJohan is jealous of Zack's fighting ability and wishes he was as popular. When he spots Mira he gets embarrassed and runs away from her, expecting her to leave him alone. Mira decides to visit him anyway, and his mother invites her to visit a new church called \"Eden\" that she joined.\nJohan confides in\na priest\nand tells him he suspects his mother is in a cult. The priest decides to accompany him to keep an eye on his mother. Zack tags along as well, to hang out with Mira. In the cult a man is tied to a cross and is desperate to escape the cult.\nEpisode 134\nThe four of them set off to the cult and Zack is attacked by a dog. He is saved by the priest, who is suspicious of the place. They learn that children and adults are going to be separated, and Johan is nervous. When they get to the kids place they discover the kids are friendly. Johan decides to tell Zack his secret.\nZack is angry at Johan for endangering them all. He reveals that he knows Johan has a crush on Mira, and he was working hard to beat Johan. The two of them spot the man on the cross and go to investigate. Back at the kids section Mira discovers the kids are psychopaths who like killing cockroaches. They invite her to play the game and try to force feed her cockroaches.\nEpisode 135\nThey worked together untying the person on the cross and it was later revealed he was a reporter that wanted to write an article about the illicit dog cult. Zack goes back to save Mira and Johan is impressed by his fighting skill. The reporter tells them to meet him when they save their friend, but instead they go to the priest to warn him about the cult. The reporter is shocked to see they brought the priest, because he is the leader of the cult.\nThe priest seized this opportunity as soon as they were about to escape by grabbing Mira, then calling out his guard dogs leaving Zack and Johan greatly outnumbered. The reporter ran away from the scene leaving the three back into the camp. Johan and his friends were all locked inside dog cages forced to watch the sacrifice while the priest. Johan's mother (with her poor eyesight) regained her sanity after seeing Johan in the cage with her poor vision. The priest caught Johan's mother after she unlocked the cage commanding his disciples to use her as sacrifice for the dog gods.\nEpisode 136\nThe priest unlocked the cage Mira was inside and dragged her by the hair into the warehouse. The main worshipper took Zack and Johan out of the cages with their hands tied to watch the sacrifice up close. The disciples gathered around Johan's mother with stones and began chucking them at her, but before any rock landed on her, Johan directed the rocks away from his mother with quick jabs he learned from Zack.\nJohan's hands were pouring out blood and it was revealed he got out of his handmade handcuffs by repeatedly grinding it against his skin peeling it in the process in order to slip out of them. Zack is not surprised by Johan's skill, because he was always jealous of Johan's boxing skill.\nEpisode 137\nJohan rescued his mother from her being bound on the cross and went with Zack to save Mira. Cutaways ensued showing that the priest used hallucinogens to convince Johan's mother to convert herself away from Christianity. Johan and Zack fought their way towards Mira. However, the priest was guarded by his dogs and had a bucket of meat to coax his dogs. Since Johan and Zack were stuck at an impasse, they were hesitant. Mira then bit the priest in the leg buying enough time for Johan's mother to suddenly douse the priest in a concoction that lured his dogs to eating him alive.\nThe reporter from earlier called in the police and took over the case. Zack comforts Mira and Johan's mother was taken to a rehabilitation center leaving Johan alone once more. Afterwards he goes missing only to show up during the boxing completion that Zack was also participating in.\nEpisode 138\nJohan rushes at Zack with speed and Zack dodges, stunning the crowd. Zack reveals he joined the competition so he can confess to Mira when he wins. However, he is beaten badly by Johan, who also decides to humiliate him by offering help after the match. Mira tries to catch up to Johan until she overhears him telling Gun that he has no friends. Hurt by this, she stops chasing him and Johan disappears with Eden.\nLater, Mira smiles as Zack practices boxing. She initially disliked Zack because he changed into a bully after losing the boxing match, and he had no goals. Seeing Zack's return towards boxing made her happy again.\nCookie 1\nZack jogging through the neighborhood. He runs into fat\nDaniel\nand\nVasco\nand observes Daniel copying his moves. He is shocked to see another copycat like Johan.\nCookie 2\nJohan getting his hair cut from his mother and pretending to be Zack. He leaves her a large check and after that is seen walking with\u00a0Gun\u00a0vowing to take his place. He is now the head of God Dog and he is obsessed with making money.\nCookie 3\nCrystal\nin her attractive body is sitting in her bathtub. She is thinking about the possibility of Daniel having two bodies and says that she would get to the bottom of it.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "personality": "On the outside, the cult leader presents himself as a kind father-like figure to Johan and listens to other people's problems, acting as their savior.\nIn reality, he is a manipulative psychopath who has brainwashed and drugged multiple people, making them join his cult. He has absolutely no morals as he is not above scamming children and disabled people for his own gain, even taking enjoyment in these cruel acts. He feels no empathy for Johan, despite knowing his tragic reality, even smiling sadistically at manipulating his mother. He was also willing to cut off his hands and feet and locking him in his dog house. He is also very perverted, seeing as he stalked then later attempted to rape Mira, a middle schooler. When his rule is threatened, he reverts to a temper tantrum state, screaming that he is god. It is unknown if he genuinely believes he is god or is attempting to lie.\nFurthermore, he is willing to fake a disability in order to get what he wants as shown when he becomes homeless and tries to get food.\nHe seemingly has an obsession with dogs, believing they are the key to godhood. He uses dogs to attack any unwanted intruders. He claims this is because they obey his every command when in actuality, he uses meat to control them",
        "relationships": "Johan Seong\nJohan looked up to the cult leader and would seek advice from him in a fatherly way. While the cult leader seemed to care for Johan, this was all a facade to hide his true nature from him as he would show no remorse in trying to kill him after manipulating him into his cult, which he tried to save his mom from.\nJohan's mother\nLike Johan, he seemed to be an ally to her. However, this was a facade to manipulate her into his cult. He shows no remorse over calling her a blind bitch and attacking her.\nMira Kim\nHe had a shameless pedophilic attraction to Mira with heavy implications he tried to rape her.",
        "synopsis": "Backstory\nThe cult leader appears in Johan's backstory. He used to attend\nJohan's\nchurch but since then has started a cult, which he called the Church of Eden. Johan would often confide in him about his issues, and he agreed to accompany\nJohan's mother\nto his cult.\nThe cult leader used his charm to get people to join his church. He fed off their insecurities and promised them salvation if they listened to his every word, because he was their 'messiah'. He used drugs (which he likely brought from\nVivi\nor her affiliates from\nWorkers 3rd Affiliate\n) to make them susceptible to his influence. He trained his followers to worship dogs, which he controlled using scented liquids. If his followers disobeyed him they were either tortured or killed.\nThe cult leader tries to get Johan's mother to join his cult but she stopped when she realized her son was in danger. He attempted to stone her to death but Johan saved his mother. The cult leader also tried to rape\nMira\n, but he was stopped by Johan's mother who instigated his dogs to attack him. The cult leader was eventually arrested and became homeless, making money using disability scams. Later, he got beat up and mugged by a group of\nHostel\nthugs.",

As the ambulance takes him away he struggles to catch it but is not fast enough. He tries to smash his head in to wake up but only knocks himself out in the snow.\nJiho\nis interrogated by the police and begins to panic. The detective mentions that if Daniel and\nJames\ndo not wake up he will have to wait for answers. Jiho begins to hope that Daniel and James don't wake up, and the detective notices the bruises on his face.\nAt the convenience store,\nZoe\nwaits for Daniel and wonders why he isn't there for the first snow.\nEpisode 173\nDaniel is dreaming that he is back in school, and his second body is hanging out with his friends. His friends don't recognize his old self and leave him behind. As he pleads for them to come back his handsome body gives him a devilish smile. Daniel wakes up to find out he was dreaming, and not in his second body.\nDaniel finds his body in the hospital comatose and the police struggle to identify him. They are worried about Daniel and believe James was the perpetrator of the incident. The detective interrogates Jiho about the pocket knife and he starts to panic.\nThe police call\nDaniel's mother\nand tell her about the incident. She gives Daniel a hug and a policeman is confused. He calls the detective to tell him there are two Daniels in J High.\nNotes\nIn South Korea, there is a belief that confessing your love in the first snow of winter will grant the relationship longevity and good luck. That may be the reason Zoe is waiting for Daniel.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

Don't worry, it's all over.\"\n\u201d\n\u2014 Daniel Park reassuring\nZoe Park\n,\nEp. 198\nDaniel Park\n(\ubc15\ud615\uc11d Park Hyung-Seok)\nis the main protagonist of\nLookism\n. He grew up in a poor single-parent household and was bullied for being severely obese. Unable to endure the bullying any longer, he moved to central Seoul, where he suddenly found himself in a second handsome body. Capable of transferring his consciousness between two bodies, he begins living a double life\u2014an ideal school life in his new body and a mundane existence as a convenience store clerk in his original one.\nHis Alternative Body would eventually lead him into the underworld of Seoul's Generations. Disturbed by the amount of unchecked injustice, Daniel would take it upon himself to fight back and stop their illegal activities. He would get into many gang fights all around Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the\nFour Major Crews\n,\n1st Generation Kings\n,\nHNH Company\n, and\nWorkers\n.\nCurrently, he is a student at\nJ High School\n's Fashion Department and the head of\nAllied\n\u2014his current goal is to stop\nJames Lee\nand\nKitae Kim\nfrom starting another generation of war.",
        "appearance": "Daniel has two bodies. His original body used to be short and overweight, now he's a lot more handsome, tall and muscular, and his second body is of tall height, thin and handsome and stated to be the perfect body.\nFirst Body\nIn his original body, Daniel is usually bespectacled, and short to the point only\nDuke Pyeon\nand\nCrystal Choi\n's original body near his height. Daniel is extremely overweight, which is why Logan calls him \"Pikachu\" (Dog in the anime).\nDaniel's first body is deemed unattractive by most, if not all, the exceptions being Crystal and Zoe. In this body, he's exposed to the true nature of society. Daniel uses this body at night to work part-time at a local mini mart, which is why it's usually seen in his work uniform.\nDespite the difference in weight and height, his first body gradually begins to resemble his second. After his fight with\nLogan Lee\nand the incident involving the homeless man who broke his glasses, Daniel's face is more striking, and he's noticeably taller and slimmer, measuring up slightly taller than\nZoe\nin height. After intense dieting and training with Sophia, he loses over a hundred pounds, so his original body is practically identical to his second body, though it is shorter. After Gun's training, Daniel has grown very tall; nearing his second body in height. Daniel has also put on more muscle mass, making him look more defined, he looks really similar to his second body in chapter (424). His face looks quite identical to the second body as well. It was stated that he resembles a younger Jinyoung Park, and even his grandmother confused him as Jinyoung Park.\nSecond Body\nDaniel Park first see's his second body\nIn his second body, Daniel has no glasses and he's taller. He has a healthy, athletic build and more physically attractive. This being his most notable trait, usually leaving women infatuated and men intimidated. Daniel's good looks make people think he is a famous model, idol, or star (which he eventually becomes) as they go so far as to ask for his autographs and pictures with him, much to his shock.\nNo one has ever been stated to surpass Daniel's good looks, and no one retains the center of attention as he does (albeit unintentionally), as a result, his second body is the most popular student at J High. He uses this body to attend school and it's usually seen in his school uniform, unless elsewhere.",
        "personality": "Daniel is a very kind and friendly person at heart, preferring to avoid unnecessary conflicts if he can, but will help those in need even in dangerous situations.\nInitially, due to being bullied, Daniel would take out his anger on his mom. However, he began to realize just how much she sacrificed for his sake, filling him with deep feelings of self-loathing and regret for his actions towards his mother to the point of vowing to be a better person. He often cries whenever he is reminded of how he treated her, such as when in his second body, he was asked to act out a certain role as a test to see his acting skills only for Daniel to cry while reading the script as the part was similar to a part of his life, he regretted the most. So as to not trouble his mother financially, Daniel is very humble and responsible as he does not bother with materialistic things unless they cut down on his or his mom's living expenses (e.g., rice cooker) and is willing to work so he can pay his own living expenses.\nDaniel is also very sympathetic and protective of those mistreated, either because of their lack of strength or because of how unattractive they are, as he can relate to how both feel and is prone to stand up for them. Though it is implied in the Runaway fam arc he is respectful enough to not interfere in other affairs without permission.\nLack of self-confidence is often Daniel's biggest hindrance slowing his progress on his goal of trying to be a better person. In some cases, it leads to his being perceived as a pushover who is nothing but a coward. Fortunately, Daniel is constantly inspired by those who diligently work towards their goals, such as Euntae and Duke and is motivated to put more effort into overcoming his struggles to achieve his goals.\nDue to his lack of social interaction with people around him prior to having his second body, he can be naive, much like Euntae, and is unsure how to act when placed under peer pressure. Likewise, he is easily deceived by perceived kindness. For example, he once accidentally agreed to become a host in a club and escaped the club while drunk. Moreover, he thought that Yui genuinely liked him for who he is while in his second body but was shocked when she treated him cruelly while he was in his original body. He also never smoked or intentionally drank before and didn't know how to refuse when putting under pressure to do so. However, this tends to create humorous situations and misunderstandings about him.\nAfter temporarily losing his connection with his current body and being helplessly bullied by Logan Daniel regressed back into his old self before moving to Seoul. But after realizing that this world wasn't fair and how he needs to work harder to overcome that unfairness Daniel gets a way better appreciation for his old body and becomes more confident in it.\nDaniel tends to become belligerent, overconfident, and apologetic when drunk.\n[\n3\n]\nIn later arcs he is seen to also have an aggressive personality when in a tense battle.",
        "history": "Daniel was raised by a single mom, and they lived in poverty. In addition to his poor living conditions, Daniel was looked down upon due to his appearance, leading him to be bullied at school (mostly by Logan). No longer willing to put up with the bullying, Daniel's mother offered him a chance to transfer to a different school (Jae Won High). Daniel, unable to bear with his school troubles any longer, tearfully accepted.\nUpon moving, Daniel's dreams of starting anew were quickly shattered by a humiliating defeat at the hands of\nZack Lee\n, captured on video. With the video going viral, he cried himself to sleep only to awaken the next morning in a completely new body. He discovered the following rules:\nHe has to sleep to change bodies\nIf one body is forcefully awakened, the other body will go to sleep.\nThe sleeping body has to be cared for like an actual body.\nHe is conscious at all times (cannot have dreams).\nIn a state of lost consciousness, he cannot change bodies until the other body recovers consciousness.\nThe sleeping body experiences all physiological phenomena normal bodies do.",
        "fighting_prowess": "See article:\nCopy Technique\nSeoul, the land where monsters fight- he commands those monsters, a genius no one can defy. He is someone who rose from the bottom- the head of Allied.\nDaniel is actually a natural-born fighter despite his lack of confidence and any formal training prior. Regardless of which body he is in, Daniel can memorize any technique down to its textbook mechanics after seeing it once and execute it with the same amount of competency as a skilled expert. In addition to this skill, he possesses incredible foresight in a fight, able to clearly see all attacks his opponents throw at him. Whether or not he is able to dodge the said attacks usually depends on his opponent and Daniel's current body. Daniels' ability to copy other people's techniques is so amazing that to others who fought Daniel felt like they were fighting themselves. Later on it was stated that Daniel\u2019s ability to copy others Techniques were far superior to Johan Seong(Another copy cat genius) stating that Johan only imitates others while Daniel is the real deal (which correlates with him being as competent as a Skilled master in that martial art or field) In the more recent chapters whenever he copies a character his hair or physical appearance turns similar to them.Further his fighting senses were so accute that he was able to catch Gun (while in trainning) and DJ offguard while fighting them which proved his calm and levelheaded attitude even in strenuous situations. According to Gun, Daniel has the eyes to figure out his out his opponent, but he isnt able to use it to its full strength. If he focuses, he can see more. During Busan arc his copy ability in second body further developed and he could copy others move effortlessly but during his fight with Jinrang when he copied the moves of his opponent along with the techniques and moves of other kings he could copy them easily but couldn't genrate the same power .Jinrang mentioned that he could copy the moves but he could never copy the intents or its force due to not understanding its significance and hardwork required to develop them thus the power of those techniques were weak.\nOriginal Body\nDaniel's old body\nWhile not on par with his second body, his weight does add an incredible amount momentum to his attacks unleashing them with such surprising force that he even forced Euntae (who possesses unbelievable strength) to resort to knocking him out when he felt he could no longer withstand his punches. He rarely ever fights in this body due to his lack of confidence while using it, but as the series progresses, he does become a more capable fighter, especially under\nVasco\n's strict workouts and guidance despite him not being aware of it. In this body, he severely lacks the desired reflexes he gains in his second body. Despite being able to see the attacks (even once commented on how slow they were), he was still not able to physically dodge them due to this body's lack of agility and reflexes. It should be noted that if attacks are executed by non-skilled practitioners, even in this body, he has no problems defending against them. Despite its many shortcomings Daniel's first body still has impressive strength and endurance as he managed to take and multiple hits from Logan Lee and recover from the experience with no lasting injuries. even\nchairman hong\nwas surprised that daniel took an attack from\nsophia\nand survived while most can not. With enough determination, his fat body could take out a person with little or no fighting experience.\nDaniel trained his body becoming unrecognizable to most people in this new form looking closer to his second body than his first, even\nZoe Park\nand\nLogan Lee\ndid not recognize him as the transformation was extreme. The weaknesses his body had are now gone as his body is faster with the addition of Systema. he has high tolerance to drugs that the drugs that were in the cookies were ineffective. Later on, he is trained by Gun as a potential successor, making him a far more fearsome fighter, he is shown to easily beat a Workers Executive and even throw Xiaolung, who is known for being a powerful opponent to many. He is also seen countering Yuseong's attack by blocking his fist and using the other leg to kick him into the ground. He has gotten so strong to the point where Eugene even compares him to a First Generation King.\nOriginal body after training (Episode 411)\nIn chapter 438, he was able to use \"\nSelf-Hatred\n\" mode in his Original Body just like his Second Body.\nIn chapter 439, Daniel was barely able to copy the moves of James Lee, but he was not as fast as him. Jichang praised his strength and said he understood why seokdu lost and why taesoo got fired up. This may imply Daniel was on the level of Taesoo or Seokdu.\nIn Chapter 439, Gun Taught him about Subconsciousness by choking Daniel on the neck and gains an ability to use\nUltra Instinct\nagain just like his Second Body.\nIn the current arc as of chapter 453 it is known that he can take on someone on the level of Jichang Kwak (being superior to the same only when using the Ultra Instinct), who himself is stated that brute strength wise is on par with Gun Park (stated by Daniel Park himself), and Jichang Kwak was someone that even Elite (Charles Choi) was interested in becoming his bodyguard before he took Jichang's life.\nIt is also shown in the recent chapter that Gun mentioned that Daniel's copy ability was inefficent in his old body  earlier as he could not generate the same power while executing the techniques that he copied, but after his training with Gun his body became strong to such level that Gun mentioned that he could now easily imitate all the moves of Gen 1 Kings almost perfecly (including\nTaesoo Ma's Fist techniques\n).\nIn the recent chapter he copied\nKwak Jinchang's\nHand Edge Technique\nperfectly while fighting Logan Lee and pulverised him thus defeating him easily.\nWhen he used Ultra Instinct against his second body, it was stated that he and his second body was moving so fast that not even Warren could keep up. If Vasco, Warren and Jerry steped in the fight, they would die. He and his second body were using every fighting technique under they experienced so far, and given that they had the same movements and techniques, they could be mistaken as the same person. However, little Daniel was being pushed back due to the experience gap between the two bodies.\nAccording to Gun Park, His ultra instinct (along with his second body) is fundamentally different from his. With Ultra instinct, he fights efficiently by adjusting to his opponent's combat power. He is mechanical with his counterattacks by returning an attack equal to the one he received. However, he does not have control over it. Due to that , when receiving the same attack the second time, he will give the same response each time.Futher in comparison to his perfect body he was inefficient in perfecting the power of the used  techniques\nGun Park mentioned that Daniel Park was his greatest masterpiece he ever created .\nSecond Body\nSecond body in UI mode\nIn this body, Daniel is among the strongest in the entire series. Even before he developed his technique and skill, he was able to defeat most opponents, solely relying on reflexes and instinct and is one of the few characters to naturally be on the level of skilled fighters with no prior formal training, the other being Johan. This, coupled with Daniel's ability to instantly replicate any fighting skill he sees just once, makes him one of the series' most formidable fighters by outdoing many others with their own fighting techniques.\nIt seems Daniel has become used to his abilities and immense fighting prowess in this body, able to dodge attacks merely on reflex with extreme ease, even while in deep thought. In some fights, he has found some attacks to be annoying.\nHis biggest testament to his fighting prowess is being one of the only people (the other being Euntae) that Jong Gun, a fighter of legendary status, acknowledges even once. Gun stated that, although Crystal was heading for a dangerous situation, if she is accompanied by Daniel and Euntae, then she's not in any real danger. However, he is not yet on the level of Jong Gun or Joon Goo, as he was easily defeated by Gun but in his UI state he fought a contolled UI Gun Park on equal footing in his hideout. Meanwhile, Euntae, his fighting equal, was soundly defeated by Jake Kim, who Gun promptly defeated.\nSo far Daniel's biggest weakness is that his compassion can often lead to unfair or synchronized fighters like Chuck Kwak and Justin Peng to overwhelm him. He also can't copy the determination that comes from the moves he copies, which makes opponents like Zack hard to fight.\nDaniel's last trick is when he enters a state known as \"Ultra-Instinct,\" in which he is rendered in a state between conscious and unconscious. He is able to maximize his fighting potential by utilizing every single move of his knowledge without hesitation. In this state he is so powerful that he is able to suppress Jerry Kwon and even able to break one of Gun's arms in their one-on-one fight. He was able to defeat 2 Crew Head (Jake Kim and Samuel Seo) simultaneously. He then proceeded to easily defeat Jerry Kwon and Lineman. After that, he completely dominated a raged Johan Seong in their fight. Although, he was not able to defeat Goo because he suddenly passed out, he still inflicted a huge damage on him. The downside of this state is that he is unable to control himself, making it difficult to discern between friends and foes.\nIn chapter 467, Gun has stated that Ultra Instinct was able to control (Gun Park can control UI) and the one who can control it can \"adjust\" their strength whatever they want. The one who aren't able to control UI will \"adjust\" their strength based on the opponents. For example, if the opponent is weak, UI will adjust its strength being weak for that opponent. If the opponent is strong, UI will just adjust its strength being strong for that opponent.\nWhile he and his real body had the same techniques and movements, Warren states that Big Daniel had more experience using those techniques. Its as if he has more practiced and that little daniel was simply copying him.\nIn chapter 470\nJinyoung Park\nsaid that Daniels strength is on the level of the ones whom the\nGapryong fist\nwas fighting against and he is way past the level of the 2nd and 1st generation and also said the he wanted to see Daniel and Gapryong in a fight this implies that he is around the level of\nGapryong Kim.\nAccording to DG, Daniel and Gun share ultra instinct, but their fighting styles are different (possibly due to having different bloodlines). With Ultra instinct, he is more like a cool-headed machine. He uses sophisticated techniques to maximize his efficiency like a perfect weapon.which was a flaw as even an injured Gun Park defeated him in his Ulta Instincrt staye mentioning that until he controls it he couldn't kill Gun Park.\nDruing his fight with Jangyeon Na he fought with a higher intensity owing to his training with Shiro Oni, he used  his Heat mode and Yamazaki Kyokushin Karate to overpowering King of Incheon shocking him and other spectators equally.\nMartial Arts Copied by his Bodies and used currently:\nBoxing\nBig Daniel copying\nZack's\nboxing (Chapter 272)\nJerry\nnotes Big Daniel's form and posture are perfect (Chapter 274)\nMuay Thai\nUI Big Daniel using Muay Thai vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nBig Daniel copying\nGabriel Park\n(Chapter 295)\nKyokushin Karate\nBig Daniel using Karate vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel using Karate vs\nZack\n(Chapter 271)\nLittle Daniel using Karate vs\nYuseong\n(Chapter 425)\nTaekwondo\nBig Daniel uses Taekwondo vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nBig Daniel using the Axe Kick vs\nSamuel\nand\nJake\nSystema\nBig Daniel using Systema vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nSophia-Style Systema\nLittle Daniel using\nSophia\n's Systema vs\nXiaolong\n(Chapter 326)\nWrestling\nBig Daniel using Wrestling vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel using Wrestling vs\nJerry\n(Chapter 274)\nCapoeira\nBig Daniel uses Capoeira vs\nJohan\n(Chapter 343)\nBig Daniel uses Capoeira vs\nGun\ndespite never seeing it at the time (Chapter 286)\nMMA\nAs Daniel knows a lot of martial arts, he can effectively mix them.\nAikido\nLittle Daniel using Aikido on\nXiaolong\n(Chapter 424)\nLittle Daniel copies\nGun's\nAikido (Chapter 397)\nInvisible Attack (IA)\nLittle Daniel copying\nJames Lee\nvs\nJichang Kwak\n(Chapter 439)\n(While he himself doesn't have the speed for it to be truly invisible and on the level of\nSinu\n,\nJames\nand\nElite's\nwhen it comes to speed with the attack, but he has copied the concept)\nKwak Jinchang's Hand Blade Technique\nLittle Daniel copying\nJichang's\nHand Blade (Chapter 460)\nBig Daniel copying\nJichang's\nHand Blade (Chapter 544)\nInnate Strength (\nKitae Kim\n)\nBig Daniel supposedly copying what seems to be\nKitae Kim\n(Chapter 468)\nWhile watching the fight,\nWarren\nclaims that what Big Daniel is copying isn't a martial art, just Innate Strength.

You're the real me.\"\n[\n5\n]\n\"You were right about one thing. I want to make a lot of money and I have a lot of things that I want to protect. But if I have to abandon what I wanted to protect to get that power, what good would that do? In the end, you'll be left on your own.\"\n[\n6\n]\n\"A lot happened. The illegal lottery tickets and the fake bank accounts... so many of my friends got involved. A lot of them got hurt and one of them even went to prison. And it turns out those four crews were behind everything. I will not sit idly by and do nothing anymore. Fighting might not be the solution to everything. But I want to protect my friends.\"\n[\n6\n]\nTrivia\nDaniel is based off\nTaejoon Park\n\u2019s\nYounger Brother\nHyungseok\nanother Ulzzang whom he is also named after in the original Korean version.\nWhenever Daniel gets drunk, he becomes very aggressive, cynical, and angry. He also gets stronger; at one point, he was able to crush a phone into pieces with one hand.\nHe bears a lot of resemblance to\nYu Narukami\nin the first chapters of Lookism. In that, the two of them wear similar hairstyles and personalities to one another.\nHe has a beautiful singing voice, as seen in the\nFestival Arc\nin both the manhwa and anime, everyone was in awe hearing his performance alongside Duke.\nFurthermore, his singing voice was given life by Hwang Chang young for the anime song \"Fly Up\".\nDue to his handsome and athletic looks, he becomes the most popular guy at his school.\nDaniel's Japanese name\nKeisuke\nmeans \"firefly\" (\u86cd) (\nkei\n) and \"help, assist\" (\u4ecb) (\nsuke\n). Keisuke's surname\nHasegawa\nmeans \"long, chief, boss\" (\u9577) (\nha\n), \"valley\" (\u8c37) (\nse\n) and \"river, stream\" (\u5ddd) (\nkawa\n/\ngawa\n).\nIn Korean, it literally translates to a Night, Mold seat (it also refers to him changing bodies at night and morning)\nHe experiences the lookism (discrimination against people of certain looks)\nOld body:\n160cm\nto over 170 cm (\nMuch\n[\n7\n]\ntaller than\n[\n8\n]\nZoe Park\nand\n[\n8\n]\nalso\n[\n8\n]\nCrystal Choi\n) to Unknown (much taller after being trained by Gun; estimated between 5'9 to 5'11)\nSecond body: The official Japanese game information itself stated the height is\n182cm\n[\n9\n]\n; originally, it was guess around\n181cm or 182cm\n[\n10\n]\n. Some guess the height is probably higher now, around 188 cm, after being shown to be taller than Zack Lee in\nmultiple\n[\n11\n]\npanels from growing like Zack.\nAccording to\nGun\n, when Daniel (original body) goes into his ultra instinct mode he is able to defeat a First Generation King.\nTom Lee\nhas seen Daniel\u2019s wiener on both his bodies.\nYeonwoo Kim\nrevealed in Cheonliang that\nJinyeong Park\nwas Daniel's uncle.\nThe people who know that Daniel have 2 bodies is Charles Choi, Diego Kang and Jinyeong Park.\nReferences\n\u2191\nQuestism, Episode 174\n\u2191\nIn\nEpisode 4\nit is stated to be September and Daniel's birthday is in\nEpisode 20\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 78\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 2\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 198: Daniel Awakens\n\u2191\n6.0\n6.1\nEp. 212: God Dog (Finale)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 250\n\u2191\n8.0\n8.1\n8.2\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 251\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nEp. 4\n\u2191\nEp. 353"

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nFamily:\nDaniel's grandma\nDaniel's mother\nAt first, when Daniel was being bullied, he blamed his mother for everything. However, as the story progresses, he begins to appreciate everything his mother has done for him.\nDavid\n(cousin)\nDylan\n(cousin)\nSarah\n(cousin)\nJinyoung Park\n(Maternal Uncle)\nJinyoung Park is the only one apart from Charles Choi and James Lee to know about Daniel's two bodies. In chapter 439 and 440 ,\nBakgu Noh\ncalls Daniel as young master and tells him that he looks exactly like Jinyoung Park when he was young and tells\nJichang Kwak\nnot to put ' his' blood line in jeopardy. With this we know that he is related to jinyoung park in a way.After the cheonling arc we find out that Jinyoung Park is actually Daniel's Mother's younger brother.\nDaniel's Old School:\nHyeji\nHyeji's boyfriend\nLogan Lee\nMae Kim\nJ High School:\nCrystal Choi\nCrystal liked the original Daniel, despite them seeming to despise each other mutually whenever they met in their new body, both having slight prejudice against people with an attractive exterior. However, as the plot progressed, the negative feelings between the two seemed to subside, especially during the Stalker Arc. She won the auction for a date with him in her second body, yet she never went on a date with him. Crystal has shown to be suspicious of Daniel's second body and attempts to investigate, but has not found any concrete evidence.\nHowever as the plot progressed, despite Crystal's original body appearences was reduced,  it is left ambiguous if Daniel has abandoned any feelings for the original Crystal.\nDoo Lee\nDuke Pyeon\nDaniel respects Duke for his commitment to music despite receiving a lot of hardship for his appearance. Duke reminds Daniel of what he could be if he tries harder. He is the one who helped Duke get into PTJ and supports him by watching him and appearing as a guest on his channel from time to time.\nEli Jang\nGordon Park\nHan Park\nJay Hong\nJay is Daniel's best friend. The two are refered to and shown to be very close multiple times throughout the episodes, as Jay appears to be deeply caring for Daniel's wellness. Indeed, Jay is often shown doing nice things for Daniel, without him realizing it most of the time (buying him thousand of dollars worth of clothes, giving Daniel very expensive schoolbooks for him to study with, involving himself in fights for Daniel even though Jay hates fighting, etc). Jay even has pictures of Daniel on his phone and wallet, and becomes quite panicked if he looses them. Their bond is also demonstrated through the fact that Daniel is one of the only persons who can understand him, as Jay is only ever seen in the webtoon speaking in dots.\nJace Park\nJace Is The Best All Time Friend Of Vasco They Both Were Bullied By Seniors Of Their School They Faced Torture With Bravery Some Anime Characters Don Like Jace Because His Ears Are Very Large That Make Him Look Like An Ugly Man\nJoy Hong\nJiho Park\nKay Jang\nKouji\nMira Kim\nVasco\nVasco is one of Daniel's inspirations to begin working out in his old body. He admires the dedication Vasco has in improving himself and the loyalty that the Burn Knuckles have towards him. Vasco is one of the first people in the story to call Daniel a friend, and encourages Daniel to constantly improve himself.\nVin Jin\nYui Kim\nZack Lee\nZoe Park\nWhen Daniel transferred to J High School, she immediately started flirting with him. In fact, she was the first girl to have ever flirted with him. Although Zoe at first didn't respect Daniel in his original body, she began falling in love with the original Daniel after he saved her from an internet stalker, which seemed to confuse her because she still has a crush on the new Daniel.\nAllies\nJake Kim\n\"Seoul, The Land where Monsters fight. He commands those Monsters. He is a Genius no one can deny. Someone who rose from the Bottom.\nHe's the Head of Allied.\n\"\n- Jake Kim warning Yujae Seon about Daniel Park Ch.563\nJames Lee (DG)\nJames is the only one, alongside Charles Choi and Jinyoung Park, that knows about Daniel's two bodies.\nSteve Hong\nDaniel and Steve are allies, with a goal to investigate\nCharles Choi\n.\nOthers\nCharles Choi\nGun Park\nGun Park is one of the first people to recognise Daniel's talent of copying fighting skills and techniques. In chapter 285 & 286 where Daniel and Gun fought, Daniel broke Gun's arm, he acknowledged Daniel and said that he'll help him destroy the 4 major crews.\nWhen Daniel second body was caught by the workers Daniel came to Gun asking to be taught how to fight and become stronger. Gun takes him and trains him in a junkyard for a month and Gun calls him his masterpiece."

He moved to a new house and got into a fight with Zack Lee in his old body. He cried himself to sleep, but when he woke up he saw he had a new body, which was handsome and strong.\n[\n2\n]\nDaniel decided to go to school in his new body and work at a convenience store in his old one. He quickly gained popularity for his looks, and boys became jealous of him. He beat both Zack and Vasco in a fight, and became enemies with the Burn Knuckles before Vasco changed his mind about him. Zack used to bully him as well, until he learned about Daniel's struggles. During his time in school he made friends with Zoe, Jiho, Duke, and Jay, who became his best friend.\nA few months in school there was a transfer student named Crystal Choi, who many people thought was unattractive. Daniel fell in love with her, and she fell in love with his actual body. However, neither of them knew that they both had two bodies. When Crystal and Daniel met for a second time, they resented each other because each thought the other was arrogant. They took turns taking care of the lost dog Enu before Daniel adopted her and gave her puppies to Jay.\nDG became interested in Daniel when he heard about him from Gun. He told Daniel that he could tell him the secret of his bodies if he united the four crews. Daniel came across Johan Seong, the leader of the God Dogs, and they became friends. When Jiho got scammed by the God Dogs, Daniel offered to help get his bank account back. He even helped save Jiho from James Gong, but Jiho became jealous of Daniel and pushed the two of them out of a window, making Daniel's second body enter a coma.\nWhile trying to learn about his secret, he ran into Crystal's father, who told him he had to surpass DG to learn about his secret. Logan Lee had also began bullying Daniel in his old body, and forcing him to woo Zoe for him. Daniel became overwhelmed and decided to run away and become homeless for some time. He eventually returned to find out Logan was sexually harassing Zoe. He fought Logan in his old body, and was able to get his second body back.\nDaniel returned to school and met up with Johan, who offered him a position in the God Dogs. He refused, and made a promise to destroy all four gangs. He later became interested in Hostel when he learned they were using pictures of girls to sell perverted items. He infiltrated Hostel and managed to save some girls from prostitution scams. While Jace and Johan were busy fighting Hostel, Daniel and his friends went on a trip to Cheongliang and met up with members of Vin's old gang who wanted revenge on him.\nDaniel returned to school when he learned Jasmine was missing again. He found her after Zack, who told him he could not take her home. When Zack refused to tell him why, Daniel assumed he was being unreasonable and decided to fight him.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 1\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 2",

        "appearance": "Darius is a tall man, as he is visibly much taller than\nEli\nwhen standing in front of him. Darius has a muscular structure, with well-built legs that are thin in comparison to his broad shoulders and large biceps. On his left arm is a sleeve of tattoos, some colored. He has rather messy, black hair with the sides cut short, and prominent sideburns. He is normally seen with a smirk or disturbed expression.\nIn\nJuvenile Prison Arc\n, he wears the prison uniform with a yellow name tag. Outside of juvenile prison, he wears a black sleeveless shirt, blue pants, painted nails, and a necklace with a bow.",
        "personality": "He is somewhat flirtatious in nature, and is rather feminine since he has a bow chain necklace and blue nails and because he tends to sugarcoat words in ways to make his words seem innocent when fighting, such as calling people \u201csugar cake\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cake\u201d.",

        "synopsis": "Juvenile Prison Arc\nHe meets Jiho in the prison cell, and they are the only ones who have yellow tags standing for violent crimes. Jiho threatens him, by Darius is not amused. Darius makes Jiho's life miserable, by forcing him to clean the toilet, sleep in the coldest spot, and beating him up.\n[\n1\n]\nHe backs off of Jiho for a while after a crazy guy appears to be on his side, but once the guy no longer cares about Jiho, he torments him again.\n[\n2\n]\nIn the lunchroom, Darius tries to start a fight, until he realizes that he picked a fight with Jake Kim. He then apologizes. He lets Jake stomp his head on the ground without putting up any resistance. The guards come in and stop the fight, asking who did it, and Darius insists that he fell on the ground and that Jake wasn't involved. When leaving, Darius glares at Jiho, threatening his death.\nIn the bath, Jiho sneaks up behind Darius, determined to live.\n[\n3\n]\nHe cracks Darius' head open in a sneak attack and Daryl has a bandage on his head the next day, looking angry.\n[\n4\n]\nHis own fear was later used against him similar with Eli with Jiho grabbed ahold of his towel and wrapped his neck around it. He was then defeated once he saw Jiho's face of someone who wanted to murder him. It is then likely that he became scared of Jiho similar with the other prisoners.\nEli Jang (Arc)\nDarius is mentioned when he is calling an individual about an event that wasn't mentioned, and was claimed to be the master crew of the back door gang, then out of his way to target\nEli\n.\nIn Episode 239 however, once he reappears, he fights Eli, while he was somewhat flirting with him, calling him \u201cpretty\u201d and \"strawberry cake\". When Darius is about to \"defeat\" Eli, Eli grabs Darius' necklace and strangles him. Darius almost suffocates and he started to develop severe pnigophobia. He was later arrested for raping\nOlly Wang\n, and was placed in the same institution as\nJi Ho\n.",

He\u2019s one of the few people who knows about Daniel Park having two bodies.",
        "appearance": "DG is a physically striking individual with a slim physique and pale skin. He is known for his distinctive pink hair and dark eyes. He often wears dark sunglasses and has a tattoo on his forearm.\nWhen assuming the identity of James Lee, DG adopts a starkly different appearance. He wears an all-white outfit, including a woolen sweatshirt, and covers his face with a mask.",
        "personality": "DG is more cool and composed than most, if not all, characters in Lookism. He tends to watch and observe others silently, but when he talks, he acts quite aloof and distant, only warming up to a few people. DG is also very honest, but he doesn't talk much so it's sometimes difficult to know what he is thinking.\nHe is known to be extremely intelligent and talented. A hall of his trophies and awards were displayed in his previous school which is now abandoned, showing his expertise in various fields. Some of the awards includes him being a champion in art, poetry, golf, swimming, tennis, and many more.\nBack in the 1st generation, James was extremely ruthless. He made sure to leave a mark or reminder to each of the Kings by either incising or removing a part of their body, like\nTaesoo Ma\n's eye.",
        "fighting_prowess": "As the legend of the first generation, DG is immensely powerful and is one of the strongest fighters in the PTJ verse. Sometimes it is said he is the strongest in the verse. He single handedly took down Darius Hong and his gang with ease, showing prodigal skill in combat. It is said that he ended the\nfirst generation\n, a notorious era of well known fighters. He bested Taesoo Ma, the \"King Of Ansan\" in a fight with little to no injuries. He fights using an acrobatic style , and being incredibly quick and swift, to dodge other's attacks. His fighting style is described to be very graceful. He is also one of three users able to use\nInvisible Attacks\n, where one attacks the blindspots of an opponent so quickly, the attack seems invisible to the eye.\nIn chapter 428, he fought the J High trio and says that he will spare Big Deal and Burn Knuckles if they manage to land a single clean hit on him. Over the course of the fight, he overpowered the trio with little to no effort while keeping his left hand in his pocket.\nIn the past, James had managed to defeat and disband the\nGeneration of Circles\n(1st Gen) all by himself, and take a body part of the regional kings he had defeated, such as Taesoo's eye and Gongseob Ji's leg (with some\nexceptions\n).\nAs of chapter 463 it is shown that in the past during his fight with Gongseob Ji, James was shown an incredible technique by Gongseob called the 'Gongseob Ji Counter' where it is described to be a double edge sword as you need to have an immense desire to not fall and to win to get back up to land a devastating punch on your opponent that could potentially end the fight with your win, but it was shown that either James dodged the attack or took it head on and received no damage whatsoever. Even James wanted to learn the technique but Gongseob declined and stated he would never take on a student (which\nchanged\n) and made the stone faced sarcastic James Lee lament and sigh stating that its sad that Gongseob will have to retire and that the technique will fall with him.\nIn his fight with\nSeongji Yuk\n, he reveals that he has \"overcome the threshold\" in two areas, speed and technique, those two alone allowing him to be as legendary as he was. He also states that he isn't able to overcome another threshold because he's lacking in potential.In the later part of the battle he was able to overcome the threshold of strength against Seongji Yuk.\nQuotes\nI would love to stop making enemies, but once again I've ended up with even more of them.\n[\n2\n]\nEtymology\nThe name\nShion\nis written in hiragana (\u3057\u304a\u3093), which has no special meaning. However, when written in kanji (\u7d2b\u82d1 or \u8a69\u97f3), it could possibly mean:\n\u7d2b\u82d1 - \"\naster\n\", a plant of the daisy family that has bright rayed flowers, typically of purple or pink.\n\u8a69\u97f3 - \"poetry, poem\" (\u8a69) (\nshi\n) and \"sound\" (\u97f3) (\non\n).\nShion's surname\nIzaki\nmeans \"that one\" (\u4f0a) (\ni\n) and \"cape, peninsula\" (\u5d0e) (\nsaki\n/\nzaki\n).\nTrivia\nDG's design and name are references to\nG-Dragon\n, a real-life Kpop rapper.\nBased on the trophies previously showcased at his old school, DG excels in a variety of domains besides fighting such as art, poetry, swimming, golf and tennis.\n[\n3\n]\nDG's school's name has been shown in Episode 176 but its full name was revealed in Episode 396.\n[\n4\n]\nDG first appeared in episode 19 in a poster on student's Namsoo Lee's Wall.\nHe has an angel motif, established by his all white clothing and graceful fighting style. This contrasts with Gun Park who has a demon motif.\nIn Episode 479, people started to believe that DG is actually Charles's second body. This speculation however has been invalid as in Episode 480, DG said he had followed Charles's action on \"kidnapping\" Baek Gyul because Charles was scared that Gyul could ask Park Jin Young about his weakness.\nReferences\n\u2191\n[1]\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 427\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 176: The Truth Behind Daniel Park (03)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 396"

He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.\nDG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by\nGapryong Kim\n, who was known as the \"Legendary Fist\". The crews at this time were called \"fists\", and the crew heads were called \"bosses\", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called \"circles\". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of\nCharles Choi's\ngeniuses\n, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.\nEugene later calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.\nOne Night III\nDG goes off to find the James Lee crew and put an end to their misuse of his name. He comes to their headquarters and finds Backdoor members. He asks if they know about James Lee, and they decide to attack him and bring him to Darius. DG beats them all and walks away.\nDG then comes across Daniel and the J High crew fighting Taesoo Ma and interrupts them.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 359: James Lee (End)\n\u2191\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/ep-113-stalker-01/viewer?title_no=1049&episode_no=113\n\u2191\nThe Truth Behind Daniel Park"

Here, he helped out a captive\nDaniel Park\n, disobeying Vivi's orders to pour acid on him and bumping into the security guards at the entrance, allowing Daniel to escape. This is a pivotal point towards his character development, as he desires to have a fresh start.\nDespite all this, Doo manages to avoid trouble and gets promoted to Executive in the Workers'\nSecond Affiliate\n, due to Eugene overhearing his unique ideas that could be implemented into the fighting circus. He is next seen in the\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate) arc\n, where he was known as Hannya. Here, he seems to have built up a reputation, lying about being a tough guy who's ultimate move is the \"Dragon Fist\", even being referred to by\nRyuhei\nas\n\"..the only Korean [Ryuhei] acknowledge[s]\".\nWhile initially lashing out at Daniel for not saving him, he soon reveals key information about the circus, helping Daniel create a plan to take them down.\nDoo manages to escape following the defeat of the 2nd Affiliate. Before he leaves, he has a final encounter with Ryuhei, where he confessed that everything he told him was a lie, including the \"Dragon Fist\", and he was just a bully. Ryuhei tells him to turn over a new leaf and become a Korean worthy of his respect. This is a major turning point for Doo, who decides to take his advice to heart. Doo then boards a bus to visit his younger brother, Hyeondong Lee.\nQuotes\n\"Bring it on.

But both Daniel and Zack made excuses to get themselves out of there, much to the disappointment of Doo Lee and the girls. He, along with the two cronies and the Beauty Department girls were later caught by the camp instructors and forced to do squats as punishment.\nThe next night, Doo Lee assists Daniel, Jiho, and Zoe in searching for Mira and Zack. He suggest that they might just be hanging out and will return soon, but they keep searching regardless. Along with the police, they eventually find Zack beating up\nHeemin Kim\nafter the latter attempted to rape Mira.\nAttention Whore\nDoo Lee offers\nPark Tae Joon\nto make a video with him on Pacebook, which he accepts. He then tries to offer Daniel to join him (hoping that his looks will get them views), but Zack tells him to shut up. Tired of being told what to do, Doo Lee reminds him that he spent his own money to buy things for him and that he should be thankful. Just before they're about to fight, they are separated as Doo Lee shouts that Zack has no friends, but rather underlings who do things for him.\nIn the Pacebook video Doo Lee makes with Tae Joon, they call out the gangster Shin Dae Hoon, gaining them popularity. Tae Joon worries about the possibility that Dae Hoon will respond, but Doo Lee assures that it's all going to be alright. As they make more videos targeting Dae Hoon which gets more and more attention every time, Dae Hoon finally responds after they make fun of his mom, saying that he will find and catch them, knowing that they both go to J High.\nWorkers (4th Affiliate)\nOne Night III\nWorkers (3rd Affiliate)\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)",

However, the president took one look at him and he was immediately dismissed without him being able to perform his piece. Frustrated by the unfair rejection he proceeded to take out all his emotions and turn them into lyrics. The next day in school the students in the vocal dance department were talking about the up incoming festival and discussing on who should perform Jin Ho and someone irrelevant was chosen to perform and Duke volunteered to perform as well and for that he received all kinds of back lash. While walking down the hallway he heard Daniel singing and asked him to sing with him in the festival. During their practice Daniel noticed their similarities and realized how amazing Duke was to be able to create such wonderful lyrics despite being in his situations as well as having the courage to try even after all the rejections he has received. At the start of their performance Daniel made a mistake so Duke covered for him and showed that he had his back they did really well and all the audience were surprised and Duke finally got the recognition he deserves. At the end of the performance the president of DY approached them and gave his business card and offered a job....to Daniel who humbly declined but that did not stop Duke.\nPaprika TV Arc\nAfter his 2nd rejection from DY, Duke started to perform his rap songs in Paprika. He barely got any views at the start but steadily began to grow and people started to recognize his talent.\nMidterms Arc\nIn this arc Duke was relieved to be the top 5th person in his department so he helped tutor Daniel for the midterm exams.\nAttention Whore Arc\nDuke was briefly mentioned as one of the top three most well known paprika stars in school.\nIllegal Toto Arc\nDuke was seen discussing in a cafe about the trending illegal gambling game called Toto."

He is a student in the beauty department of\nJ High School\n,\nYenna's\nfather,\nHeather's\nlove interest and one of the three children trained by\nTom Lee\n. As well as the leader and founder of the\nHostel\n. He briefly served as the president of the\nWorkers\n\u2018 5th affiliate, before joining Hostel with Allied.",
        "appearance": "Eli Jang is considered to be attractive by many girls at J High School. He was referred to as, \"an Angel from Heaven.\"\n[\n1\n]\nHe has a tall stature and slender body frame, with pale skin and dark-colored eyes. On his back there are multiple scars including even a bullet wound he got while living on the streets. He used to wear rugged clothing when he was younger, but now he typically wears brand clothing or his school uniform.\nUp until he was 15, he had long straight black hair. During the\nEli Jang Arc\n, Heather had given him a haircut, where the sides of his head were shaved. Throughout the majority of the series, he is seen with his hair dyed blue with pink and lavender highlights, but as of the\nWorkers(3 Affiliates) Arc\n, he is revealed to have changed it to a bleached blond mullet.\n[\n2\n]\nNow as the President of Workers 5th Affiliation, Eli dyed his hair back to black.\nHe has a letter-shaped scar on the left side of his forehead from his fight with\nDarius Hong\n[\n3\n]\nthat he covered with henna and later on with an \"H\" tattoo to commemorate his time with his friends and the creation of Hostel.",
        "personality": "Eli Jang seems to be rather kind. He doesn't judge by appearance, seeing how he has a crush on Crystal's short body. This is possibly due to Crystal being similar to his dead lover, Heather. who is the mother of his daughter, Yenna. He also has a lot of self-confidence despite his terrible hair-cutting skills. He dreams to be a hairdresser when asked by Vasco what his dream is, this most likely have been influenced by\nHeather\n.\nEli Jang single-handedly defeats several members of the God Dogs.\nHe usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna; he did not protest even when some of the\nGod Dogs\ntreated him harshly, rather he apologized, seeking to end the argument peacefully.\nHe is very protective of his daughter Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he ever received. He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew.\nIn his past, Eli proved to be a very violent man as he grew up on the streets. He was willing to do just about anything to get what he wants. While he did display a very simple vocabulary he also showed to be very street smart given that he was able to come up with the idea of Hostel in the first place. However, despite his attitude, Eli only desired a family that cared for him and he is willing to do just about anything to protect and provide for them, as evidenced by him picking a fight with Gun to go see his daughter Yenna and him attacking\nJohan Seong\nfor harming his allies.",
        "fighting_prowess": "\u201c\nI'm not fighting Eli ever again. Because it felt like I'm fighting a beast.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Warren Chae about Eli Jang's fighting style\nStreet Fighting and Savagery\nEli Jang is one of the most savage and aggressive fighters shown. His upbringing on the streets with\nMister Carpenter\ncoupled with his lack of formal martial arts training cultured fighting instincts often called \"animalistic\". He was so fearsome that Gun took him as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, comparing his fighting style to his partner Goo's. Eli's fighting style can be surmised as pure efficient savagery, utilizing any-and-all attacks to finish the fight as succinctly as possible. This includes biting, groin grabbing, eye-gouging, headbutting, fiercely stomping a grounded opponent and using any weapon he can get his hands on. Interestingly, it is noted that his fighting style is a mirror copy of Tom Lee's by employees of the White Tiger Centre. His savage fighting style gets more dangerous when Eli is cornered. He uses his opponent's clothes or accessories to restrain or to inflict great damage on them as seen when he used Warren's clothing as makeshift handcuffs\n[\n4\n]\nand when he strangled Darius with his necklace.\n[\n3\n]\nAfter meeting Eli once again, Tom Lee remarked that he isn't as strong as he expected him to be and resolved to teach him everything again from scratch in order to awaken the real beast inside him. After a month of training and getting beaten up, Tom told Eli that he awakened something called the Animal Instinct, only then Tom acknowledges Eli and gives Yenna back to him.\n[\n5\n]\nPhysical Endurance\nEli has great endurance as he was able to spring back up after being hit by powerful fighters like Warren Chae and Darius Hong. He is also quite powerful as he once knocked out Johan Seong in one swing of a flute and it is implied that after training with Gun he got much stronger giving Gun the scar on his chest when the latter decided to test him. He is strong enough to defeat\nIvan Park\nand\nHope Park\n, two fighters renowned for their physical strength, with ease.\n[\n6\n]\nAikido and Weapon Use\nThanks to Gun's training, Eli now knows Aikido as a martial art and seems to have proficiency in the usage of stun batons. Gun remarked that he gave Eli a stun baton because he is too strong, metaphorically referring to that weapon as a chain to restrain Eli. His fighting method is proven to be efficient and effective as Eli could defeat singlehandedly Hostel A's mobs and Darius for the second time.\nHunt for Big Deal arc\nIn the hunt for Big Deal arc Eli became incredibly more powerful than before so much so that some underlings in Big Deal stated that Eli was overflowing with power and that\nMandeok\nsaid that he has finally became a strong man and made up for the 3 year hiatus. This is proven even further with the fact that by this time he has played a crucial role in defeating two 1st Gen kings and taking over their territory. His endurance is so great that during the fight against\nSinu Han\neven though he was bloody and beaten he still didn't fall to the ground until\nGun\nfinished the job.\nQuotes\n\"As a dad, I won't hit anyone or abandon anyone or leave anyone all alone. You're my family now. I will protect you.\"\n[\n7\n]\n\"\nI won't cry from now on. Even when sad things happen, I promise to smile.. like you told me to.\"\n[\n8\n]\n\"Yenna is not the only one that I've brought to life. I gotta be responsible for everything I give birth to because I'm a dad.\"\n[\n9\n]\n\"Who told you to wear a necklace to a fight?\"\n[\n10\n]\n\"I was curious about middle school. The uniforms... Books.. And school lunches, all that. I was curious\n.\"\n[11]\n\"You guys were right. I was short-sighted. We are Gangdong. Gangdong will protect its own.\"\n[12]\nEtymology\nJapanese\nThe name\nSatoshi\nmeans \"intelligent, clever, bright\" (\u8061).\nSatoshi's surname\nIsono\nmeans \"shore/seashore, beach\" (\u78ef) (\niso\n) and \"field, wilderness\" (\u91ce) (\nno\n).\nTrivia\nHe is the only male in the beauty department of J High School.\nHe is bad at cutting hair, yet girls want their hair cut by him anyways because he is attractive.\nJang Hyun is modeled by Aboki model Jang Hyun (same name).\nDuring the Eli Jang Arc, it showed his tragic start in life, then how he survived as a runaway at 10 years old, then finally his quest for a normal life at age 15.\nHe was Gun's favorite choice for successor.\nWhen he was younger, his hairstyle was an overgrown mullet.\nThe all-male architecture department feels jealous of him because he is always surrounded by girls.\nHe tries to always smile whenever he can because of Heather's late suggestion.\nWhen in a state of motivation (the \u201canimal instinct\u201d power-up), Eli's left eye is drawn glowing green.\nEli (like many other male characters in Lookism) is stated in a comedic manner to have a large member.\n[\n4\n]\nHe is the Author's favorite character along with Jiho Park\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 232: Eli Jang (1)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 330: Workers(3 Affiliates) (1)\n\u2191\n3.0\n3.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 239 Eli Jang (8)\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 236:Eli Jang (5)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 339: Workers(3 Affiliates) (10)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 254: Jin Jang's Analysis (3)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 242: Eli Jang (11)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 247: Eli Jang (Last Episode)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 267: Hostel (2)\n\u2191\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/ep-239-eli-jang-8/viewer?title_no=1049&episode_no=239"

He ran away when he was 10 years old and met someone he referred to as\n\"Mister Carpenter\"\nwho taught him how to survive alone on the streets and also some carpentry skills.\n[\n1\n]\nSome time afterwards he met Sally Park and her friends and decided to live in Gangdong with them. Together they formed Hostel, one of the\nBig 4 Crew\n, with Eli as their leader.\nDuring his time in Hostel, Eli fell in love with a girl named\nHeather\nand conceived a child with her. When Heather died, Eli left Hostel to take care of his daughter, Yenna, and stopped fighting. It was shown that the reason he is interested in\nCrystal Choi\n(the original body) is because she reminded him of Heather.\nUpon coming to J High, Eli became the crush of many beauty department girls, who complain that he disappears after school. The reason he avoids them is that he is very busy taking care of Yenna and working at his part-time job as a hairdresser.",
        "background": "Eli Jang was subjected to a rough upbringing with his father abusing his mother. This led to his mother running away. Eli's father remarried, with the new wife beating him severely. Eli's father died from unknown circumstances with the new wife seemingly indifferent, implying she was involved with a life-insurance fraud involving Eli's father. In either case, the new wife remarried her old husband and brought in her biological children to Eli's household.\nThe mother continued her abuse and neglect of Eli, keeping him locked away whilst the rest of the family enjoyed their new dwelling. The only memorable interaction Eli had with his family was when he played a twisted version of hide-and-seek with his mother where once the hider was found, they would be severely beaten. This game warped Eli's conception of love with him coming to enjoy the game as this was the only time his new mother would come to seek him out. The culmination of Eli's childhood was his running away at the age of 10. On the streets, he was brought up by \"Mr. Carpenter\".\nEli Jang Arc\nChapter 232\nSally finds that\na cat\nhad let itself into her house.

He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then \"he will get in big trouble\".\nAt school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.\nWarren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park.

Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.\nChapter 234\nSally tells Eli not to fight and Warren punches Eli.

Apart from planning ahead of time, he has also proven to be a quick decision-maker. Additionally, surrounding people close to the main\nJ High fighters\n, in order to corner them and manipulate them into his will.\nHe is considerably intelligent as well, not only attending a prestigious private high school, but also operating a successful business at a young age and planning other sorts of warfare within Seoul. He does a great analysis of the other characters whilst barely knowing them, perhaps from gained knowledge through affiliations, but proves his predictability with situations.\nWhenever something bad or on a desperate situation, he just slumps, seemingly broken and hopeless. He stays that way, unless his minions assist him.\nTrivia\nEugene is multilingual, being fluent in Japanese and Chinese. He is seen conversing with Neko and Ryuhei in Japanese,\n[\n6\n]\nand Xiaolung in Chinese.\nHe might be ambidextrous, as he is seen eating with both hands and writing/playing tennis with his left.\nThe assembly ranks are divided according to the badge, and in\nEpisode 299\n, there seems to be a badge that means \"President\", though Eugene's badge has not yet been revealed. It was revealed that there was a presidential badge with functions such as measuring heart rate and checking vital functions.\nEugene has access to cars such as: Chrysler 300, Rolls-Royce Phantom, and Mercedes-Benz S-class.\nIt was revealed by\nSteve Hong\nthat Eugene was part of the Ten Geniuses as a Genius of Conduct.\nReferences\n\u2191\n[1]\nEpisode 421\n\u2191\nEpisode 474\n\u2191\nEpisode 474\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 349\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 149\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 375"

Since then, Vasco and Burn Knuckles have been in numerous gang fights throughout Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the\nFour Major Crews\n,\n1st Generation Kings\n,\nHNH Company\n, and\nWorkers\n.\nCurrently, he is a student in the Architecture Department at\nJ High School\n, the leader of Burn Knuckles, and one of the founding members of\nAllied\n. His current goal is to prevent\nJames Lee\nand\nKitae Kim\nfrom starting another generation of war.",
        "appearance": "Episodes 7-366\nPTJ art style changing overtime (Episodes 7-366)\nFrom his first appearance in Episode 7, Vasco stood out as looking older than his age. His skin is fair and smooth, with a slender face and jet-black hair parted in the center. Vasco has dark, almond eyes with thin eyebrows. He has a well-toned muscular body with Japanese-style tattoos covering both arms and pectorals. Vasco, despite his slender face, grows an impressive amount of facial hair, often sporting a bushy beard and small mustache. Throughout the story, Vasco refused to wear the school's uniform, opting instead to wear various kinds of Burn Knuckles jumpsuits until the 2nd year. He always wrapped the jumpsuit shirt around his waist, along with a white undershirt. Due to his clothing choices, it's easy to mistake him for an active gangster.\nAt the time of the blind date (episodes 178-179)\nVasco doesn't care about his appearance and regularly forgets to groom. However, as seen in\nVasco's Blind Date\n, when he decides to get dressed up, he becomes a different person.\nHe turns into a pretty boy by shaving and cleverly hiding his physique with his clothes. Instead of scaring people away, his attractive appearance makes him look more younger and approachable.\nYouth\nChildhood and Middle School Days (Episodes 51-57)\nThroughout his elementary and middle school days, Vasco was underweight for his age. His arms were like sticks, and you could see his ribs from the sides. It's a big contrast from the muscular body he has now.\nHe still had the same hairstyle, and his eyes were just as narrow. He gained many vulgar scars around his body from his former bullies in middle school, his many tattoos being a way to cover them up.",
        "personality": "Even being stated by Jace, Euntae is known to have a unique personality. Although he appears to look scary and menacing, Euntae is actually very pure-hearted and innocent. He cares deeply for those who get treated in an ill manner in society and risks his own life to protect them. Euntae believes that everyone should be treated fairly and the views of respect they achieve should be based on their actions, not on their looks. Euntae is also a strong-willed person, not afraid to keep trying his best to achieve his goals.\nWhile he is a strong-minded and headstrong person, Euntae is surprisingly very sensitive and delicate whenever he is emotionally upset. Some examples are when he starts crying when girls bought other male students at the Auction but didn't want to buy him because they thought he looked too fearsome. Another moment when Euntae starts crying was when he said that people took him for a fool. Euntae is quite compassionate and appreciates the special bonds he has with his friends, especially Jace. Euntae also wants to help the less appreciated people in society become stronger so that they can defeat those who torment and oppress them.\nEuntae seems to have a strong respect for teachers and higher authorities in general. He also has respect for the mama bear that raised him in one Night arc and even says that he can't ever lose in respect to his master Brendak.\nAs the story progresses, Euntae has an increase in his desire to grow. Originally branching from an empathetic mindset, he expressed a sensibility to others situations.\n[\n3\n]\nBelieving that he should always save those who cannot fend for themselves and are weak, he ambitions to become a superhero for them, coming from his understanding of his experience in bullying and self-hatred. However, as result of his self-obsession with becoming a better person, Euntae transforms into believing anyone associated with wrongdoing is inherently bad, with no pity to understand their perspective. His mindset is revolutionized to become the 'villain' as of result. He states to Jake, \"For me to beat the bad guys, I have to become one.\"\n[\n4\n]\nFighting Techniques\nAfter doing 100 push-ups, 100 pull-ups, 100 squats and running 10 km every day for 2 years, Euntae is one of the strongest characters in the entire series. Many of the delinquents of middle school who dared challenge him were taken down from a single shoulder grab. Euntae's strength has been so overpowering, he has shown in numerous fights to simply take people out in a single move and even lift some up with a single hand. And while Euntae was unable to match with Daniel's new body, he was able to compete with him when he was drunk. Euntae is also incredibly fast as during the live streaming arc and Fake Bank account arc he is seen covering vast distances very easily.\nWhen he met up with Joon Goo once again and after doubling his already insane workout, Euntae got progressively stronger. He lifted Logan Lee with one of his legs, bent steel bars in the Picnic arc and break bones casually. After his training from Brekdak, Euntae has some training in Muay Thai.\nFinally, Euntae is known for his indomitable will power and endurance. He is willing to go through immense physical pain and never give in or surrender. His aura in fact as been noted to be terrifying to even gangsters.\nAfter training with Brekdak and the bears for a short time, Euntae's strength and endurance grew unto unbelievable levels, as he still managed to attack after getting his legs crushed by Vin Jin. Given his golden Mongkol, it is implied that he has mastered his Muay Thai training and from living in the wilderness with his bear/master, he managed to unlock a new technique called the Death Blow: a powerful punch that can send people flying.\nAfter retraining again with Brekdak for the month leading up to the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Brekdak himself stated that Vasco's physique and power is enough to take on just about anyone (but was eventually proven wrong as he couldn't handle a blow from James Lee), but that statement was holding up pretty well as the sheer force of his blows was pushing Mandeok extremely far back; Mandeok would have lost the fight as Mandeok himself thought that it is shocking that such as little body (stated by him) generated so much power.\nTechniques Used\nRunner's High\nIn the  Worker's First Affiliate arc when Euntae was fighting against Eli Jang, It was revealed that the first forbidden move of Brekdak is actually controlling a phenomenon known as\n\"Runner's High\"\nwhere a person can feel euphoria after tremendous physical activity (like\nThe Stage\nor\nMastery\n). After rigorous training, Euntae was able to control the phenomenon and his eyes become pale white and his body unlocks its peak potential. Brekdak also mentioned that when the Runner's high is controlled, all other techniques that Euntae mastered can be evolved.\nIn the second half of the fight with Eli Jang, Euntae used the 1st Forbidden skill and immediately overpowered Eli, defeating him. Eli noticed at that moment Euntae's speed, destructive power, and all other physical aspects doubled. Unlike Daniel when using\nUltra Instinct\nin his second body, he loses all control and becomes a fighting machine, Euntae maintains his sanity while using\nRunner's High.\nBy the Busan arc the power of Runner high further developed making Vasco a literal beast he fought with King of Incheon alongside Allied crew and his strikes and hits became so powerful that it made the King of Incheon take up his guard to defend against Vasco and Allied he also easily devastated the succesors of Busan crew with Vinjin and fought Jinrang without falling down.\nMuay Thai\nDeath Blow\nBrekdak's Forbidden Skills\nSkill No. 01: Hero/ The Runner's High\nSkill No. 02:\nSkill No. 03: Compressed Low Kick\nSkill No. 04: Unlimited Kneading\nSkill No. 05: Piercing The Intestines\nSkill No. 06:\nSkill No. 07: Mince The Dough\nSkill No. 08: Rice Bag Smash\nSkill No. 09: Super Strength Strikes\nSkill No. 10:\nOther Techniques\nShoulder Grab\n[\n5\n]\nBear Style\nQuotes\n\"If you cower, suffer and cry out, they feel superior. They bully to show off in front of others. If I do as they want me to, that means I lose. I don't wanna lose.\"\n[\n6\n]\n\"In order not to give in to anyone, I will overcome this.\"\n[\n7\n]\n\"For me to beat the bad guys, I have to become one.\"\n[\n8\n]\n\"\nThere are no shortcuts. Effort will not betray you. If you give it your all, your body will not betray your effort.\"\n[\n9\n]\nTrivia\nEuntae is modeled after\nBill Stax\n. a South Korean rapper.\nBrekdak and most of the characters in the anime pronounce Euntee nickname as \"Basco\" due to the V sounding like a B while saying it in a Korean accent.\nAside from doing suggested training regiments from Goo, Vasco also attends a gym.\nEuntae loves dogs, especially Golden Retrievers.\nWhen\nDaniel Park\nwas taking care of Inu, he really wanted to see her and was excited to see the puppies, he never knew\nJay Hong\nwas actually taking care of them.\nThere are at least 5 particular panels that are humorously repeated in which Euntae is shown with a tear streaming down his face with Jace witnessing this and thinking to himself, \"Euntae...\"\nThere were a lot of references to\nOne Punch Man\nreferencing Euntae\nWhen Euntae asks Joon Goo how he can get stronger, Joon Goo's advice to Euntae is to do one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10\u00a0km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3.\nMoreover, in the Lee Euntae arc,\nJace\ngets angry at the bullies when he sees them after they'd grown up, saying that, because of them, he'd had to train so hard with Euntae he'd almost gotten bald, which is also a Saitama reference.\nAnother reference is in\nEpisode 112\n, when Euntae tells\nDaniel\nto go on a diet, he is given a banana to eat in the morning, which also seems to reference the diet Saitama talks about in One Punch Man, Episode 3.\nThe nickname \"Vasco\" was given to Euntae because \"Vasco\" in the universe of the work is a cartoon/comic hero, who fights for justice by protecting the weak.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 9\n\u2191\nLookism Animated series IMDB page\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt22297722/\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 210\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 31\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 9\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 54\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 56\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 31\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 51"

        "relationships": "Jace Park\nBum Jae is his best and most trusted friend. Bum Jae helped Euntae get over his fear of needles, by getting tattoos together, and even has a tattoo of his hero-man E.T. (Euntae). The duo is very close with each other and they often work out together.\nBum Jae seems to be a bit protective over Euntae, to the point of installing a lover app to track him and making sure that he does not get hurt or get into a big mess. The reason Bum Jae is so protective over Euntae maybe because he felt that he could never make up for the time he ditched Euntae back in middle school. However, this is not confirmed.\nEuntae often asks for his advice either about the Burn Knuckles and even his personal life. Bum Jae is also vice-leader of Burn Knuckles, which shows how much Euntae trusts him. The duo are extremely close and their friendship is admired by many people.\nGoo Kim\nIn the Lee Euntae Arc, when Euntae was being bullied, another boy who was getting bullied was a relative of\nGoo Kim\nand paid him to beat up the bullies. When Goo Kim arrives, he sees how much the bullies had hurt Euntae and says that this time will be free because, with an obvious victim, Goo Kim can do whatever he wants to them.\nEuntae asks Goo Kim how he can get stronger, whose advise was to do one hundred push ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10\u00a0km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3.\nDaniel Park\nEuntae first meet Daniel when being harassed during work. When they met again at school Euntae didn't like him at first. Later on, they became closer friends.\nDuke Pyeon\nEuntae sees himself in Duke as they were both bullied viciously in their youth. Vasco tries to protect Duke from bullies, and he is the reason Vasco hates\nVin Jin\n."

Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Euntae's superstitious ideas, making fun of Euntae, saying that ghosts don't actually exist.

At school, Daniel becomes interested in the\nBurn Knuckles\nand decides to help them out, growing fond of them.\nAt the workout Daniel asks Jace about Vasco, who he thinks is amazing. Jace wonders if Daniel was bullied and that's why Vasco hangs out with him. He decides to tell him Vasco's backstory.\nEpisode 52\nJace used to be Vasco's only friend when he was little, because he had a strange personality. In middle school, Jace became friends with the popular kids in class. When a popular senior asks them to smoke, Vasco tells Jace to stay away from them because they are losers. The senior begins to bully Vasco.\nJace tries to stay away from Vasco so he doesn't get hurt, but he is guilty about it. He pretends everything is fine, even when he sees him crying alone. When Vasco stops coming to school, the cool kids call Jace to meet the senior.\nEpisode 53\nWhen he meets him Jace notices another kid getting bullied, a kid they call \"Cicada\". The senior tells him to bring Vasco to school or he will take his place. He then draws on his face. Jace asks the kid about Vascoand hears that no matter how hard he was bullied he never cried or surrendered.\nJace goes to visit Vasco and finds he doesn't look very sick. There are bloody napkins on his dresser and he is scared of Jace's pen. He rips off Vasco's blanket and finds curse words and drawings carved into his chest.\nEpisode 54\nJace starts crying and tells Vasco to apologize. Vasco refuses, saying if he does then he will have lost against his bullies. Jace goes to school and tells them to stop bullying Vasco. They beat him and prepare to carve him when Vasco comes in.

They are outmatched and getting beaten when the door slams open.\nGoo Kim\nwalks in with his cousin the Cicada who was bullied by the senior. He paid Goo to beat up the seniors and stop the bullying. Goo spies Vasco's carvings and decides to beat the bullies for free instead.\nEpisode 56\nGoo beats all of the bullies easily and sadistically. Everyone is brought to the principal's office where they decide to drop the matter to avoid police investigation. Vasco asks Goo how he can become stronger and he tells him a ridiculous workout of 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats and a 10\u00a0km run every day.\nJace decided to get tattoos to encourage Vasco to cover his. He was still afraid of needles, but less so. He finishes telling the story to Daniel, who is touched. They overhear some bikers in the area and Jace recognizes his old bullies.\nEpisode 57\nThe thugs recognize Jace and want to beat him, but they are intimidated by Vasco, who they don't recognize. They take Daniel to the alleyway and ask if he and Jace are friends. Daniel isn't sure but Jace appears and claims him as a friend. The thugs attack him and he beats them easily and tells Daniel to come with him.\nDuring the time the thugs were expelled, Goo met with\nGun\nfor a partnership test. Both of them passed and began collecting money from the\nfour crews\n. The bullied kid became a bully after the entire incident. Jace and Vasco each get personal tattoos as well; Vasco gets one called \"Hero Man\" (Jace) and Jace gets one called \"ET\" (Eun Tae) to remember their best friends.\nNotes\nThe workout Goo gave Vasco

        "synopsis": "Episode 1\nDaniel is forced to pretend to be Pikachu\nThe story begins with Daniel Park being bullied by Logan Lee in a bathroom. Daniel is fat and poor, so Logan likes to pick on him. He makes him do degrading acts like pretending to be an animal and being his personal ashtray. Daniel puts up with the abuse because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. He takes his aggression out on his mother, who doesn't know he is being bullied.\nOne day at school Logan places a bet that Daniel cannot avoid his shot but he does. He begins beating Daniel for not listening to him, and Daniel's mother witnesses this.\nEpisode 2\nDaniel says mean things to his mother\nDaniel's mother asks him if he's okay and scolds Daniel, embarrassing him. He then furiously yells at his mother, stating that she is embarrassing him and Daniel apologizes to Logan. This secretly makes Daniel feel miserable and he even called himself the 'world's biggest piece of trash'. After school his mother sits him down and confirms she allows him to transfer. Daniel realizes that his mother knew that he was getting bullied but pretended not to know, and he starts crying.\nDaniel's new haircut makes him look like Kim Jong-un\nDespite feeling guilty, Daniel listens to his mother and decides to start fresh. Daniel finds his new home which turns out to be an old shack. Daniel goes to a hair dresser and has his hair cut to a 'two-block' hairstyle, but he ends up looking like Kim Jong Un.\nZack gets angry while Mira tries to stop him\nOn his way from the hairdresser he spots Mira Kim looking at him. He thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her. Zack Lee sees Daniel smile at Mira and gets jealous, but Mira prevents him from fighting. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behavior. However, Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Unable to keep his anger under control, Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders take pictures and upload them online.\nDaniel's first time looking at his new body in the mirror\nThat night, Daniel cries himself to sleep because he had gone viral online, and had lost his chance at a new start. When he wakes up, he goes to the bathroom to check his probably tear-swollen eyes and finds that the ceiling and sink look much lower than before. He then finds himself looking very different, with a slim figure and extraordinarily handsome appearance. He stays in utter shock before falling out of the bathroom in confusion and bewilderment, only to find his old body which is found to be sleeping peacefully on the floor.\nEpisode 3\nDaniel slaps his old body in his new body\nDaniel, in his new body, ponders on who he should tell about the current situation and he finally decides to rely on himself. He attempts to wake his old body up but after failed attempts, Daniel forcefully wakes his old body up with a harsh slap.

He finally decides to be in his new body during daytime while being in his old body during nighttime.\nDaniel attracts attention at school for his beauty\nThe next day, two schoolgirls are shown commenting on the looks of some of the schoolboys and they compliment practical music student Beom, stating that his dyed hair looks cute.

Surprisingly they offer him a cigarette and say that he should hook them up with girls. Daniel lies to them that he quit smoking (so that he doesn't have to smoke while not making himself look 'uncool') and informs them that he doesn't know any girls. The three other boys, including Doo, feel intimidated and think of Daniel as imposing while he quickly runs off in fear.\nLater, Daniel is seen peacefully sleeping with Daniel watching him adoringly.

While he finds that in his new body, the owner is very willing to hire him, the owner is more reluctant when it comes to his old body.

Though, the salary is still lower in his old body.\nDuring his shift, he comes across Zack and his friends who are trying to buy some cigarettes. He refuses them and gets beaten, and they take a nude picture of him to blackmail him. When his mother calls him again he tells her his life is going well, but doesn't mention the incident.

        "synopsis": "Episode 163\nJiho\nis upset that he is invisible to\nDaniel's\nfriends. He envies Daniel and wishes he could be like him. At an ATM machine he meets\nJames Gong\n, a former classmate in middle school. He lends him money and James tells Jiho he wants to hang out with him. Jiho is scared that James will bully him but James befriends Jiho and invites him out to eat with his friends at a bar.\nAs Jiho hangs out with James he realizes how much fun it is to be included in a group. To act tough he suggests they trash the bar's owners and James chucks a brick at the car. Jiho realizes James may not be a good friend after all.\nEpisode 164\nJiho tries to ignore James and his friends but is drawn to them again. He visits them at a pool place they use to hang out. James asks Jiho if he can lend money from him and Jiho offers to make him a bank account. He allows James to make his own password and signs it in his name. Daniel notices that Jiho is not hanging out with him anymore and grows concerned.\nAs James walks down the road he complains about the amount of money he owes. He notices a sign buying bank accounts. Jiho gets messages from a teenager complaining that he scammed him of a phone purchase he made. The teen confronts him at school and tells him to come outside.\nEpisode 165\nDaniel tells the kid to back off Jiho and Jiho takes him to James. James denies knowing about the account and beats the kid's friends. Jiho gives him his own phone to pay for the loss and worries James forgot about the account.\nWhen Jiho gets to the computer he sees there are multiple scams in his name. He tries to freeze his account but he cannot remember his pin. He goes to the police station but they are closed for the weekend. Jiho sits on the curb and cries, wondering what he will do.\nEpisode 166\nJiho goes to a cyber caf\u00e9 to try and figure out how to stop the scams. He runs into\nDoo\nand his friends who laugh at Jiho for being in trouble again. Jiho attacks Doo and starts fighting him, and both are stopped by\nZack\n. Doo backs off and Jiho asks Zack why he is so kind to him when he never considered him a friend. Zack asks Jiho if he thinks of Zack as a friend, and Jiho doesn't answer.\nZack interrogates Jiho and finds out he was scammed. He tells\nMira\nhe is leaving with a friend, and goes to find James. They head to the pool place and he beats up the guys at the table. He confronts James and tells him to give Jiho his account back.\nEpisode 167\nJames laughs at Zack and tells him his fly is undone. Jiho sees through the trick and protects Zack from James' attack while Zack beats James. James tells Jiho that he sold the account for money and that he can't reach the buyers because they use burner phones.\nZack calls his friends and they gather in the cyber caf\u00e9 to help Jiho. Zack finds the emails of the burner phone possessors and gives each person a number of emails to scour through, but they don't find anything.\nKouji\noverhears Jiho's situation and realizes he is a friend of\nJay\n. He decides to help them to get on Jay's good side.\nEpisode 168\nKouji explains that the email plan didn't work because emails are anonymous. He tells Jiho that most gamers reuse their usernames and finds the culprit's username \"Power Gundam\" on a gaming website. He finds the culprit's Naver account and begins searching through their social media until he finds a photo of some darts and a convenience store.\nVasco\nruns out of the building at this picture.\nKouji uses the location the picture was taken at to find the hangout of the culprit. They call Vasco but he explains he already found the location of the picture. He finds the\nGod Dogs\nat a dart place and tells them to give him Jiho's bank account.\nEpisode 169\nThe God Dogs laugh at Vasco but quickly stop as he destroys them all.\nJin Jang\nwatches Vasco fight and recognizes him from the photograph as one of Daniel's friends. He fights Vasco and predicts his every move, beating him easily. He says\nJohan\nwill be pleased to know that Vasco came alone.\nIn a car, Johan is being driven by Gun and Goo after returning from his mother's store. Gun warns him to be careful of Jin because he is known to be a scammer, and that could ruin Johan's chances of being his successor. Johan assures him Jin's scamming days are over, but he is worried about his sadistic tendencies.\nBack at the dart place Vasco is severely wounded. Jin prepares to end the fight but he is hit with a low kick out of nowhere. Vasco reveals that he has been training in Muay Thai, and the only reason he didn't use it is because losing is a shameful thing for a student. He stands in preparation for a fight.\nEpisode 170\nJin Jang tells Vasco to give up and join the God Dogs while he still can. He is worried Johan will find out about the bank account incident, so he tells Vasco to keep it a secret. Vasco ignores Jin and starts fighting him. Jin finds himself severely outmatched by Vasco, who is not only strong but well trained. As Vasco knocks Jin out he tells him the\nBurn Knuckles\nwill never be swallowed by anyone, because they have their own agenda.\nDaniel's friends race to the dart place to see Vasco has already handled the situation. They take Jiho's account and return all the money to their owners. Vasco is cheered on by the Burn Knuckles for his bravery and Daniel notices Jiho stopped coming to school.\nThe 4 crews hear about the incident and become interested in Vasco. Johan visits Jin in the hospital and is told that Vasco beat Jin for trying to recruit him. He is disappointed because Vasco knows Daniel, and he considered Daniel a friend. He tells the God Dogs to prepare for a gang war with J high.\nEpisode 171\nJiho is upset that he is too weak to do anything for himself. He tries to workout and gets tired easily and remembers how strong his friends are. Just as he is about to give up he spies the pocket knife on the floor next to him and decides he can do something after all. He leaves his house and his mother complains that a friend is waiting for him. Daniel (the friend) is concerned about Jiho.\nJiho visits James at the pool place and slices him with the knife, asking if James thinks he is weak. When he trips on his own legs James replies that he does, and begins hitting Jiho with the pool stick. Daniel holds James back and tells Jiho to run while he can.\nJiho gets upset at Daniel and tells him to mind his business. When Daniel mentions that they are friends Jiho scoffs at him, asking how he can relate to Jiho. Daniel mentions that Jiho is friends with his other body and\nDuke\n, and they can relate to him. Jiho is triggered and pushes Daniel and James out the window.\nNotes\nThe man asking James to stop peeing in the street is the same old man Johan accused of stealing his dog in the animal cruelty

He agrees.\nEpisode 23\nAt first, Duke is embarrassed to reveal he is poor to Daniel, but Daniel does not care about it. He has a good voice but not that much practice, and he and Duke practice. Daniel practices at his night job and runs into\nthe pretty girl\n, who compliments his voice. He also meets Jiho and Duke, and Jiho apologizes to him.\nThe three of them sit outside the store and reminisce about their days being bullied. Vasco overhears and asks about Daniel. He learns that Daniel genuinely cares about his friends and feels bad he misjudged him. He tells Daniel he is not weak and he can help him work out. Duke is impressed to see Daniel improved overnight and is confident about the festival.\nEpisode 24\nThe festival begins and departments choose candidates for the slave auction, where girls get to date a guy for one day. Daniel is chosen because Zack refused out of his love for\nMira\n. The Baking Department and the Architecture Department are doing poorly but the Beauty Department thrives off\nEli Jang's\na massive number of fangirls.\nThe slave auction begins and the girls start to choose. Vasco is not sold because girls are scared of him, and he cries. Eli Jang is bought by his department who refuses to let any other girls talk to him. The girls begin to fight over Daniel.\nEpisode 25\nLala Kim is a rich student from a private school. She bids the highest out of anyone in the area, but another girl bids higher than her. She is eventually outbid by the girl, who Daniel recognizes as the pretty girl from the convenience store, whose name is Crystal. He thanks her and she tells him not to look down on people just because he is handsome.\nDaniel tries to chase after her but is stopped by\nGun\n, her bodyguard. He grabs Daniel but he hits his hand away, surprising Gun. Gun kicks Daniel and decides to beat him. Vasco overhears the confrontation.\nEpisode 26\nVasco interrupts and tells Gun not to mess with him. Gun hits him in the face but he does not back down. Crystal threatens to tell her father to fire Gun and he decides to let them go. Crystal apologizes for Gun's behavior and tells Daniel to not be a stranger. As she leaves, he notices she looked like she pitied him.\nVasco buckles under the pain he has been hiding and says he cannot beat Gun. Daniel thanks him for helping and is happy that Vasco called him a friend. When the night falls he prepares for his musical performance with Duke.\nEpisode 27\nDaniel is scared to be on stage and is overcome with stage fright. Duke begins rapping and Daniel is reminded of Duke's advice to remember someone he loves. He thinks of his mother and begins singing from the heart. They blow the audience away with their performance.\nAfter the performance, Daniel and Duke are high from the excitement. Vin's manager comes to Daniel and asks him to audition. He rejects Duke because his looks aren't good enough to be in the industry. Duke is even cut out of the official footage of the performance. However, Duke refuses to give up on his career and vows to try harder next time.\nNotes\nSome of these episodes have their own soundtrack sung by the character's real-life

        "synopsis": "Episode 127\nDaniel\nsits on the bed in the Nurse's Room, thinking deeply about how to avoid\nLogan\n. He comes to the conclusion that since Logan is in a different class, it won't be difficult to avoid him. Daniel gets up and tries to open the door so he can leave but the door won't budge because Logan is also trying to open it from the other side.\nThe scene then cuts off to\nVasco\nand\nJace\nwalking down the hallways with the freshmen greeting them with respect. Vasco notices\nLeonn\ngreet him casually. Vasco asks him for his name and the people tell him to speak formally to his senior, Vasco. Leonn states that Vasco promised to fight him in the past. Vasco is still unable to remember and this angers Leonn, who then proceeds to kick Vasco in the shin out of frustration. Vasco collapses and Jace asks Vasco if that Leonn's kick hurt him that much and Vasco says it was Logan's attack that did it. Vasco labels Logan as a 'punk' and comments that he's unbelievably strong.\nThe scene switches back to Daniel and Logan. Both of them continue to attempt to open the door with unbelievable strength and force and the door finally opens and Daniel accidentally bumps into Logan. Daniel panics, remembering that the two have actually met before and hopes that Logan doesn't recognise him. Logan tells him to piss off and Daniel attempts to leave. Suddenly,\nZoe\nholds Daniel's arm and asks him if he's okay.  Remembering his insecurity around handsome guys who always have girls follow them around, he stops Daniel with anger.\nA flashback to Logan's past is shown, when he had his first girlfriend. Logan used to date\nMae's\nold girlfriend, who liked him because he was strong. She cheated on Logan for a handsome guy, and from that day on Logan hated handsome guys. He also became violent towards women. He grabs Daniel's shoulder and is surprised when he doesn't back down.\nEpisode 128\nDaniel collapses out of fear of Logan Lee. Zoe hits Logan and tells him to stop bullying Daniel, and he calls her a slut. When she remarks that she likes Piggy he is disgusted and walks away. He spies her sitting with fat Daniel and wonders if she is telling the truth before seeing her with the handsome Daniel. He becomes depressed and avoids school.\nJay-Gal\nis worried about Logan and visits him. Logan returns to school having lost most of his weight and is now incredibly skinny.\nEpisode 129\nNo one believes Logan is in the comics department because he is good looking. He discovers girls find his bad attitude attractive instead of intimidating. He realizes that good looks can be as powerful as strength in influencing others.\nLogan decides to go confess to Zoe. He runs into Mira and tries to seduce her but is hit in the face by an angry\nZack\n.\nEpisode 130\nLogan tries to fight Zack but he is too weak and loses easily in his skinny form. He challenges\nVin\nand gets beat a second time. Vasco tries to help him and looks at him with pity. Even Jay-Gal tries to fight Logan and leaves him bloody.\nLogan goes to her classroom and finds Zoe is sick so she didn't come. He looks at Crystal and sees she resembles Daniel. Logan grabs her face and Daniel grabs his hand.\nEpisode 131\nLogan rushes at Daniel and he dodges his attacks, finishing him with a sucker punch. Zoe comes in to see him on the ground and helps him up. Logan asks her to meet him in a store.\nAt the store, Logan asks Zoe to go out with him. She rejects him for his terrible personality and the way he treated everyone. Logan gets depressed and gains back all the weight he lost.\nCookie 1\nZack\n&\nVasco\nnotice that Logan gained more weight and got bigger, commenting that the Buddha gained more weight, we then see Logan beat Vin in the corridor. We see that\nJay-gal\nis glad that Logan went back to his old self and that no one recognized him when he was lost weight. It then cuts to Zack wondering if he can protect\nMira\nif Logan tries to hurt her again.\nCookie 2\nZack\ntaking up boxing again.

One of the kids is Beom, a freshman who is a popular online clothing model for the Oh Bok Hee company.\nDaniel gets an offer to model for a start-up clothing company called Kian Clothing Company. The salesman doesn't make much but he offers to pay Daniel a good wage. Daniel gets a better offer from a wealthier salesman, making Beom jealous that his boss likes Daniel that much. He decides to think it over.\nAt night Daniel goes shopping with his mother at the department store. The wealthy salesman discriminates against\nDaniel's mother\nand laughs with Beom, calling them beggars. In the morning the other modeling company laugh at the poor salesman's rundown equipment. They are shocked to see Daniel emerge from his van.\nEpisode 72\nThe other salesman asks Daniel what he is doing and offers him even more to model. Daniel rejects him, saying his clothes look worse. Beom becomes jealous of Daniel, and only grows more jealous when he spots his modeling partner\nJoy\nbecoming interested in Daniel.

        "name": "Seoul, the land where",
        "history": "See article:\n2nd Generation\nBoth Gun and Goo sought successors for their business in the meantime, scouring Seoul for suitable candidates. Eventually Gun had to retire from the business and become Crystal's bodyguard, leaving Goo to collect the money by himself.\nUniting the four crews is a task given by Gun to candidates he considers worthy of becoming his successor. Gun not only makes an insane amount of money, he also has a lot of influence due to his wealth. As a result, many people are vying for his and Goo's position. Gun's only rule for someone to be a successor is that they do not engage in illegal activity, because that may get him into legal trouble. Goo has not given this task to anyone.\nGun's first candidate for the job was\nEli Jang\n, but he quit the crew business and disqualified himself. His second candidate was\nJake Kim\n, but he was disqualified due to the illegal betting ring.\nJohan Seong\nwas the third candidate, disqualified due to poor leadership and fake bank accounts. Gun has since offered candidacy to\nDaniel Park\nand\nZack Lee\n, but both have refused on grounds of principle.\nOrganization\nThe Four Major Crews have their own jurisdictions on all four sides of Seoul, with central Seoul remaining neutral. Each gang is responsible for paying a Hundred Million won (86,000 USD) as a monthly fee. While they were encouraged to earn their money through legal methods, illegal methods were expected and quietly allowed as long as they weren't caught. The four crews are divided as follows.\nCentral Seoul:\nBurn Knuckles\n,\nJ High School\n, and\nAllied\nWhile they aren't considered part of the Four Major; Burn Knuckles, and J High were considered a big threat enough to keep the Four Major crews from taking over Central Seoul completely.\nThe Burn Knuckles was founded by\nVasco\nduring his first year in high school, he would go around grabbing delinquents with his shoulder grip, warning them to stop smoking. The delinquents were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department in order to join him, eventually forming the Burn Knuckles. Vasco would indirectly recruit all potential delinquents who could have joined any of the four major crews and would transform them into protectors of the weak. They would protect Central Seoul from foreign gangs, thus keeping Central Seoul in neutral territory.\nDue to the number of students who know martial arts, J High School would occasionally aid Burn Knuckles in their fight against the Four Major Crews. Unlike Burn Knuckles, the fighters from J High are not organized and only get involved when they personally get caught in the crossfire. While members like Big Daniel and Zack were always ready to jump into conflict when their friends were in danger, members like Vin Jin and Logan would only join the fight if it personally benefitted them. The only time J High would truly be untied was in their battle against\nHostel A\n.\nWith the end of the\nHunt for Big Deal\nand the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the Four Major Crews, Little Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers continue to grow in power and finally decided to create an organized force to combat them, a crew. He founded Allied with only one goal, the collapse and eventual eradication of Workers. When the group was formed, he approached multiple people to join his cause.\nVasco\nquickly accepted the offer, bringing alongside the tactician\nJace Park\nand the manpower of\nBurn Knuckles\n.\nZack Lee\n, fresh from being trained at the Buddhist temple, joined alongside Vasco.\nJay Hong\njoined the group to assist Little Daniel in finding the Big Daniel and\nHudson Ahn\njoined in order to confront and get revenge on\nEli Jang\n. These were the original five members and eventually more people would join.\nNorth:\nGod Dog\n(Gangbuk)\nBefore Johan entered the picture, the Gangbuk region was ruled over by\nK-House\n, a crew run by\nJin Jang\nwhose main business is fake bank accounts. They would rule undisturbed until\nJohan Seong\nappeared, he wanted to rule over this region to impress Gun and become his successor. It was the only way to get on\nCharles Choi's\ngood side and get his mom her surgery. He defeated every grew in Gangbuk by himself and K-house was no different. After his takeover, he would change its name to God Dog, creating a new crew out of the collection of various Gangbuk crews he defeated in the past.\nThis was the second of the Four Major Crews Burn Knuckles and J High came face to face with and by far God Dog was the weakest, while they had the manpower, the crew had weak leadership. No one saw Johan as their leader but they still followed his orders as he maintained his leadership through fear and intimidation.\nJin Jang\nwould become second in command and was responsible for collecting the money and maintaining the headcount of the God Dogs. He would look loyal to Johan on the outside but behind closed doors he would use this position of power to create a coup of people who wanted to overthrow Johan as they hated being under his leadership, this coup would mainly contain members of K-House who wanted to be their own separate gang once again.\nJohan would try and stop his gang from earning money through scams, as illegal activity would ruin his chances as\nGun\n's successor. This would be God Dog's downfall as during the climax of the\nGod Dog Arc\n, the problems of poor leadership would finally shine through. The moment he commands his men to fight Burn Knuckles, he is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. While Burn Knuckles and J High are shocked, God Dog laughs at Johan in his weak state. He asks his crew why they betrayed him, and Jin explains that they never liked him to start with. They only they waited this long just to get revenge on the Burn Knuckles and now they didn't need him anymore.  They try and cripple Johan, but he gets up quickly and starts to absolutely sherd his old crew, claiming that he would destroy the God Dogs and the Burn Knuckles and make a new crew. Before he gets a chance to beat down Jin, Gun comes out of the shadows and tells Johan that he is disqualified from the Four Major Crews and his successor due to his poor leadership. Not only was he unable to stop them from continuing illegal business but there wasn't any trust and could have turned on him at any moment. Johan begs Gun to reconsider but Gun refuses to, telling Johan he had his chance. As Johan starts crying for his mother and Gun warns him not to turn out like Jake, but like he did in the past, Johan becomes desperate and decides to fight Gun.  During the fight, Gun notices how much Johan has improved, with his only weakness being that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with one punch.\nAs Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him, He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out of the way by Zack. While the J high trio stepped in to protect Johan from Gun, Johan didn't have any interest in thanking them and disappeared. Since then, most former members returned to\nK House\n, some tried joining Big Deal and some joined\nHostel\nA. Eventually, all of them would be absorbed into\nWorkers\nunder\nSamuel Seo\n's Fourth Affiliate. Johan Seong still calls himself a God Dog, although some say that he was the only God Dog to exist as he was the only one who believed in his ideals. After the gang's collapse, he refused the position of being the Ruler of Gangbuk, without being a successor of Gun, ruling over it would be pointless. This makes Gangbuk the only region in Seoul that is not ruled over by an overarching gang, due to this empty position, most small gangs that went into hiding due to Johan now came out of the shadows trying to get leadership to rule over Gangbuk. This conflict would escalate all the way into becoming another PTJ comic,\nQuestism\n.\nWest:\nBig Deal\n(Gangseo)\nBig Deal is most likely the oldest of the four major crews as it has a history in Gangseo with multiple heads. Not much is known about their origins but they were seen as just another gang, that was until \"The Boy of Promise\"  Sinu Han joined the gang. Due to his dedication and devotion to protecting the street that took him in, he joined\nBig Deal\nin order to rise up the ranks and become the new \"Big Boss\" and use the gang to protect the street. He would eventually accomplish that and took over the gang, he would make some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.\nTheir main business is an illegal betting ring. Jake's actions in the illegal betting arc led to him being locked up at a juvenile detention center, along with many other important members of Big Deal, but they were eventually released later on in the story.\n[\n1\n]\nEast:\nHostel\n(Gangdong)\nOriginally Back-Door was supposed to be the crew running in the East, but after\nDarius Hong\n, the head of the crew, was defeated by\nEli Jang\n, Gun changed his mind about them and made Hostel into a crew instead.\nAt the time of Chapter 149 Hostel was in the middle of a major makeover, but they were considered \"the worst criminals\".\nEli Jang\nused to be the head of the Hostel and was considered one of the top candidates to be Jong Gun's successor.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nTheir main operation involve the runaway fams.\nSouth:\nWorkers\n(Gangnam)\nThe Workers was originally described by Jace as \"beyond a teenage level,\" and they are seen as more of \"an enterprise than a crew.\" They are known to be hard to locate, as they dress like a typical professional person.\nThe Workers Head Chairman is\nEugene\nwho was scouted by\nGoo\n.\n[\n4\n]\nWorkers is composed of 4 Branches:\n4th Affiliate lead by\nAlexander Hwang\nand executive\nSamuel Seo\n; earns money through online illegal streaming;\n3rd Affiliate with\nVivi\nas the head and several executives, including\nXiaolong\n; they sell drugs at their club.\n2nd Affiliate has\nNeko\n(Mitsuki) as its president. They run a circus where they force criminals to play gruesome games where an audience bet on the players. They used to run a fighting den prior.\n1st Affiliate has\nHangyeoul Baek\nas its president. They have Plastic Surgery in Gangnam as it's business and currently Reinforced by\nWhite Tiger Job Centre\n, Workers 5th Affiliate and more. Other Information still unknown but they are probably protecting\nJinyoung Park\nagainst the people who want to get him and he's considered as\nCharles Choi's\nweakness.",
        "synopsis": "The 4 crews were first mentioned by\nDG\n, who told\nDaniel Park\nthat if he united the four crews he would tell him the secret of his bodies.\n[\n5\n]\nSince Daniel did not know who or what the Four Major Crews meant, he looked to\nJace Park\nfor advice since he \"seemed like [he]'d know about that\".\n[\n6\n]\nWebtoon,\nWhen Daniel Park asked Jace for information,\nJace Park\nsaid that there are two rumors surrounding the Four Major Crews: the first being that one person is behind the whole creation of the Four Major Crews.

Gapryong Kim was a legendary figure in the Korean underworld and the central force behind the Pre-Generation, also known as the 0th Generation. Revered for his unmatched strength and feared leadership, he unified Korea's criminal world under his rule during his peak, which is estimated to have occurred around 25 to 30 years before the main events of\nLookism\n. This timeline is supported by the ages of his sons\u2014Kitae Kim, the eldest at 27, and Jake Kim, the youngest at 19\u2014suggesting that Gapryong's dominance took place in the late 1990s or early 2000s. In Chapter 556, it is stated that he amassed a fortune \u201calmost as much as the entire budget of Seoul city at the time,\u201d placing his estimated net worth in the multi-billion dollar range, a staggering sum that reflected the scale of his control over the criminal world. Although he later failed in his attempt to enter politics, there is no indication that he lost his fortune entirely; in fact, the luxurious lifestyle maintained by Jake Kim and Minseon Kang after his death\u2014including residence in a large mansion\u2014suggests that a significant portion of his wealth may have remained intact or been hidden. His legacy continues to shape the present narrative, particularly through Jake Kim, who carries the weight of his father\u2019s name and influence. Gapryong Kim's legendary status in\nLookism\nis further solidified by his confrontation with the Yamazaki Clan, a formidable Yakuza syndicate led by Shingen Yamazaki. This clash occurred during the Pre-Generation era, a time when Gapryong's Fist Gang was at its peak. The Yamazaki Clan, known for their strength and influence, posed a significant threat, but Gapryong's leadership and combat prowess led to their defeat. This victory not only demonstrated his dominance over domestic criminal organizations but also over powerful foreign syndicates. The aftermath of this battle had lasting effects, with Shingen Yamazaki falling into a lethargic state, indicating the profound impact of their encounter. This event underscores Gapryong Kim's unparalleled strength and strategic acumen in the\nLookism\nuniverse.",
        "relationships": "Image Gallery\n\u201c\nI mean, from a woman's perspective, Gapryong was the worst piece of shit ever... but he could be never pass by someone in need or ignore any kind of injustice.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Minseon Kang about Gapryong,\nEp. 311\nGapryong Kim\nis the father of two distant children and presumably more, including\nJake Kim\nand\nKitae Kim\n, and is the boss of Gapryong's Fist. He left the fist to pursue politics, an endeavor he never succeeded in before he died. He is the most influential member of the Pre-Generation.",
        "appearance": "Gapryong Kim possessed an exceptionally imposing and well-developed physique, characterized by a powerful and athletic build. His musculature was highly defined, with broad shoulders, a wide chest, and a pronounced V-taper created by an expansive back and a narrow waist. The structure of his back muscles was particularly remarkable \u2014 densely layered and deeply contoured, suggesting not only years of physical conditioning but also extensive real-world combat experience. His arms were thick and muscular, with visible vascularity and strength-oriented development, indicating both raw power and practical functionality. He was frequently depicted wearing gloves, underscoring his association with hand-to-hand combat and further reinforcing his image as a physical enforcer. Even in formal attire, his strength remained apparent \u2014 tailored suits clung to a frame built not for show, but for dominance and resilience. Facially, Gapryong Kim bore sharp, chiseled features and a commanding expression that exuded confidence and authority. His eldest son, Kitae, is noted to be a direct reflection of Gapryong in his prime, while Jake Kim is said to resemble his father almost identically during his younger years.",
        "personality": "He was playful, loyal, and protective of the weak. However, he was very flirtatious and had many children besides Jake Kim, leading to resentment from his partners. Gapryong's personality was a blend of stoicism, charisma, and a deep sense of justice. He was known to be reserved yet commanding, often inspiring loyalty without demanding it. His actions were guided by a strong moral compass, and he was willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. As much as Kim Gapryong is seen as a person who does not tolerate no kind of injustice, proving his kindness. According to\nMinseon Kang\n, When she was talking to\nJake Kim\n, She claimed that Gapryong had two sides, a good and a bad one, when she was referring to both her son Jake, and his son who represented his evil side,\nKitae Kim\n. In other words, even though gapryong is a fair and kind person, he probably has a perverse personality like Kitae's, which has not yet been introduced. Analyses of Gapryong Kim's character suggest he aligns with the ISTJ personality type, characterized by a strong sense of duty, practicality, and reliability. This assessment reflects his methodical approach to leadership and his unwavering commitment to his principles.",
        "fighting_prowess": "In\nhis\nfight with\nJichang Kwak\nCharles Choi stated that if his hands were his strength, he wouldn't have been the second-in-command of the Oth Generation, which indicated that Gapryong Kim's physical strength was much higher than that of\nElite\n. Even so, Elite, who past his prime can beat a 1st Gen king with little to no difficulty.  His level of finesse, combined with his superhumanly articulate body, is beyond what any fighter in the series has achieved in the most simplistic of movements, as stated by\nJinyoung Park\n. Gapryong Kim is an arguable candidate for the strongest fighter in the series.Taesoo Ma once mentioned that Gapryong (together with Jake and Kitae) were the only people that could block\ninvisible attacks\nfrom fighters such as Elite, James Lee and Sinu Han.Not much else is known about the legendary dragon Gapryong Kim before the upcoming Cheonliang arc, even though he was the No.1 of his generation, but he had fighters such as Elite, Jinyoung Park and\nTom Lee\nto be under him. \"Lightning Choi\" once asked Gapryong how he was so strong but all that was answered back was overcome (overcome all obstacles). Also, Gapryong was called a master of his 'powers' and the originator of the legendary Kim's bloodline, stating that Jake and his\nbrother\nhave 'Unlimited Potential'. Gapryong's fist power was so powerful that even Jinyoung Park, who got the copy ability and all of the experience from the pre-generation, can only copy up to 3 moves from Gapryong.\nQuotes\n\"I Told you. A lie can make a man weaker... But it will make a man with principles stronger\" - Gapryong to Beolgu\n[\n1\n]\nTrivia\nGapryong had a vasectomy done under the request of his wife after she had\nJake Kim\n, making Jake Gapryong's youngest child..\n[\n2\n]\nCan punch hard. His fighting style is said to be so strong that even Jinyoung Park, who was the first copy user since the 0th Generation, could only manage three strikes at best before being fatigued.\nDuring Jinyoung's fight against Tom in the latest chapter, Jinyoung went into a rage state and accused Tom of killing Gapryong, which Tom heavily denies, citing that there's no reason for him to kill Gapryong.\nThere are many culprits said to be involved in his murder case. Notable ones include James Lee, Kitae Kim and Charles Choi.\nIt is likely that Gapryong is based on the real-life figure of\nKim Du-han\n.\nReferences\n\u2191\nEpisode 454\n\u2191\nEpisode 312"

        "appearance": "Gongseob is a tall, bulky man with pale skin and black hair. His hair is styled into a buzz cut and paired with a short beard. The lobes of his ears are stretched, which conforms to his image as a Buddhist monk, and his eyes are typically closed in a smiling expression.\nHe dons the clothing of a Korean Buddhist monk, having draped an orange garment over clothes of pale grey. He also wears a Rolex watch, expensive sneakers, and glasses with black frames. A greyish pendant shaped like a Christian cross hangs from a cord around his neck, and he is often seen carrying a moktak in hands, tapping it as a monk would.\nThe long fabric of Gongseob's religious habit hides his missing right leg, which has been replaced with a prosthetic that appears to be made of a shiny grey metal\n[\n1\n]\n.\nIn a recollection of his past as a king of the first generation, Gongseob had a slimmer build and a clean-shaven face. His head was not shorn, but had hair braided into cornrows, and his ears were pierced. He wore a ring on each pointer finger, and glasses of a design similar to his current ones.",
        "personality": "Gongseob Ji is seemingly religious, crying out to the Buddha as a means of calming himself and claiming to have \"left the secular world\"\n[\n2\n]\nbehind. However, it is revealed that he actively participates in the secular, partying with several women at a time\n[\n3\n]\nand partaking in strong drink on multiple occasions. There is at least one instance exhibited where he became so inebriated that he began playing his moktak with a bottle of alcohol\n[\n4\n]\n. To further disprove his supposed position of monk, Gongseob adorns himself in riches, possessing a varied collection of expensive brand items. He does not engage in any religious practices of significance, being shown to neither devote his time to prayer, nor cleaning his prayer area as a true monk would.",

His unorthodox style of boxing- the \"Boxing of Iron\", mainly emphasized on speed and endurance. He was stated to be the fastest in that realm, until he was defeated by James Lee.\nAfter his defeat, he was left with only one leg. Moving around was already a huge inconvenience, considering how his fighting style stemmed from the use of his legs.\nAs a result, he created a new skill: One Step, One Kill.\nOne Step, One Kill\nUtilising his disadvantage to only be able to take a single step, Gongseob uses this to his advantage to pivot his body and land a devastating counterpunch from any angle.

        "appearance": "Joon Goo is a lean-built man with glasses and dyed blond hair. He is always shown fashionably dressed, in a similar fashion as Jong Gun. Contrary to Gun, Joon Goo dresses in relatively lighter colors, (white and gold) as opposed to Gun's (grey and black). [1]",
        "personality": "Joon Goo's Crazy side\nJoon Goo comes across as unpredictable and indifferent. Most of the time, he appears to be an easygoing person, and he even retains this laid-back attitude in battle, even against powerful opponents like Logan, Johan, Gun, Sinu Han, and Daniel. However, beneath this carefree fa\u00e7ade, he can be extremely violent and sadistic. This is shown when he tells\nVasco's\nbullies that he is a villain, just like them, before viciously striking them in the face with a chair. Tom Lee mentioned that Goo only becomes serious when he is wielding a sword or anything similar.\nHe has showed a strong interest in money. Joon Goo was eager to make some additional money, even if it meant returning to juvie due to the consequences of his activities. However, in Vasco's\nbackstory\n. Goo recognized that \"there is a knife and a victim\" and decided to offer his service on the house. This is because he realized that he found violence more satisfying than the money he initially requested. He despises being underestimated and might become enraged when it occurs. He is known to become rather serious when wielding a sword or anything resembling one, and he regards swords with the utmost respect, as evidenced by his telling Robert Choi of the Black Bear Gang never to use a sword again.\nHe is shown to use the phrase \u201cHoly!\u201d Most likely picked up from hearing\nTom Lee\nsay it.",
        "background": "Goo fighting Gun.(Flashback)\nSeveral years ago, Jong Gun was sent to challenge Goo in a duel. While the outcome remains uncertain, it was clearly a brutal battle, leaving both men with serious injuries. After the fight, they joined forces in the debt collection business and amassed 20 billion won. It is revealed that later on Goo fought\nGun\nagain because Gun left Goo in the debt collecting business to guard\nCrystal Choi\n, again the fight outcome remains unclear but it is confirmed that Goo was indeed the one who gave Gun the scar between his eyes, whereas Gun caused Goo to need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments.\nBefore the events of Lookism, Goo Kim was seen in the Manager Kim webtoon to be a bounty hunter, being given the title of \"Lunatic\" by Zu Pengguan, a major character in the series, hunting down the bounty on Tian Wai Tian's last successor.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Serious Goo\nGoo is a highly skilled combatant and one of the strongest fighters in the PTJ-verse. While his full range of abilities remains unknown, it is clear that he possesses exceptional strength, as he is on par with\nJong Gun\n. However, unlike his partner, Joon Goo excels at turning any object he picks up into a weapon. Despite this, his raw strength and stamina are remarkable, as seen when he shattered three camera stands in\n108\nand endured a relentless assault from Johan Seong in chapter\n263\n. When wielding a sword or anything similar, he becomes significantly more serious, dropping his usual playful demeanor. He possesses incredible durability, which is evident in every battle. At the beginning of a fight, he often takes numerous hits\u2014though it\u2019s possible he does this intentionally. Once Goo picks any object or weapon up, the outcome of the fight is almost always determined, regardless of his opponent. His fight with Johan Seong was already determined when he picked up a piece of wooden lumber. Another display of his skills is when he defeats\nSinu Han\njust by using a chopstick after sharpening it.\nGoo brandishing his watch against Jincheol\nHe is also shown taking out hundreds of experienced weaponized adults when he was 16 alongside\nGun\n(who was also 16) in chapter\n310\n. He is the heir to the Korean sword, which leads him to finally act seriously when wielding the weapon. It is possible he was trained in Kumdo (A proficient sword art of Korea) and Kendo. It is also possible that he is trained in Fencing, Iaido, Eskrima, Silat, and other Weapon-based martial arts; which would explain his specialization in weapons usage and extreme physical capabilities.\nNitoryu (Twin-Sword technique)\nGoo Kim's Twin-Sword Technique\nGoo Kim is able to wield a sword so skillfully that he is able to use two of them in the same instant, further allowing him to deal maximum damage and use a technique called \"Moonlight\" which comprises of 3 phases that aim to kill the opponent.\nFirst Sword: First Moon\nGoo dashes forward at high speed and stabs in its direction with one sword, aiming to target the torso.\nSecond Sword: Crescent Moon\nGoo uses both his swords to swing diagonally, cutting everything in its path.\nThird Sword: Full Moon\nGoo uses both swords to release a flurry of slashes in all directions, slicing everything and anything.\nZero Sword: Eclipse\nIn a last ditch attempt, Goo intentionally lets the opponent flank him and stab both himself and his opponent at the same time, ensuring that he gets pierced through the left of his chest, avoiding any major organs while piercing through the heart of the opponent who is attacking from behind.\nUnarmed Combat\nGoo Kim's abilities when unarmed are unknown, due to his habit of getting hit and not fighting seriously when he doesn't have a weapon. So it's almost impossible to say how strong he is. In episode 97 of the\nManager Kim\nwebtoon, Goo is shown fighting against Park Jincheol (A major character of the series, bearing the alias of \"God of War\"), being able to dodge his attacks, take hits and being able to land a clean hit in return, showing that he can hold his own even without using a weapon.\nQuotes\n\"He doesn't have a serious bone in his body.\"\nTom Lee speaking about Goo\n[\n5\n]\n\"THIS SHIT IS SO CRINGE!\"\nGoo Kim loathing himself after he made his \"sword can be anything\" monologue\n[chapter 473]\n\"The moon keeps rising.\"\nTrivia\nGoo's exact fighting style has not been revealed, unlike most notable fighters in the series.\nHe is the \"Heir of the Korean Sword\".\nHe has asked several characters to be \"secret friends\" with him:\nThe first of his secret friends is\nCheon Taejin\n, of Workers' 1st affiliate, and the last being\nLogan Lee\n, who dropped out of school just to be with him(most probably to laze off and earn money at it).\nGoo considered Johan at first but decided against it because he is a \"momma's boy\".\nThere are currently 5 members of\nGoo Kim's Secret Friends\n.\nHe usually takes in these members after his partner, Gun Park has dropped them.\nThey are affiliated with\nGitae Kim\n.\nHe is one of the five VVIPs of Workers and has a black badge.\n[\n6\n]\nHe hates smoking and tattoos. He also believes \"a body should be soft and smooth\".\nSome of the non-weapon objects, he utilizes (chopsticks and a wooden plank) seem to resemble swords.\nThe official Japanese game information itself states, that Goo's height is\n191cm\n[\n4\n]\n.\nGoo Kim has been named by the author as a member of the 1.5th generation, a group of fighters who rose before the 2nd generation, but after the 1st generation.\n[\n7\n]\nGoo Kim has been described as one of the \"Three Lunatics\" by Zu Pengguan in\nManager Kim\nepisode 98.\nIt's implied that Goo's fighting style is likely to be a superior form of Arnis, due to Logan Lee comparing him to Jay Hong when they were fighting him.\nHe is even trained in martial arts like Kendo, Iaijutsu, Kenjutsu, Iaido, J\u014dd\u014d, B\u014djutsu and even S\u014djutsu. These martial arts are not much known but his mastery in these incredibly rare swordsmanship skills is what makes him a feared opponent when he actually gets a sword (katana).\nGoo is shown to be wearing Gun's clothes on several occasions like the iconic Yellow button-up shirt or the Black suit which he wore in the 1st affiliate arc. This is even confirmed when he told Jincheol Park in\nManager Kim\nepisode 100, that he cannot let him ruin the suit as he borrowed it, from  a hot headed bastard (Gun).\nHe is a sadist as shown when he enjoys violence and brutally beating up perpetrators/bullies just because it's fun.\nHe loves money.\nHe loves branded goods.\nReferences\n\u2191\nEpisode 296\n\u2191\nEpisode 421 - we see goo with his cousin after he beats the bullies\n\u2191\n[Lookism - Ep. 295: Workers(4 Affiliates) (9) | WEBTOON\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nEpisode 344\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 292\n\u2191\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ED0x2R6gMg\nAuthor's youtube"

During the Illegal Gambling Arc, Kim Gi Myung (Jake Kim) states that they (Goo and Gun) are a team that makes around 5 million a year. However, since Jong Gun was hired by the HNH chairman to protect Choi Soo Jung, Gun stopped collecting debts, leaving Joon Goo to do the job all by himself. This infuriates Joon Goo frequently. It is also confirmed during the God Dog Arc that Goo was the one who gave Gun the scar stretching from his right eye to his left.\nCharles Choi\nJoon Goo is one of the ten \"geniuses\" raised by the HNH chairman. Joon Goo works for the chairman and follows his orders.\nEuntae Lee\nGoo had met Vasco in previous years. He knows that Vasco was the kid who has been bullied before, along with Goo's cousin, Maemi. While Vasco was being bullied, Goo shows up and was hired by his cousin to beat the bullies. Vasco, seeing Goo's ability to easily beat the bullies, was impressed and wanted to be strong like him. However, it seems that Goo is not interested and instead gives a perfunctory answer, suggesting 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and running 10 km every day (a reference from the One Punch Man manga). When Goo meets Vasco again during the PTJ Entertainment case, he is surprised that Vasco actually did what he was told when it was just a reference he took from a comic book.\nLogan Lee\nLogan is one of Goo's secret friends. It may be a possibility that he is Goo's successor as he was seen with Goo in Goo's car, also had a fight with him.\nEugene\nGoo introduced Eugene to Charles Choi several years prior to the series. They appear to have already known each other. Goo supported Eugene in his goals for the Workers crew and continues to do so.\nSamuel Seo\nSamuel is one of Goo's four \"secret friends\". He earned Goo's approval while seeking Gun's in Chapter 316 after defeating Johan, Olly and Jake in combat.\nGoo values him greatly, even choosing to turn on the Workers when Samuel was punished for leaking information to Jake Kim in\nThe Hunt for Big Deal\n. In Episode 472, he went so far as to invade the Grimm Surgery Clinic in order to secure Samuel, challenging the infamous\nNo. 1\nin the process."

The two partners are talking to\nJohan Seong\n, who begs Gun to tell the HNH chairman to move his mother up the waiting list for her cornea surgery. However, Gun refuses, repeatedly reminding Johan to complete his task and claim Gun's position as successor. Goo offers an alternative, which involved an immediate payment of a ridiculous amount of $10 million won as a deposit (implying more payments in the future).\nRunaway Fam Arc\nGoo confronts Logan Lee and asks him to meet with him. He reveals that he wants to be secret friends with Logan, but Logan refuses to consider Goo's offer and tells him to fuck off.\nOne Night Arc\nGoo is sent by the HNH chairman to deal with Johan Seong, who is pestering him. He kicks his money out of his hands and steps on it, causing Johan to get angry and attack him. Goo tests Johan's strength and reveals he wanted to become friends with him but decided against it. He then beats him unconscious with a stick, saying he believes Johan has the potential to beat Gun eventually.\nWorkers (four affiliates)\nDaniel, who earned the VVIP status by working as a black badge, appears to be sitting in a chair when he enters Seo Sung-Eun's room. greet with ungrateful grace.\nLater, he talks with Daniel\u00a0and is surprised to hear that Gun gave Daniel a black badge. While talking behind Gun's back, he suddenly smiles and asks him to get rid of the four crew members instead of him.\u00a0When Daniel\u00a0asked what it was and said that he couldn't even touch him because of what Workers were holding, he said, \"If you be my\u00a0secret friend, I'd let you\u00a0know.\" And if\u00a0Daniel comes,\u00a0he said, \"There are four of us.\"\u00a0When Daniel\u00a0lied, saying, \"I'm Gun's successor,\" Daniel said, \"Unlike Gun, I'm not obsessed with him,\" and smiled and fainted Daniel\u00a0in a flash. Then he leaves, saying he will leave a gift for Samuel.\nHe appears at the construction site with Charles Choi's order. Wearing a helmet, lifting a shovel to dig the ground, the movie says, \"You only call these places when you bury traitors.\" When Charles Choi\u00a0quietly scolded Goo, saying, \"I heard someone told me to watch out for my illegal activities,\" he sarcastically said, \"When other crew members were involved in illegal activities, why did you call me when they were in charge of the four-men\u00a0crew members?\"\u00a0\"When other crew members were involved in the illegal work, they stayed still.\" Then his expression gets serious and he asks if there is any weakness in the Workers.\u00a0Charles Choi\u00a0then muttered, \"This is why he shouldn't have left until he had complete control of them,\" and said, \"Who's here?\"\nLee Do-gyu, the director of Baekho Human Resources Center, appears in front of Goo\u00a0with a touch, and Goo\u00a0seems to be intimidated and ready to fight with a heated shovel.\nAlthough the battle was likely to take place, Goo\u00a0first said he was disappointed by Charles Choi,\u00a0saying, \"The jurisdiction of the four crew members is over, but why to call himself that Workers\u00a0was caught committing an illegal act?\" He said, \"I am your bodyguard.\"\u00a0Then, he called in a retired uncle who couldn't take care of his allowance, but asked if he suspected him, and mentioned that Charles Choi had a fought well when he was younger, threatening him with a \"Shall three of us should fight each other.\"\nHowever, Charles Choi, who soon gives a 100-million-dollar check as pocket money, looks surprised, but when he says that he was playing too much and tried to take care of him, he looks suspicious. What he said to himself earlier is that he took a check from Charles Choi, who is said to have been surprised, and says that it is rather surprising that Charles Choi, the world's leading figure, is reluctant to Workers. \"Be careful with Lee Do-gyu, who takes out alcohol,\" he warned, \"I'll pluck your eyes when I meet you\u00a0next time.\""

He is able to turn talentless fighters such as Olly Wang and Eli Jang into monstrous fighters in a short period of time, showcasing his educational ability. He also trained Daniel Park for one month, allowing him to completely overwhelm the Workers and prevent the destruction of Big Deal street.",
        "fighting_prowess": "See article:\nUltra Instinct\nGun has been shown consistently since the beginning to be one of the strongest characters throughout the series, and even across the entire PTJ verse. He has mastered various martial arts and skillfully integrates all of them into his all-out fighting style. His most commonly used attacks come from Yamazaki-Style Kyoukushin Karate (a collection of Kyoukushin Karate arts from all across Japan). He prefers to fight unarmed (though he is adept in using weapons such as Tonfas and Stun Batons), and tank blows head on rather than dodging them.\nAs stated by Charles Choi, his strength is \"impossible to capture\", and he is a Genius who would never stop growing stronger. This is due to the fact that he is always conscious in the Ultra Instinct state, allowing him to amp his senses and physical capabilities to the max every second, making him stronger than ever after every successive fight.\nHe was able to tank a constant onslaught of attacks from Jerry Kwon, Warren Chae, Zack Lee and Vasco- all at their strongest, and then knock em all out near-effortlessly with little to no damage sustained.\nIn the earlier part of Lookism, he triumphs over the entirety of the\n2nd Generation\nwith his strength, as none of them had been able to damage Gun seriously. This was so until the 2nd Generation got stronger.\nIn the Hunt For Big Deal arc, his mere presence alone was able to paralyze the majority of the Workers in fear. He then proceeds to defeat\nMandeok Bang\n,\nYuseong\n,\nRyuhei\nand\nMagami Kenta\nall alone, sustaining no damage.\nLater in the Hunt For Gun arc, he fought off thousands of Workers and Kagiroi with no damage, and later the Four Major Crews and their strongest fighters such as\nJake Kim\n, Eli Jang, Johan Seong and Mandeok Bang. Though sustaining a broken arm, deep lacerations on his torso, with his chest caved in, one eye rendered functionally useless and pummeled into a crater on the ground, he was still able to overwhelm all of them.\nWhen adrenaline pumps through Gun's blood, he becomes stronger than ever. It makes him unable to feel pain- allowing him to use a completely broken arm as if it were never destroyed in the first place. While fighting Johan Seong who regained his vision, he was able to tank all blows inspite of getting injured from previous fights from the crew heads.\nAnd while fighting Goo Kim, even though getting pushed back and being on the defensive, he was still able to contend with the Weapon Genius until Charles Choi's safety was compromised by James Lee, at which point his attention wavers and Goo inflicts a deep slash on his neck, which could fell any other man. Which is another testament to his blatantly superhuman endurance and will to fight.\nEventually, due to losing consciousness, Gun's body enters the unbridled 'Ultra Instinct' state, something which is implied by both Goo's and James Lee's statements, to in fact be his true nature by blood. In this form, Gun's prowess ascends to such a level that he outright outmaneuvers and overpowers even a fighter of Goo's calibre into a knockout, even when the latter had already unleashed his own full power using his 'Twin Swords Stance' and got more serious than he's ever been for a fight.\nGun being the 'Nurture Genius', also mean that he sees martial arts and fighting as a whole like an academic subject. Hence he's also privy to their tactics, strategies and weaknesses as well, especially of his students. He is in fact so knowledgeable and intuitive about all things combat, that even after being at the most weakest and physically mangled state he's ever shown to be in whilst simultaneously overwhelmed by the pain of all the injuries he incurred throughout the arc, he still tactfully overpowers 2nd Body Daniel Park, whilst the latter is in Ultra Instinct himself, capitalizing on the latter's tendency to match opponents, and eventually pummel him into total inactivity, the first person in the series to achieve such a colossal feat, though that last effort took everything out of him and left him near death.\nAll of this truly cements him as one of the absolute most powerful and complete, hand-to-hand fighting forces ever seen, and will be as such for the far future.\nQuotes\n\u201cFunny... there was a man who messed with my shades before but no one has ever messed with my hair.\u201d\n[\n8\n]\n\"It was better than... the best night I had with any woman.\"\n[\n9\n]\n\"You pleased me with your body. I should pay you for that.\"\n[\n9\n]\n\"Tell me who I need to kill.\"\n\"Good Luck.\"\n\"I don't joke around when I say I want to kill somebody.\"\nTrivia\nHe is often seen saying \"Ganbare\"(\u304c\u3093\u3070\u308c), a Japanese phrase that translates to \"good luck\". This phrase has been repeated by multiple other characters in the story who have come into contact with him.\nHe rips his shirt off whenever he gets serious during a fight.\nHe is very good at video games.\nGun has a strict level of morality/rules to himself and his successor such as not being involved in any illegal activities.\nPrevious candidates: Johan, Jake, Olly, Samuel and Eli\nPotential Candiates/Succesors: Daniel Park\nSo far, Gun has not been defeated by any of his challengers. He claimed that he let Eli go on purpose making their fight's result remain unclear. The ones who pose the highest threats include the other fighting legend,\nGoo Kim\n,\nJake Kim\n, Daniel (in an unconscious state), DG/James Lee, Gapryong Kim, Elite/Charles Choi, Jinyoung Park, Baekho Kwon, Jake Kim's Older Half brother (King of Seoul), Jichang Kwak (stated by Daniel to be on par in terms of brute force and Elite/Charles Choi even considered Jichang worthy of replacing either Goo or Gun) and Tom Lee.\nHe appears to have a history in Japan and is recognized by the Yakuza as \"White Ghost\".\nGun is implied to be Pansexual.\nGoo has stated that Gun is a \"pervert\" who doesn't concern himself with the gender of the person he is attracted to or \"hooked\" on.\nGun rewards Daniel with a clue to taking down the Workers after Daniel \"pleases him with his body\" (Daniel fought Gun).\nHe has poor handwriting.\n[\n10\n]\nHe always wears branded clothes.\nThe official Japanese game information itself stated the height is 190cm\n[\n4\n]\n[1]\n</ref>.\nGun Park has been named by the author as a member of the 1.5th generation, a group of fighters who rose before the 2nd generation but after the 1st generation.\n[\n11\n]\nGun is half Japanese and half Korean according to PTJ himself.\nGun's father\nis the Oyabun (Partriarch) of Yamazaki Clan, which makes him pure Japanese. Meaning Gun's mother is actually Korean.\nGun is not 20+ like many think. In\nEpisode 38\nhe is stated to be the same age as the seniors (who are 18-19), and one year has passed since then meaning he is now 19-20. He is more likely to be 19, however, Goo stated he would be unemployed when he turned 20,\n[\n12\n]\nso the same is likely for Gun.\nIt is revealed in the Shiro Oni arc (Gun's past arc) that he was actually born with Ultra Instinct\nIn chapter 501, Gun has been shown to have a hobby for carving wood at his residence, which is a Junkyard. The reason for this is unkown.\nIt has been confirmed by Charles Choi himself in the\nCheonliang\nand Hunt for Gun arc, that\nGun's father\nindeed was the Great Power the\nFist Gang\nfought against, even admitting that the red paper holds the proof of his betrayal and his siding with the\nYamazaki Clan\n.\nAccording to Charles himself, Gun is a being which cannot be measured, even admitting that he is a genius and a son of a legend\n(Gun's father\n), his Genius as a training genius just goes on to show that he himself keeps growing as he trains people.\nGun is a regular smoker but till date hasn't done it in front of women or Goo (after he complained about the smoke in\nJake Kim arc\n).\nReferences\n\u2191\nAccording to Gun's Namu\nWiki\n, he originally used his mother\u2019s surname, Yabuki (\u77e2\u5439), in the Japanese release. In Episode 530, he is granted the name Yamakuni (\u5c71\u56fd) by Shintaro rather than Yamazaki (\u5c71\u5d0e).\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 283: Hostel (Epilogue)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 38\nGun says he is the same age as the seniors (18-19). 1 year has passed since then.\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\n4.2\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nEpisode 310\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 281: Hostel (12)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 274: Hostel (5)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 243: Eli Jang (12)\n\u2191\n9.0\n9.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 286: Daniel Park VS Gun (2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 343: Workers(3 Affiliates) (14)\n\u2191\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ED0x2R6gMg\nAuthor's youtube\n\u2191\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/ep-231-runaway-fam-epilogue/viewer?title_no=1049&episode_no=231\nEpisode 231"

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nTen Geniuses\nGoo Kim\nLike Gun, Goo Kim is another fighting legend. The two are rivals and best friends. Their attire often consists of opposing colors (Gun wears black/grey while Goo wears white/gold), and both dress very neatly. Gun was first sent to test Goo in a fight by the HNH chairman. It was implied that Goo gave Gun the nasty scar between his eyes (and possibly multiple others) during their fight and Gun caused Goo to need steel pins somewhere in his body. Later, Gun was hired by  Crystal's father as a bodyguard for Crystal. Because Gun left the debt collecting department, Goo now has to complete it all by himself.\nCrystal Choi\nGun is Crystal's bodyguard and he often stays by her side to protect her. He is one of the few male characters who does not get smitten by Crystal's beautiful appearance (in her new body). Gun was hired by the HNH chairman to protect Crystal, and he is very protective of her.\nCharles Choi\nAs one of the ten people raised by Charles, Gun deeply respects him and always follows his orders.\nJ High School\nDaniel Park\nGun first met with Daniel when the latter tried to go after Crystal to thanked her. However, the meeting turns into a heated one because Daniel tried to touch Crystal. Gun was of course angry and tried to attack him. When Gun attacked him, he was quite impressed and called it that he had talent. When Gun meets Daniel again during the PTJ Entertainment case, he thinks that Daniel is reliable, showing that Gun recognizes his abilities. Later, when they meet again in the God Dog arc, Gun realizes that Daniel has the ability to imitate other people's movements, just like Yohan. Gun is of course happy and satisfied, because people who have such talent, apparently still exist. Gun meets Daniel again when he goes to James Lee's old school trying to find out more about James Lee. He asked to return the photo that Daniel took, but a fight broke out because Daniel did not want to give the photo. While fighting, they also argued about the Big Four Crews. However, Gun gets angrier and ends up trying to finish Daniel off for being stubborn.\nHowever, Gun then sees Daniel enter in an \"Ultra Instinct\" state. Gun, when he saw Daniel who was in that state, at first did not think it was extraordinary but changed because Daniel showed many martial arts moves that he had never learned. Gun was certainly very happy and comforted because he met someone who was able to fight commensurate with him again. After the fight is over, Gun thanks Daniel and hands him the task of wiping out the Big Four Crews.\nVasco\nGun first meets Vasco when Gun fights with Daniel. Vasco who saw that of course was disturbed. As soon as Vasco starts to move, Gun immediately punches him in the face but is then surprised that Vasco is not so affected by his fist. Gun tries to fight back again because he finds it interesting, but is blocked by Crystal. During the Illegal Toto arc, he meets Vasco again when Vasco fights Jake. He misspelled Vasco's name with \"Tabasco\". When Vasco is overwhelmed against Jake, Gun appears and judges that Vasco's \"hardware\" is very good, but there is no \"software\" in him. After Gun fights with Jake, he admits that Vasco is a strong person because Gun said that \"I won't remember weak people\".\nDuring the God Dog arc, Vasco meets Gun again and compares him with Johan, who has \"sophisticated software\" but \"very ordinary hardware\", as opposed to Vasco. Then, when Gun tries to attack Zack, Vasco protects him and then attacks Gun. Gun there realized that someone had installed \"software\" on him, where in the past he only had \"hardware\". Gun acknowledges Vasco even more because he has leadership and loyalty, just like Jake."

        "background": "Gun Park grew up in the family of the very famous and powerful leader of the\nYamazaki Syndicate\n,\nShingen Yamazaki\n, a legend comparable to\nGapryong Kim\nin Japan, in the Yamazaki family of the Yakuza mafia organization. Gun Park was one of the four children conceived by Shingen Yamazaki, the current leader of the Yamazaki syndicate after the defeat of the\nGapryong Kim's Fist Gang\n, with the goal of becoming Yamazaki's hope and taking their clan to the next level. Gun Park was originally born with reversible eyes (\nUltra Instinct\n) from a\nSomi Park\n, woman and from the Hangure clan. From an early age, under the mentorship of\nShigeaki Kojima\nand\nHiroaki Kojima\n, Gun established himself as a genius who learns with great speed, and from an early age it became known that in a month he is able to master any martial art. However, for all his merits, he did not receive a name from his father, and he was also the leader of the clan. On the instructions of his mother, in order to earn a name from his father, Gun, as an elementary school student, he forcibly captured most gangs in Japan in one day. However, Gun had a cousin\nHaruto Yamazaki\n, the son of\nShintaro Yamazaki\n, who treated him with love for his brother, and instructed him on a kind and honest path, without bloodshed, and most importantly advised him to live without relying on the expectations of others, and follow his own path. Gun Park told everything to Shintaro Yamazaki, the vice-head of the Yamazaki clan, and in order to follow all the rules of his clan, he forced Gun to kill his brother, and a little later he forced Haruto to commit Harakiri, which he did to please his father.\nHowever, at the same time, the vassals of the Yamazaki syndicate intended to overthrow and kill Shingen and his son, Gun Park, and put his brother Shintaro Yamazaki in place of the head, acting not in the interests of the clan leader, but for the sake of the Yamazaki clan itself, but Shintaro flatly rejected this idea, saying that they had condemned themselves to death. After some time, the vassals nevertheless decided to attack Shingen himself, and the sons of the vassals attacked Gun Park, Shingen's son. However, the task turned out to be a failure on both sides, the vassals and their sons lost in an unequal battle with Shingen and Gun. After these events, Gun personally met his father and asked for his name, but Shingen did not even know about the existence of Gun all this time, showed his indifference, and then personally said that Gun was not his son, which hurt and hurt Gun very much.\nSoon Gun Park arrived in Korea, in Seoul, and after a while he ended up in a juvenile colony for unknown reasons. In the juvenile colony, Gun Park came up with an individual training plan for himself to become stronger, the training consisted in the fact that all the prisoners of the prison fought against him alone. Soon after such training, Gun Park left a huge bloodstain on the wall of the Prison. Also at the time of his stay in prison, Gun Park met\nCharles Choi\n, who was working as a janitor at that time. And a year later, Charles Choi opened his own business and began to educate Gun Park as a Genius of Nurture, and also began to study with\nTom Lee\n.\nAt some point in the past, after leaving the juvenile prison, the HNH chairman sent Gun to test\nGoo Kim\n's fighting ability in order to recruit him as Gun's partner. Both fighters were infamous for their prowess, and both individuals seemed to have heard of the other before their first encounter. Though it was not explicitly shown, it can be inferred that their first fight was intense and resulted in\nGoo\ngiving Gun the scar between his eyes (and possibly more on his back and torso), while Gun caused\nGoo\nto need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments. The outcome, however, was unclear, as both fighters suffered heavy injuries. After the fight they joined forces and created the\n4 crews\n.\nGun was eventually assigned to bodyguard\nCrystal Choi\n, leaving\nGoo Kim\nto handle the business on his own much to his annoyance. They are seen meeting up together and talking about the crew heads or fighters throughout the series on different occasions.\nFestival Arc\nGun easily subdues\nDaniel Park\n(Daniel Park) with a Brazilian kick after he tries to touch Crystal. When Vasco tries to intervene, Gun beats him as well with ease. Gun later tells Daniel that it has been ages since he has fought, but he sees great talent in Daniel as well as Vasco.\nLee Euntae Arc\nGun is seen meeting Goo for the first time, having been ordered to test Goo in a duel to determine Goo's fighting capabilities by the HNH chairman.\nIllegal Gambling Arc\nGun goes to see\nJake Kim\n, the top candidate for Gun's successor. When Jake Kim knocks out Vasco without much effort, Gun intervenes, stating that because Kim provided illegal gambling, Jake disqualified himself for the position. Angered, Jake Kim expresses his distaste for Gun's shady debt collecting operation with Joon Goo. He attempts to fight Gun and take his position by force but is brutally beaten and had several of his teeth pulled out by Gun\nPTJ Entertainment Arc\nDuring the Aru nude-shoot scandal, Gun and Goo are sent by the chairman to fight the PTJ CEO's gang of men. The deadly duo effortlessly dispatches their opponents. When Goo mockingly brings up Gun's successor, Gun replies with a mocking comment on Goo's hard debt collecting job. Goo, angered, initiates a fight with Gun because Gun left him alone to complete the job. The two chaotically clash until the HNH Chairman arrives.\nGod Dog Arc\nAfter tensions rise between the God Dog crew and Vasco's Burn Knuckles, Johan was revealed to have been betrayed by his own crew members. When Johan prepares to fight Daniel Park, Vasco, Vin Jin, and Logan Lee simultaneously, Gun intervenes, stating that Johan had disqualified himself for his position by failing to integrate his own crew, let alone the four crews that Johan was supposed to unite. Outraged at his own failure, Johan attempts to fight and defeat Gun for the position. However, Gun beats Johan with relative ease. Eventually, Zack Lee steps in to defend Johan, as well as Daniel Park and Vasco. Surprised and pleased by the strong bonds of friendship within Daniel Park's group, Gun takes his leave.\nRunaway Fam Arc\nGun Park is relaxing in the sauna with\nDG\n, and after a while\nGoo Kim\ncomes in, discussing the\nHostel\nGun Park explains why the Hostel A will never be caught. In addition, Gun Park and Goo Kim competed to see who would stay in the bath longer, but when James left, Goo Kim explained why he came to the bath. In order to tell Gun Park that he came to meet his new secret friend.\nEli Jang (Arc)\nAfter the defeat of\nDarius Hong\n, Gun Park found out about it and was very surprised, in turn,\nJohan Seong\noffered to defeat\nEli Jang\n, in exchange for the fact that Gun Park would give him Kandong, Gun Park in turn agreed to look at the abilities of the hostel, and if Johan overcomes Eli Jang, then the\nGod Dog\nwill rule Kandong. A couple of days later, Johan, Gun Park, and\nJerry Kwon\nmet with\nWarren Chae\n, whom he accepted as members of\nBackdoor\n, Warren offers to fight with Jerry, whom he mistook for the boss. Watching Warren and Jerry fight, Gun Park notices that if Jerry hadn't been so stubborn and was able to block attacks, he would have become much stronger. Watching Eli Jang and Yohan fight, Gun Park notices the fact that Yohan is incredibly talented, but he is very naive and easy to betray, so Gun Park notices that this is the only trait that spoils his leadership qualities. Asking Eli Jang what makes him so desperate that he uses weapons in battle, to which he replied father will always protect his family, while pissing off Gun Park. Gun Park, having decided for himself that a\nBig Deal\nand a\nGod Dog\nwill share the kandonga, asked Jerry to pass it on to\nJake Kim\n, in turn, Gun Park will destroy the hostel alone. During the battle against the Hostel, he was surprised by their teamwork, and soon he was very amazed by the fact that someone was able to mess with his hairstyle. After defeating the Hostel, Gun Park admitted that Eli Jang is the strongest among all four gangs, but acknowledged the fact that the hostel as a gang does not stand out among the four gangs. At the moment when Gun Park wanted to make Eli Jang regret that he had defeated the Backdoor leader,\nOlly Wang\ninterrupted him, saying that they know how to make money by a cellular organization, saying that Eli Jang had invented this system, surprising Gun Park, and then calling Eli Jang the best candidate for a successor, and then left his phone number to contact him.\nHostel (Arc)\nWhile cooking soup, we were talking about\nLogan Lee\nand his strength, Gun Park says that he wanted to give him an entire district for his strength, although according to Goo Kim, he does not like him.\nGoo Kim\nsays that he is juicy on the outside and crispy on the inside, explaining that his muscles are protected by a layer of fat that absorbs all the force of the blow, saying that such a body is ideal for fights. During the training of the Gun Park, Goo Kim touched on the topic of  Eli Jang and his search, after Goo\u00a0 Kim asks what Eli Jang hooked him with, Gun Park replied that his wildness could overcome him, describing Eli Jang as a wild beast. After Olly Wang's death, Gun Park flew to Japan to express condolences on the death of\nOlly Wang\n. After it's over, Gun Park meets\nEli Jang\noutside the Hostel building with a\nYenna\nin his hands, saying that he has changed a lot. After Eli Chan's words that the Hostel is no longer a gang, after Gan Park left, saying that the big Four only poisoned the life of this man.\nDaniel Park VS Gun\nDaniel Park\ngoes back to the abandoned school, where he is met by Gun Park. Gun Park asks to return the photo to him, to which Daniel Park refuses, after which Gun Park starts a fight, trying to take the photo by force. During the fight, Gun Park offers Daniel to become his successor and create his own gang and join the ranks of the\nFour Major Crews\n. To which Daniel refuses. During the battle, Gun Park knocked Daniel out, but after that Daniel entered the Ultra Instinct, starting to fight with Gun Park on equal terms all night, but soon Daniel returned to consciousness where Gun Park thanked him for a decent fight and then provided a ONE MCN business card along with a black VVIP badge, soon Gun Park wished good luck in the overthrow of the Four Major Crews.\nWorkers (4th Affiliate)\nAlexander Hwang\nhad a phone conversation with Gun Park and\nGoo Kim\nabout the ONE MCN business card, testing his theory about who could have given\nDaniel Park\n's original body the ONE MCN business card. Some time later, Goo Kim meets with Gun Park at a bowling alley, where Goo Kim told that he met\nTom Lee\n. Goo Kim asks who would have won in a 1 on 1 fight\nSamuel Seo\nor Daniel Park, Gun Park replies that Daniel Park would have won, justifying this by saying that Samuel Seo is very cruel and not suitable for the role of successor.\nJake Kim (Arc)\nGun Park and Goo Kim came to the territory of a\nBig Deal\nto recruit a gang into the\nFour Major Crews\n, while\nSinu Han\nrecognized Goo Kim, they started a fight Gun Park watched this fight, analyzing Sinu Han's body and fighting skills Gun Park came to the conclusion that Sinu Han is strong, but not capable of being part of a big fours because of his age. During the battle, Goo Kim and Sinu Han were stopped by\nJake Kim\nand\nSamuel Seo\n, Gun Park at the same time decided that the Big Deal would be part of the Four Major Crews, passing the news to\nDG\n. Before leaving, Gun Park said that they had only passed the initial assessment, and gave them the task to earn 100 million won in 1 month, and if they did not do it, they would destroy a Big deal. A month later, Gun Park and Goo Kim visit the Big Deal again, deciding that the gang could not earn the amount they named, they decided to disband and destroy the Big Deal, but Goo Kim, noticing 100 million won, changes his mind, however, Samuel, bringing the Black Bear gang, claims that the Big Deal wants to test their abilities by setting conditions if they pass The Big Deal test will become part of the Four Major Crews and give 100 million won, but if they fail the test, they will die. After passing the test, completely destroying the Black Bear gang, Gun Park was surprised by Samuel Seo's intellectual abilities, offering him to become the leader of a Big Deal, but soon Samuel handed over this position to the\nOld Face\n. After some time, Gun Park, sitting on a bench, analyzes Samuel Seo's abilities, coming to the conclusion that starting from his business sense and ending with his fighting abilities, he is perfect in everything, making an analogy with Jake Kim and Samuel Seo, he does not understand why Samuel thinks that he is inferior to Jake Kim, coming to the conclusion that Samuel may be an illegitimate child, Gun Park decided that Samuel Seo wanted to kill Jake Kim. After some more time, during the meeting of the Gangseo's girls' strike against Samuel and the meeting of Jake Kim and Samuel, seo Gun Park finally realized that Jake Kim is the son of\nGapryong Kim\n. After the fight between Jake and Samuel, Sinu Han returned, who aimed at fighting Gun Park, but in fact Sinu Han was not going to fight Gun Park, but simply wanted to get rid of Samuel. After a while, sitting on the bench, Gun Park came to the decision to create a gang in Gangbuk, simultaneously giving the business card of the gang of\nWorkers\nto Sinu Han, for which he needed to call, and sell himself to the Workers as a high-class fighter so that the earnings of a Big Deal would be much more rapid. After a while, Jake Kim began to steadily pay 100 million won to Gun Park. However, Jake Kim promised to buy Sinu Han for 5 billion won from the Workers. At the same time, Samuel Seo asked for another chance to become the successor of Gun Park, soon he gave him a second chance and also gave him the task to become a respected person with his gang Ganseo Union in Gannam, Samuel was the first person to whom Gun Park gave a second chance. While destroying other Korean gang, Gun Park along with Goo Kim, Gun Park decided to visit Samuel, but was extremely disappointed that he was beating up his own subordinates, he realized that Samuel would never become an ideal leader, so Gun Park decided to drop Samuel. After a while, Gun Park and Goo Kim pitted all 4 leaders of the\nFour Major Crews\nto identify the strongest leader, simultaneously betting on their favorite, Gun Park and Goo Kim bet 5 billion won each and the winner will win 10 billion won. Gun Park's favorite was Jake Kim, and Goo Kim's favorite was\nOlly Wang\n. However, Samuel Seo turned out to be the winner of the fight.\nWorkers (3rd Affiliate)\nWhile conducting a dialogue with the reader, Gun Park describes\nXiaolong\n's strength, answering the question of who is stronger than him or Xiaolong, he replied that in order to find out he needs to fight him personally.

She confided in him about her dream to become a hairdresser, and the two of them slept together as well. As a result of this, Heather became pregnant.\nWhen Heather's mother came to bring her home she tried to tell Sally she didn't snitch, but Sally didn't want to hear it. She asked Olly to help her but he only made things worse, tricking her into thinking Eli wanted an abortion. Since she had nobody to confide in, she decided to go to a gynecology clinic when she suddenly went into labor. Unfortunately, she died during the incident.\nAfter Heather's death Hostel broke apart.\nHeather's mother\nblamed Eli for her death, and he lied that he told Heather to abort her baby. The remaining members of Hostel grieved her death except Olly, who did not show remorse. Eli later became a hairdresser, so he could finish Heather's dream.",

He has dark coloured eyes and his eyelashes are sometimes visible.",
        "personality": "When he first appears, he seems to be a mature camp introductory who is popular with the students. He is sometimes strict, checking bags for alcohol, cigarettes and cellphones, which aren't allowed on site. He is also reasonable, telling students that he hopes they don't hold a grudge against him for taking away prohibited items as it is a camp rule. However, this turns out to be only an act as he is actually a repeated sexual offender and that he is using a part-time job as a camp counselor so he could post pictures of female students online.",

        "history": "When Heemin was young, he realized that looks can help him get away with bad behaviour when he stole the snacks of another child, Seungpyo, and hit him. Instead of punishing Heemin, the teacher tells Seungpyo to give Heemin the snacks because Seungpyo needed to lose weight.\nLater, when he flips up the skirt of a girl as a junior school student, she doesn't get upset. As a senior in high school, a girl cheats on her boyfriend, Jaehan, with Heemin, telling him that she'll break up with Jaehan if Heemin would date her. Heemin comes to the conclusion that all girls must love him because of his attractive appearance.\nIn a later chapter, it is revealed he went to the same kindergarten or school with Daniel's stalker. Her first memory was Heemin telling her not to talk to him after making a ribbon ring for him.\nAutumn Boot Camp Arc\nZeus appears as a camp instructor. He checked bags for alcohol and cigarettes and told students to hand in cell phones.\nDaniel, in his original body, realizes that Zeus is actually a rapist and repeated sexual offender when he puts up a wanted poster in the convenience store where he works. In fact, Zeus had taken pictures of Mijin and other female students and had uploaded them online.\nZeus asks Mijin to help him put boxes into storage, when Won Bin, the other camp instructor, tackles him to the ground. Won Bin had realized something was going on when he repeatedly saw Zeus hanging around Mijin. Won Bin stole Zeus's cellphone and found out that he was taking photos of students and posting them online. Mijin, confused as to what was going on, believes Won Bin to be the pervert instead as he was holding Zeus's cellphone.\nZeus turns the tables on Won Bin, kicking him repeatedly. He then reveals the fact that he had taken the photos to Mijin. Mijin, scared, screams for help, but Zeus punches her, telling her not to play hard to get as she had allegedly flirted with him earlier. When she pleads with him to let her go, telling him that she wouldn't report him. He gets mad at her for saying so because he doesn't think he is doing anything wrong. Punching her, he tells Mijin that it was her fault for wearing revealing clothing and seducing him first, and tells her that it isn't rape.\nJin Sung\nwalks to see a crying and bleeding Mijin trying to hold Zeus off while he unbuckles her pants. Enraged, Jin Sung attacks him, only for Zeus to grab him. Jin Sung belatedly realizes that Zeus knows Muay Thai, and Zeus is able to break his ribs and both his arms. Zeus thinks he has won, but Won Bin suddenly graps Zeus's leg. Won Bin, unable to stand up, had crawled over to stop Zeus. Jin Sung punches Zeus in the face despite his broken arms. When Daniel finds Jin Sung and Mijin, they find Jin Sung out of his mind, repeatedly punching Zeus in the face.\nAs Zeus is being led away by the cops, bystanders comment that he looks too handsome to be a sexual offender and speculates about it being a false charge. Meanwhile, they laugh at the fact that Won Bin looks more like the perpetrator than the hero.\nIn prison, Zeus realizes that the leader of the prisoners is Gangnam Landlord from the Paprika TV Arc, or the stalker who assaulted Ha Neul.",

        "synopsis": "Episode 191\nDaniel\nis overwhelmed by his problems and decides to run away. He returns home to\nhis mother\nand discovers she is dating someone. Feeling like a burden he decides to live on the streets. Daniel realizes how difficult it is to be homeless.\nWhile living on the streets, Daniel hears about a famous thief called 'the Mole' who steals people's things. In the subway he falls asleep and gets his money stolen. Daniel witnesses some homeless fighting over his wallet.\nEpisode 192\nThe homeless tell Daniel that they thought someone abandoned the bag, which is now devoid of money and his phone. A homeless man takes Daniel in and feeds him soup and gives him a place to stay for the night.\nWhen Daniel wakes up, the homeless man is gone. He is found by\nMoley\nand his friends, a bunch of homeless kids who take him in. They show him how to shower and where to eat food. In a line he spots a man faking a disability and is disgusted. Moley is quick to tell him that there is no fairness on the streets. He decides to show Daniel another way to make money.\nMoley tells him there is a homeless man who embezzled money; if Daniel can grab the money and return it, the company will give him a reward. Daniel is caught by the man, who is the homeless man from earlier.\nEpisode 193\nMoley hits the homeless man and tells Daniel to run. The homeless man chases them and Daniel gets second thoughts. He stops and refuses to follow Moley. They fight for the bag and it rips, scattering the man's money. Moley tells Daniel he will get revenge and disappears. The other homeless gather the money and return it to the man, and he is brought to tears.\nThe man explains he was saving the money to buy an outfit for his daughter's wedding. He abandoned his family to avoid harassment from loan sharks. He collected money from church alms to get the amount. At the homeless man's hideout he gives Daniel some advice and tells him to return home.\nDaniel is sitting near a sewer contemplating when he is attacked by Moley, who came back for revenge. They try to steal the man's money and begin beating him. Daniel begins hallucinating and decides to run away, but is conflicted about the man. He is reminded of Duke and decides to fight Moley.\nEpisode 194\nDaniel removes his victim mentality and begins fighting Moley. He is hit with the baseball bat but knocks out his attacker and Moley. He discovers Moley is the famous thief who stole his wallet. Daniel goes with the homeless man to his daughter's wedding and they are reunited.\nDaniel returns home and looks at his friends' social media to see how they are doing. He is surprised to see that\nLogan\nis dating\nZoe\n.\nNotes\nThe man faking his disability is the same pastor from the\nCult arc\nThe quote Moley told Daniel about the world being unfair in Episode 192 is the exact same one\nJiho\ntold himself in the\njuvie arc\n.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "name": "Hostel",
        "history": "Hostel was founded by Eli Jang as a nickname for the family he created out of his orphaned friends.\n[\n1\n]\nThe name is in English and each letter represents the Korean name of his friends:\nH for Hyun (Eli)\nO for Onseok (Warren)\nS for Serim (Sally)\nT for Taenggu (Max)\nE for Eunggoo (Derrick)\nL for Lyon (Ryan the cat)\nHe gave each of the members of Hostel a role in the family: Eli was the father, Sally was the mother, Warren/Max/Derrick were uncles.\nHeather\nand\nOlly\nwere friends of Sally, but they were not given letters because they were not orphans.\nThe original purpose of Hostel was to give a home to kids without one. However, when Eli defeated the leader of\nBackdoor\nhe created a power vacuum in the region.\nJerry Kwon\nof Big Deal and\nJohan Seong\nof God Dog quarreled over the rights to the region, but\nGun\nrejected both of their cases and made Hostel into one of the 4 big crews.\n[\n2\n]\nEli Jang established the runaway family to collect money for Gun to maintain their position, but quit his job when he realized he had neglected to care for his girlfriend\nHeather\n. He then disappeared with his child and left Hostel void of leadership.\nOrganization\nHostel A follows a point organization where higher members contact lower members of the gang and not vice versa.\n[\n3\n]\nAt the bottom of the hierarchy are the runaway fams, groups of homeless children who earn money for Hostel. They usually earn it through illegal means like prostitution scams or petty theft. The use of children and teenagers to pay for Hostel's dues is why other gangs call Hostel the \"worst criminal organization.\"\nLeaders of runaway fams are called \"Dads\" or \"Moms\". They have a tattoo of a lowercase 'h' to signify their status in Hostel, and they report to executives to pay their membership fees. Leaders cannot contact their higher ups easily, so it is easy for executives to cut them off.\nThe main branch of Hostel is centered in Seoul, and has the same structure as the original Hostel. The Cheongliang branch joined Hostel A later on to earn money.\n[\n4\n]\nThe Cheongliang fam also joined Hostel A as mercenaries to get revenge on Vin Jin.\n[\n5\n]\nHostel B consists of the remaining members of the original Hostel. Max and Derrick left to earn money for a time period\n[\n6\n]\nand\nRyan\nwas adopted by Jerry Kwon.\n[\n7\n]\nWarren chose to stay to keep his promise to protect Sally and keep her company. Their motto is to give a home to the lost children of the Gangdong region and fulfill Eli Jang's original goal. There is no sophisticated organization. Instead, they refer to themselves as family members: Eli is the father (Big Daddy), Warren, Max and Derrick are uncles, Sally is the mother (Big Mama). Following the Runaway Fam Arc, Amy Lee and Natalie Cho were taken in by Hostel B, where they have jobs at a local food truck.\n[\n8\n]\nThey are treated like the children of Hostel B.\nMembers\nHostel B\nHostel A\nBig Daddy\nEli Jang\nBig Mama\nSally Park\nUncles\nWarren Chae\nMax Kang\nDerrick Jo\nOther Members\nAmy Lee\nNatalie Cho\nYenna Jang\nRyan the Cat\nBig Daddy\nOlly Wang\nExecutives\nJames Gong\nJasmine Huh\nJustin Peng\nChuck Kwak\nOther Members\nRiley Oh\nMoley\nYoung Eli Jang\nSeth Lee\nBrett Lee\nJin Jang's girlfriend\nLoyalty\nPartnership",
        "synopsis": "After his departure Hostel split into two different parties: Hostel A run by Olly Wang and Hostel B run by Sally Park. Hostel A continues to earn money for the 4 big crews using the runaway fams, while Hostel B continued its original goal of taking care of abandoned kids in Gangdong.\nThe Cheongliang Branch of Hostel was added to Hostel A later on. It was initially established by Seth Lee as an attempt to expand\nHostel A's\nreach in Seoul and earn money for his brothers. Prior to that, they were members of the now defunct\nK-House\ngang. They had two main operations at the time: a tea house which employed girls, and a gambling house that was rigged. They originally employed Jin Jang's girlfriend to begin prostitution scams in Cheongliang. However, their efforts were thwarted by\nJace Park\nand\nJohan Seong\nin their attempts to rescue the girl, who was also Jace's crush. They were since sent by\nOlly Wang\nto fight the J High kids who were on their way to Gangdong.\nWhen Sally and Warren informed Eli about Olly Wang's abuse of children, he rejoined Hostel B as their leader to take down Olly Wang.\n[\n9\n]\nHostel B accompanied J High during the battle at Gangdong, and declared war against Hostel A. Hostel A's leader ended up committing suicide during his fight with Eli Jang. Afterwards Hostel A disbanded, and their members went their separate ways. Hostel B is the only remaining faction using their original name, and maintaining their original goal.\nTrivia\nThe O in Hostel is a misspelling of Warren's original name, \"Wonseok\"\nNaming the leaders 'Dad' in the runaway fam is reflective of Olly's desire to be like Eli Jang, the original Dad of Hostel. He also gave himself a similar tattoo despite never being in the original Hostel\nGun and Goo have a point system for the four crews similar to Hostel's\nSome of members of Big Deal deemed that Hostel's members are fighters who use a dirty method, the polar opposite of Big Deal's tradition which favors fair and square fights.\nWarren got an acknowledgement from Jerry that the former will fit well in Big Deal.\nGun has ranked Hostel B as the best of the best.\n[\n10\n]\nThe Runaway Fams make reference in Episode 11 of Park Taejun's other work, My Life as a Loser.\nGallery\nEp. 149\n-Jace talking about Hostel\nEp. 170\n- Hostel members blackmailing\nEp. 198\n- Moley & his friends going to Hostel\nEp. 217\n- Moley recruting James to Hostel\nEp. 220\n- Moley's Hostel tatto\nEp. 220\n- Riley's Runaway Fam\nEp. 222\n- Olly's introduction 3\nEp. 223\n- Justin & Chuck's introduction\nEp. 228\n- Logan vs Hostel members\nEp. 228\n- Riley running with Hostel members\nEp. 229\n- Hostel's real H\nEp. 230\n- Logan sitting on Hostel members\nEp. 234\n- Warren, Max & Derreck, Sally sitting\nEp. 237\n- Everyone eating\nEp. 240\n- Hostel symbol\nEp. 240\n- Hostel symbol 2\nEp. 242\n- Hostel\nEp. 245\n- Eli & Olly with new Hostel\nEp. 249\n- Eli's Hostel\nEp. 249\n- Olly's Hostel\nEp. 249\n- Hostel A members\nEp. 258\n- Johan vs Hostel A Cheonliang Branch\nEp. 259\n- Hostel A\nEp. 259\n- Hostel B\nEp. 259\n- Seth sitting\nEp. 267\n- Hostel A\nEp. 267\n- Hostel A 2\nEp. 267\n- Hostel A Cheonliang Branch\nEp. 267\n- Hostel B\nEp. 267\n- Hostel A 3\nEp. 270\n- Eli vs Hostel A\nEp. 273\n- James watching with other Hostel members\nEp. 275\n- Hostel A headquarters\nEp. 283\n- Hostel in front of Heather's tree\nEp. 348\n- Gangdong Hostel\nEp. 348\n- Hostel waiting for the one who called them\nEp. 348\n- Hostel B Members\nEp. 401\n- Hostel & Runaway Fam\nEp. 405\n- Hostel meeting someone\nEp. 406\n- Burn Knuckles & Hostel\nEp. 459\n- Eli holding a photo\nHostel A logo\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 239: Eli Jang (8)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 243: Eli Jang (12)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 222: Runaway Fam (04)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 256: Hostel Brach (2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 267: Hostel (2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 248: Eli Jang (Epilogue)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 249: Hostel (Prologue)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 229: Runaway Fam (11)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 267: Hostel (2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 279: Hostel (10)"

        "synopsis": "Episode 266\nThis arc starts off with Eli Jang, a kid sold in an illegal adoption operation. His seller employs him in various scams to get money from the illegal adoption. Eli lives with his seller, a man he calls \"Mr. Carpenter\". He teaches him how to live on the streets and makes him behave violently towards strangers. This man is actually\nOlly Wang\n, who wants to create another version of Eli Jang, his old friend he is obsessed with. What little Eli wants the most is a family, so he obeys Olly's every command.\nWhen Eli goes to rob a store he is stopped by\nEli Jang\nfrom J high school. Little Eli snaps at Eli, and he is shocked to see the kid behaving just like he did when he was younger.\nEpisode 267\nEli brings his daughter\nYenna\nto meet\nSally\nand Warren. Sally tells Eli about Olly creating Hostel A and begs him to come back to Hostel. He refuses, because he has a daughter.\nJin Jang\nprepares for his second stage of the plan, which involves\nJasmine\n.\nAt school, Jasmine's father comes in and pleads for the kids to help find his daughter, saying someone told him they could help.\nJay\n,\nDaniel\nand\nVasco\ndecide to go to Gangdong to search for Hostel, where Jasmine ran off to.\nZack\ngoes on his own and\nVin\nand\nLogan\ngo to destroy the pictures of\nMary\nand\nZoe\n. Eli shows up later with Warren after discovering Olly is turning little Eli into a criminal.\nJin believes Eli won't show up because he has a baby to take care of. He also doesn't think\nJohan\nwill come, although\nJerry Kwon\nworries about that. Hostel A send all their men to Gangdong to confront the J High kids, who plan to destroy\nHostel\n.\nEpisode 268\nAll of the J High kids split in different directions. Vasco approaches Vin, who is torturing a kid for information. He tells him to stop being a bully and Vin gets angry and decides to fight Vasco. Logan spots Jay's motorbike and decides to steal it. He spots Logan and wants his motorbike back, so the two fight.\nZack is the first to find Jasmine, and he tells her to get ready. She tells him that she can't return home because her father sexually abuses her. Daniel interrupts them to tell Jasmine to come with him, but Zack refuses to allow him, and refuses to tell him her secret.\nJin Jang\nexplains that he spent time analyzing the J High kids. Together they are powerful enough to destroy Hostel, but their weakness is that they hate each other. He studied their pet peeves; Vasco hates bullies (Vin), Logan hates Daniel while Jay likes him, and Zack and Daniel are both very stubborn. Since they cannot agree on anything, they will end up destroying themselves.\nEpisode 269\nDaniel realizes that Zack will not decide to let him through. He decides Zack is being unreasonable and tries to sucker punch him like before, but Zack stays in place.\nVin asks Vasco if he resents him for bullying Duke. He tells Vasco that Duke deserved to be bullied because he is poor, fat and ugly, and Vasco lunges at him. He throws Vasco onto the ground and traps him in an armbar. Vin reveals to Vasco that the reason he quit wrestling is because he was a sadistic kid who liked breaking people's bones.\nVasco overpowers Vin and sends him flying with one punch. He has learned how to fight from his time in the bear family, and has taken the mother bear to be his second master.\nEpisode 270\nVasco tells Vin to apologize and he will stop, but Vin refuses. Vasco brings out the red mongkol and the two begin fighting to the death.\nIvan Park\nis watching in horror and notifies Jin Jang, who sets out to leave with Olly Wang.\nLogan decides to run over Jay, but he kicks him off the bike. It swerves and explodes, causing Logan to get pissed off. Elsewhere,\nGoo Kim\nand\nGun\ndiscuss Logan Lee, and Goo remarks that Logan's muscular build is the reason he wants him as a successor.\nJay is at a disadvantage but he does his best using Systema, a fighting technique he learned from his teacher as a child. He manages to hurt Logan enough to force him into choking Jay. Jay is about to tap out when Logan remarks he will hurt Daniel the same way. He feints like he is knocked out and grabs a red-hot exhaust pipe from his broken bike and holds it to Logan's back.\nLogan releases Jay out of the pain. He is shocked to see Jay's hands are bleeding from the heat of his weapons. Elsewhere, Warren is in shock at how good Eli's fighting skills have become under Gun's training.\nEpisode 271\nLogan is having a hard time fighting Jay due to his long range pipe attacks. He grabs his own pipe and heats it, and uses it to choke Jay. Jay retaliates and the two begin choking each other.\nHope Park\nwatches and relays this to Jin Jang, while Gun and Goo continue to talk about Logan.\nDaniel is having a tough time fighting Zack. Zack reveals the reason he returned to fighting is because he couldn't beat Logan, but he is more intimidated by Daniel. After faking out Daniel with a punch, Zack decides to let him go. Daniel calls him back to fight and he copies his exact moves, using even stronger punches like Gun's. He decides to let go of Zack the same way he let go of him, and Zack gets angry. He leaps at Daniel, who is slow to block his moves. Zack gets encouraged and says he knows what Daniel's weakness is.\nElsewhere, Jin Jang comments that nobody is there to stop him. As he says this, Johan Seong arrives in Gangdong with\nEden\nand\nMiro\n.\nEpisode 272\nOlly and the Hostel A uncles have sent someone to deal with Eli and Warren when they arrive in Gangdong. Meanwhile, Daniel and Zack continue to fight. Zack feels overwhelmed by Daniel and wonders if he is a genius, because he isn't a natural fighter like Daniel and Johan. Daniel's weakness is that he doesn't have the willpower of a fighter, and that keeps Zack fighting as long as he can.\nIn jail,\nJake Kim\nwonders how Jin Jang will fare against J High. He sent Jerry Kwon to deal with Zack and Daniel if Jin Jang needs assistance.\nEpisode 273\nVin and Vasco are approached by\nJames Gong\nand MC Pesticides, who came to fight Vin. However the two of them ignore him, so he decides to fight both of them. Logan and Jay are also fighting when they are interrupted by\nJustin Peng\nand\nChuck Kwak\n, who want to fight them when they are weak. Logan makes a deal with Jay and then knocks him out, deciding to fight them alone.\nDaniel and Zack continue to fight, and they are evenly matched. When Daniel jumps at Zack he gets hit by both Zack and Jerry Kwon, who tried to ambush him. Zack and Jerry are surprised to see Daniel stand up while unconscious, and his eyes are black like Gun's.\nEpisode 274\nZack realizes they are in a trap and tries to take Daniel home, but he knocks him out the way. Daniel begins fighting Jerry. Jerry made a promise to himself the day Jake was disqualified that he would never lose another battle, but he loses easily to Daniel. When Daniel recovers from unconsciousness, Jerry decides to fight them with boxing.\nEli and Warren come across some Hostel members who have been stealing like Olly used to. Eli feels bad about it, and Warren tries to comfort him when Darius approaches them (he was released from prison before Jiho or Jake). He attacks Eli, who defeats him easily with aikido, before being stabbed by little Eli, who Olly sent to fight him.\nEpisode 275\nDaniel and Zack lose to Jerry Kwon, who drags them to Hostel's headquarters, where everyone else is. Jin Jang explains that he set them up to be in Gangdong so he could humiliate them. The boys quickly recover and start fighting Hostel together.\nVasco expects Jace to come but he instead sends Johan to watch over the situation.

A few members of Hostel recognize Eli as the original head of Hostel. Warren and Jerry begin fighting until he is called back by Jin Jang, who wants to propose something to Warren, but Warren beats him for killing his vibe.\nThe other J High kids continue fighting but they are brutally exhausted. Olly knocks out Vasco and Jay and calls out Eli Jang, who is shocked to see Olly is happy to see him.\nEpisode 277\nWarren Chae reveals the reason he was put in an orphanage was because his father killed his mother. He fights Olly and is surprised to see Olly does not feel pain from his attacks. Eli interferes and decides to beat Olly but is stopped by his legion of homeless kids, who he orders to attack Eli. Justin and Chuck attack Daniel and Jay, and Johan decides to enter the arena.\nEpisode 278\nThe Burn Knuckles arrive at the scene to support the J High kids, but they are all beaten by Justin and Chuck.

He then goes to fight Eli Jang, but he gets run over by James Gong's bus.\nEpisode 280\nJin Jang has a flashback where he learns James plans to betray Olly because he is annoyed by him. Olly was aware of this betrayal by both of them, and asks Jin Jang to grant him one last favor: to see Eli Jang one last time.\nHostel girl then betrays Jace and reveals she is Jin Jang's girlfriend, wearing a wig. Jin Jang sent Jerry Kwon away so he wouldn't learn he is reviving his old crew called K House. Back at Sally's house, Eli confront Olly to fight him.\nEpisode 281\nWarren blocks the runaway fam from entering the fight, so Eli and Olly can fight in peace.

He is disappointed that Eli is not stronger than him, but Eli gets back up and shows Olly he is still as strong as him.\nEpisode 282\nEli and Olly continue their fight on the roof. Goo asks Gun in a different location why he favored Eli, and he mentions his reckless and wild behavior. As Olly and Eli are equally matched, Olly reflects on why he wanted to see Eli; because Eli is the first person who made him feel fear. Olly has had to pretend to feel emotions for most of his life do to his condition. But now he does not feel it, because Eli is stronger than him.\nWarren, Max and Derrick and Sally appear and Olly beats them all except for Sally. He asks her why he is unable to feel anything, and tries to hit her but Warren protects her.

He becomes overwhelmed with grief and jumps off the roof to kill himself.\nEpisode 283\nThe people who knew Olly mourn his death. Chuck and Justin scatter his ashes at a riverside and burn the money they earned from Hostel B. They ask the little Eli what he will do.

        "synopsis": "Episode 255\nThe guys and girls are on the train to Cheongliang when the girls catch the eye of a small crew in Cheongliang, who are also a bunch of perverts. They want to approach the girls but cannot because they are sitting with\nDaniel\nand\nZack\n. As they enjoy the ride Daniel realizes how much he missed not having to fight.\nIn another compartment\nJace\nand\nVasco\nare seated on the train, but in different compartments. They are on a mission to get information on Hostel's\nbranch operation in Cheongliang\n. A girl comes to sit next to Jace and offers him candy. He tries to ignore her but he eventually falls for her.\nThe train perverts make their way over and begin harassing the gang, first by spilling Coca-Cola on Zack. He gets up to fight but is reprimanded by Daniel and decides not to. They are intimidated by Vasco, who tells them to fuck off. The perverts return to their leader Matt Kang and warn him of the gangster they just met (Vasco).\nOn a pit stop Vasco gets down to eat some sausage bars. He buys two for himself and Jace, but he took a lot of time and misses the train. Jace does not notice until his seatmate points it out. He tells Vasco to not to worry about the missed train, and that he will meet him at the destination they decided. Vasco yells at him to notice that the girl he is seated with has a tattoo of an 'h' on her wrist, and is therefore a member of Hostel.\nEpisode 256\nMembers of Hostel A muse about the girl with the 'h' tattoo.\nSeth Lee\n, the head of the Cheongliang branch has just been inducted into Hostel by beating Chuck Kwak. He asks if she is experienced and\nJasmine Huh\ntells him that the girl will learn quickly because she is a runaway and desperate for a home. He wonders about the Cheongliang fam and is told that they will not interfere because they are just gangsters. They also tell him not to worry about\nBurn Knuckles\n, because there is no one smart enough to stop them.\nJace is talking to the girl with the tattoo and mentions that Hostel is in the region. He warns her to be careful, then tells her that she should keep the information secret, because no one knows it. A man in black is seated behind them and hears what they have said. It is revealed that the train perverts are headed to become a branch of Hostel in Cheongliang.\nSince Vasco missed the train, the perverts decide to pursue the girls further. One of them smells\nJoy's\nhair, and in retaliation Zack decides to smell his hair. The man punches Zack and Daniel is concerned for him. He tells Daniel not to worry, that he won't fight because he doesn't want to ruin\nMira's\nvacation. He makes Daniel promise to shave his hair if he fights. The perverts laugh and one of them hits Zack, but he takes it and decides to hold back.\nBack on the train the boys see the girls being harassed by the gangsters. One of the perverts pours soda on Mira and uses it as an excuse to touch her thighs. Zack places his own thigh there and tells Daniel to get him a razor, as he intends to fight.\nEpisode 257\nZack is about to beat the perverts when their leader intervenes and apologizes for their behavior. They take their leave and one of the perverts begins talking inappropriately about Mira. He trips over the leg of the figure in black and demands an apology. Jace tells the gangster to not bother the guy and the pervert assumes he is stupid and leaves.\nIn the train bathroom the perverts gather to talk about a photograph. Zack decides to apologize from within the stall, and the perverts accept his apology. They show him an image of Mira they took secretly, and ask what he thinks of her. He begins to beat them.\nBack at their seats the girls continue to be harassed by the perverts. The leader receives a photo of Mira from his associates and is called out by Joy for taking creepshots of girls (known in Korea as\nmolka\n). Mira,\nZoe\nand Daniel race to see what is going on, and Daniel demands to see the picture. As he is beating the perverts, Zack manages to knock over Daniel's suitcase, knocking out Little Daniel and releasing Big Daniel. The girls watch in shock as Daniel walks over to the leader and stands behind him menacingly.\nJace gets up to help stop the fight but he is stopped by the man in black. He tells the man not to worry because he can handle in a fight. The man tells him he is aware of this and reveals himself to be\nJohan Seong\n. Jace is startled and asks if he is trying to join Hostel. Johan turns the question on Jace and reveals that the tattoo on the girl's arm, exposing her as a member of\nHostel\n.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

Jiho begins gambling.\nEpisode 84\nJiho begins bragging about his luck at the gambling game. At the cafe, John asks if Jiho would like to meet his friend and introduces him to\nJake Kim\n, who asks if Jiho would like to go out to eat.

        "synopsis": "Episode 214\nJace\nis horrified to find out that\nVasco\nhas no plans for the future. He drags him around the different departments where Vasco finds out everyone has a plan for when they graduate, even the bullies.\nGordon Park comes across the principal, who is very disappointed in the chaotic behavior of the architecture students. He warns Mr. Park to get them under control or he will be fired. When he hears that\nJasmine Huh\nhas lost her wallet he decides to do a locker sweep to catch the person who stole it.\nThe architecture students are surprised Mr. Park would suspect them. Vasco does not believe any one of them is guilty, and encourages the homeroom teacher to expel the culprit if he finds them. He is shocked to find Jasmine's wallet is in his locker, and Mr. Park decides to expel him.\nEpisode 215\nJace\nsets out to prove\nVasco's\ninnocence. His suspects include everyone who was not present at the mandatory lecture that the school attended:\nZack\n,\nYui\n,\nLogan\n, Jay-Gal,\nVin\n,\nMary\nand Gordon Park. He begins collecting evidence and realizes everyone has an alibi.\nGordon Park claims he was in the room picking up a textbook. Yui went to the bathroom to wash her face and stayed in the classroom because she was sick; she also went to the nurse and got some pills. Zack claims he went on a date with Mira and heard a loud noise.\nYui also claims she heard\nDuke\nsinging, but Duke was at the lecture. Mary claims she was at the lecture and Vin claims he went to the cafeteria with Mary. Logan says he went to the nurse's office and Jay-Gal laughs like a psychopath. Jace decides that all of the suspects are lying.\nEpisode 216\nJace decides Gordon Park is lying because he was in the room and he did not leave after getting the book. Yui is lying because she was still wearing makeup despite washing her face. Zack was clearly asleep, because\nMira\nwould never ask him on a date. Logan was not in the nurse's log, so he also lied. Vin and Mary's stories contradict each other, but the cafeteria lady did confirm Vin came with a girl to the caf\u00e9.\nJace is upset and thinks he can't solve a case when he remembers his grandfather's advice: always go to the crime scene. He comes across the\nBurn Knuckles\ndestroying the place and finds a small gem. He sees a CD in the room and puts everything together. Jace goes to the homeroom teacher's office and declares the culprit.\nEpisode 217\nJace explains that Yui did go to the bathroom, but not to wash her face. Her pills were laxatives, and the noise Zack heard was her going to the toilet. She is acquitted. The singing that Yui heard was not Duke but his CD Vin listened to in the bathroom; he is also acquitted. Zack is acquitted because he was clearly asleep.\nMary is acquitted because she was at the lecture at the time. Logan claims he did it but Jay-Gal denies it, saying the reason Logan was absent was to give Zoe a picture he drew of her. He leaps out the window with Jay-Gal and the both of them are acquitted. Mr. Park is also acquitted, because Jace only saw him looking, and he did nothing more.\nThe real culprit was\nJasmine Huh\n. She lies about being rich and then placed her wallet in Vasco's locker to pretend her money was stolen. She pretended to be Mary and went with Vin to the caf\u00e9, but he didn't notice because his glasses were too dark. The last piece of evidence is the small gem from her headband she left at the crime scene. Jasmine is revealed to be a mythomaniac, a perpetual liar. Jace ends the case happy with himself, and with a bunch of new enemies.\nCookie is Gordon Park giving Jasmine her wallet with all the money in it. He placed his own money in there because he genuinely believed Jasmine lost her money, and complains that his wife will be mad.\nLater, a weirdo wearing a stocking mask tries to sell an internet caf\u00e9 computer to some strangers. When they refuse him he beats them with a keyboard and escapes the scene. He is approached by members of Hostel, and removes his mask to reveal himself as\nJames Gong\n.\nEpisode 218\nZoe\nis walking to school when a man asks to buy her spit. She runs away and the man is pursued by Logan, who beats him senseless. At school the fashion boys are shocked to hear the news, and Jace explains olfactophilia and the money it generates. Jace mentions he is looking into it because he is trying to find information about Hostel, now that\nDaniel\ndecided to go against the Big 4 crews.\nJasmine is still lying about her life and Zack is annoyed. Mira tells him the story of the boy who cried wolf and tells him to have faith in Jasmine. Jasmine takes a photo with Mira and uses it to sell spit to strangers. When one asks to see her in person, she takes Mira on a shopping trip and pretends to be her courier. She hands the spit to her client, a juvenile lawyer. They run into Zack, but he walks past them.\nJasmine takes Mira home and laughs about the scam she pulled. The lawyer grabs her face and orders her to take back her spit. Zack approaches them both and reveals he saw everything that happened.\nNotes\nThere are many references to famous detective stories in this arc\nThe title is a reference to\nKindaichi Case

        "background": "Jace and Vasco were childhood friends. When they were both young, they played with their \"Hero Man\" figurines. While playing Vasco would often question Jace about why the Hero Man would use his role as a superhero. However, despite being annoyed by these questions and hitting Vasco, both become good friends.\nAfter reaching middle school, Jace mingled with 3 other students in their class. Jace, Vasco, and the three other students meet three upperclassmen bullies. When asked to smoke, Jace was interrupted from accepting the cigarette when Vasco told him smoking was bad. Embarrassed, the three bullies starting picking on Vasco, and despite watching this all happen Jace didn't do anything, The two friends starting growing and Jace soon started to ignore Vasco's suffering. Even after witnessing Vasco crying by himself, Jace ran away. Afterwards, Vasco disappeared from school and Jace was forced to bring him back or take his place in getting bullied.\nJace saw all of the crude tattoos and wounds Vasco had received from the bullies and went to school telling the bullies Vasco was sick. This angered them and he was threatened until Vasco showed up. Vasco and the bullies started fighting but he was quickly overpowered. Jace begged the bullies to stop but all they did was beat him. Cicada, another student the bullies picked on arrived with his cousin, Goo, who preceded to beat all the bullies.\nAfter all the bullies were forced to move from the school, Jace finds out that Vasco had developed Aichmophobia, the phobia of sharp objects. To help his friend, Jace got a tattoo of a bird on his chest. Later Jace is seen to have a tattoo saying \"My Hero Man ET.\" When questioned by Vasco why he had ET tattooed, Jace replied that he really liked the movie. However, it is revealed that ET stood for Euntae, who was Jace's hero man.",
        "plot": "Jace was first introduced in Lookism as Vasco's second in command. He initially did not like Daniel Park, because he was causing trouble in J High. After seeing Daniel become interested in the Burn Knuckles, he became more accepting of him. When Daniel first began training with Vasco, Jace did not approve of Daniel because he thought he would quit soon. However, Daniel was persistent in his training and proved Jace wrong, so he started to warm up to little Daniel, even calling him a friend.\nJace and the Burn Knuckles show up a lot in the story to help Vasco in his battles. The first battle they appeared in was the Secondhand Rana arc, where they helped Vasco fight against Woojin's gang. They also attacked by the God Dogs, but they refused to fight until Vasco gave them the order. When Vasco pretended to be a runaway, Jace gathered the Burn Knuckles to look for him. They found Riley Oh instead, and he was arrested by the police.\nWhen Vasco was framed for stealing Jasmine's wallet, Jace was the one who convicted Jasmine for lying. He became interested in Hostel once he discovered people from Hostel bought Jasmine's paraphernalia and sold it to perverts. He decided to help Daniel destroy the four gangs, telling him he would need a lot more help than before. He was smart enough to challenge Jin Jang's analysis of the J High kids, and the latter marked Jace as his first target to destroy.\nJace visited Cheonliang with Vasco to gain information on Hostel, but he became distracted when he fell in love with a girl on the train. The girl was a Hostel member, and Jace feared she would be used in a prostitution scam. Vasco missed the train, but Johan offered to help Jace under the terms of a contract. The two of them found the girl, and went their separate ways. Jace reunited with Vasco and started dating the girl from the train."

Although he's been shown to have a range of expressiveness within his face, usually his eyebrows always look raised, and a calm expression.

From his introduction, he has the typical hair length of a Korean male, that is slicked to the side of his forehead. When brought back to the story in the\nJuvenile Prison Arc\n, he has an edgar-style haircut. By the end of the arc,\n[\n8\n]\nhis hair is grown out into a spiky style. However, it turns back to a buzzcut.\nHe gains a scar after fighting\nGun\nthat stretches from his cheek to his lip (in the game, he does not possess a scar).\n[\n9\n]\nHe gained another scar across his nose when he fought\nXiaolong\nin the 3rd Affiliate arc.",
        "personality": "Jake is a charming and charismatic individual who, initially, is polite to everyone he meets. He is able to win Jiho's trust easily and his accomplice Jiho mistakes him for a friend, until he reminds him that they are business partners. During the Jake Kim Arc it is revealed his disdain for gangs because of his relationship to his father whom Jake described as a gang leader known for being just and fair to others but unfair to his own family.\nDuring his middle school years he is laid back and doesn't care about being the leader of the school. Ironically, like his father he is someone who will not tolerate injustices and unfairness demonstrated when he fought the third years for \"ganging up\" on Brad and Jason when they were in middle school and fighting\nSamuel Seo\nto help the vendors of the street Big Deal is protecting.\nTo his allies, Jake is a caring leader. He fought hard to maintain Big Deal's independence, and they care about him deeply, making them one of the most loyal crews. He values people who are honest and fair, and does not like people who fight dirty.\nDuring the series Jake noted himself that he began to sound like\nSinu Han\n, the previous leader of Big Deal who showed Jake the value of \"romance\" and passion, and ideals which the latter follow.\nFollowing his time in juvenile detention, Jake's personality began to change. He became callous to his initial ideas about fairness and is only focused on revenge.\nAs of the\nOne Night II Arc\n, his sense of humor that he used to have in his past resurfaces. He makes some sneeze jokes, shows his butt to\nVivi\n, and plays word chain with\nJohan Seong\nand\nDaniel Park\nwhile on duty as an undercover bouncer for Vivi's club. However, he still has his serious demeanor at the ready whenever he needs to, as he is looking for clues regarding Sinu Han's whereabouts.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Jake Kim is among the most proficient fighters in the series utilizing a fighting style based off of MMA and his father's , Gapyrong Kim's, street fighting style. He is extremely skilled in combat and the third person to defeat\nEuntae Lee\nin the Webtoon (the others being\nDaniel\nand Gun). This is a relevant fact in the early series as it established the superiority of the\nFour Major Crews.\nAlthough it may be argued that Daniel may be faster, Jake defeated Euntae, who as Daniel stated before, was the second to visibly injure Gun. He was able to defeat\nXiaolong\n, who was comparable to Gun in strength. And, as of chapter 388, blocked a kick from Sinu, who had \"Invisible\" kicks.\nIn the Hunt for Big Deal Arc, Jake held off (for a limited time) both Yuseong (an extremely powerful figure, as the Workers\nversion\nof Gun Park) and Xiaolong (who was stated by Jake in the\nWorkers\n: 3rd Affiliate Arc [who fought Gun in a brawl] and Old Face [who witnessed Gun 3 years back] to be on par with a\nsuppressed\nGun) | but Xiaolong only got stronger from there | (as so did Gun, who trains consistently to  surpass himself every day [but hasn't engaged in many fights for a while] ), but still performed well (albeit on the losing end), and once Yuseong left, Jake adapted to Xiaolong's fighting style and ending up cornering him. A testament to his durability and endurance is that he survived a fall from a school building after taking heavy blows from the weapon wielding Xiaolong and pure destructive power (as stated by Johan) of Yuseong and still willed himself to push forward and push back the police to keep Big Deal safe.\nIn chapter 461, Taejin Cheon stated that Jake Kim was stronger than that of Jerry Kwon by the looks of the damaged and beaten responders. And in the same chapter he seems to be working with\nAllied\nin the first affiliation or is probably a member of it.\nThe full extent of his power is revealed in Chapter 469 when he faces off against\nJinyoung Park\n. After unlocking all the reserves of Gapryong's Blood/Genes, he now has both\nInnate Strength\nand completed the\nStage of Mastery\n.\nIt is theorized that his true limit was already demonstrated vs Samuel Seo in Chapter 466 but it is to be confirmed the difference between the two states: Unconscious and Conscious. There is more evidence towards the two being identical as Jake called back to the Samuel Fight and wished for the same power vs Jinyoung before being wired to activate it.\nOther Languages\nLanguage\nEnglish\nJake Kim\nKorean\n\uae40\uae30\uba85 (Gi\nmyeong Kim\n)\nJapanese\n\u8feb\u7530\u5145\u7d00 (Sakoda Mitsunori)\nChinese\n\u91d1\u57fa\u660e (J\u012bn J\u012bm\u00edng)\nQuotes\nOh, you mean they\u2019re not extras?\n[\n10\n]\nYou\u2019re not the only one with a history.

Jake is very kind to Jerry and often involved in his education he encouraged Jerry to be a modest student and to get along well with his classmates. He bought Jerry a bamboo flute so that he will not be reprimanded by his teachers and to practice the Jeongseon Arirang. Jerry is undeniably the most loyal member to Jake, he refuses to call anyone else \" Sir\" and will always follows Jake command without hesitation. He was known to be Jake's \"sword\" and when Jake lost to Gun he vowed to become stronger so that he can protect Jake.\nWorkers\nSamuel Seo\nSamuel and Jake have a rocky start, Samuel thought that Jake was acknowledged by the Big Boss of Big Deal because he personally sought Jake, whereas he was recruited by Big Deal second in command. After they were captured by Black Bear Gang where they were saved by Sinu Han the two began to acknowledge each other and become friends. When Samuel decided to go to Gangnam and start a gang there he recruited Jake to be his second in command but Jake refused, he told Samuel that he hated gangs and the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it is not a typical gang. During their conversation Jake told Samuel about his relationship with his father and his father's funeral, Samuel commented that big funerals are uncommon for most gangsters Jake told him the name of his father. Samuel was shocked and he began to despise Jake and their relationship become sour.\nWhile Jake is known to be a caring leader, Samuel is ruthless and often clashes with Jake. Especially when Samuel decided to support Old Face in joining the four major crews after Sinu lost to Gun. When he resorted on using the girls who work in clothing stores to earn money and punishing them by not giving them food or drinks, Jake decided to face him, the two fought and Samuel was left unconscious.\nDuring the fight Big Deal members as well as Gun thought that Samuel is vengeful towards Jake because he is the illegitimate son of Gapryong Kim but it was later revealed that he was jealous of Jake because he wanted to be Gapryong Kim's son. He saw a picture of his mom and Gapryong Kim together and thought that it must be his father so he changed himself from being a timid and bullied boy to a strong character so that his father would be pleased to see him when they met. When he met his real father and realized that he was just mistaken Samuel was embarrassed to admit that the \"great\" father he thought he have is far different from reality. He becomes resentful of Jake because he is the real son of Gapryong Kim and he was acknowledged by people he respect mainly Gapryong, Sinu, and Gun.\nJ High School\nJiho Park\nJake initially did not think much of Jiho. He used Jiho in his illegal betting ring and stole his money. When Jiho came to prison, Jake gave Jiho advice on how to survive. After seeing how powerful Jiho had become, Jake decided that his advice worked, and accepted Jiho into Big Deal.\nOther\nJong Gun\nGun was the one who gave Jake a scar on his face and removed his teeth. Jake has sworn revenge on Gun, and decided to do anything possible to win."

        "background": "Jake Kim used to be third in command to Big Deal, and the leader of the YB division. When the leader of Big Deal attempted to sell the gang to the Workers gang, he fought for their right to be independent. Since then, Jake has been the leader of Big Deal.\nHe also used to be the main candidate for Gun's successor, and was tasked with uniting the four crews. After he disobeyed Gun's rules by running an illegal betting ring (which, ironically, was what he was using to make money to become Gun's successor), Gun beat Jake and removed his candidacy.\nHis father, Gapryong Kim, was a famous gangster, who Jake disliked because of his father's neglectful treatment of his mother. The reason he joined Big Deal was because it was not like a typical gang.\n[\n1\n]\nHowever, his resolve and views on his father change as he learns from his mother how Gapryong was incapable of ignoring others in need or injustices. This led Jake to confront Sinu and take up the role as Big Deal's leader after the former sold himself to\nWorkers\n.\nIllegal Toto Arc\nHe,\nJiho\n, and two others met to discuss the wildly popular ladder betting game. However, he was brought into prominence when\nEuntae\n, trying to help out Jiho, attempted to fight him in order to convince him to give Jiho his money back.\nJace Park\nattempted to convince Euntae not to fight after noticing that they were in \"Big Deal\" territory. However, this confrontation angered Jake, as he was insulted that Euntae thought that he would need his underlings. Euntae and Kim immediately begin to fight, and Euntae was later shown bleeding and utterly defeated. As Bum Jae was going to step in and fight himself, Gun arrives on the scene. After being informed that he was no longer a candidate for Gun's successor, Jake reveals that Gun runs an extortion ring, which angers him. Gun then proceeds to brutally defeat Jake, ripping out his teeth as a punishment for his insubordination.\nJuvenile Prison (Arc)\nLater, Jake is shown in a Juvenile Detention Center, vowing to himself that he will kill Gun. He is a major influence to Jiho and tells him that the only way he will win against opponents stronger than himself is if he resorts to fighting to the death. He later reveals that this advice was not meant for Jiho but for himself, as he believes the only way he will win against Gun is if he fights him to the death.\nJake Kim (Arc)\nThis is a flashback arc and takes place a few years before the start of the series.\nJake is the unofficial leader of his middle school. When second year transfer students\nBrad Lee\nand\nJason Yoon\nare ganged up on by the third years, Jake steps in and beats all of the third years because he liked the gum they gave him. Later, Jake is directly contacted by the leader of\nBig Deal\n,\nSinu Han\nand is invited to join the gang. Jake refuses, stating his dislike of gangsters.\nSamuel Seo\nfinds out that Sinu contacted Jake personally and not him, and goes to beat Jake to prove his strength. Jake and Samuel fight in a street that Big Deal protects. In the middle of their fight, the Black Bear Gang shows up and threatens them. Samuel, Jake, Brad, Jason,\nJerry Kwon\nand\nAlexander Hwang\ntell the gang that they are Big Deal. The Black Bear members chase them down and capture them. Before the Black Bears can kill them, Sinu shows up to save them. He asks the leader of the Black Bears if he can handle the repercussions of killing the leader of Big Deal. He lets the boys go, and Sinu is shown visibly shaking afterwards, although the boys now have a great deal of respect for him.\nSinu celebrates saving them with a feast on the aforementioned street. Samuel is eager to join, but Jake is still reluctant to join Big Deal. He comes back later and joins along with Brad, Jason and Jerry, likely due to Sinu breaking his preconceptions of what a gangster was.\nReference\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 308"

        "synopsis": "Episode 302\nJake Kim\nis introduced as the king of C Middle School. Brad Lee and Jason Yoon are two of his juniors trying to usurp him from the throne by beating every student in their grade. However, Jake decides not to fight them, and they end up gifting him some gum. The other students come for revenge against the two, and Jake ends up saving them for the favor they did earlier. The two swear to follow Jake wherever he goes. As he's leaving the school, he runs into\nSinu Han\n, the leader of\nBig Deal\n.\nEpisode 303\nSinu asks Jake to join his gang, but Jake refuses because he hates thugs. Sinu also sent his second in command Old Face to recruit\nSamuel Seo\n, leader of the Gangseo Alliance. Jake and his crew are wandering down a street that is owned by Big Deal, and learn about the rivalry between them and the Black Bear Gang, run by adults. Samuel surrounds them with his gang and challenges Jake to a fight, saying he wants to prove who is the stronger of the two. He is jealous that Sinu acknowledged Jake and not himself. Jerry Kwon rolls up with his bicycle to join the battle.\nEpisode 304\nThe Gangseo alliance begin fighting with Jake's crew. Despite their small numbers, they are doing well for themselves. Jason Yoon is called Jeju's Crimson Stallion due to his fancy kicks, and Brad Lee is called Gangwon's Hippo because of how he locks onto opponents. They mistake Jerry for Jake's father, although Jerry is younger than Jake. None of the students want to get close to Jake and Samuel, who are throwing heavy punches at each other. Alexander tries to encourage Samuel to fight like his gangster father, and Jake mentions how he hates his father, who is also a gangster.\nAmidst the fight the Black Bear crew pull up, and order the students to stop fighting. Most of the kids flee, except Jake's friends and Samuel and Alexander. The crew asks who they are, and they say they are from Big Deal, in an effort to appear tough.\nEpisode 305\nWhen the Black Bear gang try to fight them, the kids decide to run, but they ran in the direction of the Black Bear gang's territory. They are caught and tied in the gang's pool as they interrogate them. Jason and Brad quickly confess to not being Big Deal, but the gang leader decides to kill them anyway to spare his reputation. Jake offers to go first, but before they load him into their van, Sinu Han appears to rescue them.\nEpisode 306\nSinu blackmails the leader with a Newtube video he made, explaining that he will save the kids captured by Black Bear. If Sinu doesn't return, the video will be uploaded and they will gain a reputation as child killers. When they escape from their territory, Jake and the others learn Sinu was posturing the entire time. He invites them to come eat with him.\nAlexander begins bragging that Samuel is the son of a gangster, and Jerry blurts out that Jake's father was also a gangster. Then he asks why Sinu is protecting this particular street, and he tells him the girls who work there are really pretty. Jake is angered by this and dumps his food before leaving. He remembers that his father used to cheat on his mother, and he is disappointed Sinu is like that. Samuel doesn't seem to mind, remembering that his father would say similar things.\nAs Jake sits down to think, he is approached by one of storeowners, a girl called Yeonhui. She tells Jake that he is wrong about Sinu, and that he was only joking. Sinu has been protecting her street ever since he was a child, and he usurped the previous owner so he would have the manpower to continue doing so. The people on the street came to know of him as the \"Boy of Promise\", and they pay him a fee out of their own gratitude. Jake decided to visit Big Deal once more, and along with Samuel, they became members.\nOn a rainy day, Jerry was walking back from school. He came across Johan Seong passed out in the floor, and recognizes him from the news.\nEpisode 307\nSamuel Seo is patrolling the streets after becoming Big Deal's number three. He smacks a man who forgot to wear his jacket, and Sinu isn't pleased with it. He feels that Samuel is not being a good leader, but Old Face disagrees. When Samuel comes to the clothing store, he notices that the girls are distracted. He finds them surrounding Johan, who was brought in by Jerry Kwon after he decided to make him a member of Big Deal. Samuel tells Jerry they don't have money for new members, but Jerry insists that he will let him stay until Jake complains. Johan tearfully decides to leave, and the girls complain at Samuel, saying Johan is only trying to take care of his mother. Samuel tells Johan that he needs to toughen up if he is going to survive, and he recommends stealing shoes to make quick money. Sinu gives Johan some money on the way out, and Jerry wonders if he will see him again.\nMeanwhile, Jake is accosted by Olly Wang, who is eager to join Big Deal. Jake asks Olly why he wants to join, seeing as he isn't from a poor family. Heather apologizes for him and berates Olly for joining. Jake tells Olly he might let him join some other day, as he reminds him of himself.\nThe Big Deal members decide to have some fun on the beach. Samuel asks Jake how long he plans to stay in Big Deal, as Sinu is going to retire soon. He plans to head to Gangnam later, because Big Deal is too idealistic and small to suit him. He asks Jake to come with him, but he refuses. He says the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it wasn't like the other gangs. He resented his father for not caring about his family. Samuel is curious to know who his father is, and he tells him it is Gapryong Kim. Samuel's cigar slips out of his finger, because that is the name of the man he suspects is his father.\nLate at night, Goo barges into Big Deal's store, asking if Sinu would like to join one of his four major crews. Gun is annoyed by his loudness, and Sinu is shocked and worried to see Goo.\nEpisode 308\nGoo attempts to introduce himself, but Sinu hits him and tells the others to get back, because he is much stronger than him. Goo begins fighting Sinu, but Sinu's punches are actually doing damage. Big Deal are surprised to see Sinu fighting this hard. Sinu heard from other gangs that they have been defeated by Goo as a test, and his friend Jagalchi told him that he needs to be prepared for this. Sinu tries his best, and Gun feels as though he might be able to beat Goo. Goo takes the chopsticks Sinu was eating with and sharpens them into a weapon, which he begins slashing him with. As Sinu is being beaten, Goo tries to stab him, but Jake catches his hand with the chopsticks. Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.\nEpisode 309\nGun tells Big Deal that they made the cut, and he expects a 100 million won by the end of the month. The leaders of the gang sit down to discuss their prospects. Old Face proposes using the girls to make a profit, and Jason adamantly opposes it. Jake gets up to leave the meeting, saying they shouldn't make a decision without Sinu present. Samuel also disagrees, saying he will find a way to make the money himself.\nWhen Jake goes to meet Samuel, he is standing by the lighthouse. Jake asks how he plans on making the 100 million won. Samuel tells him to get lost, because he can't stand seeing Gapryong's son. He is jealous of Jake, but he isn't aware of why.\nLater, Goo and Gun come to a warehouse to collect their dues. Jake and his crew attempt to stop them, but Goo notices that they have the money needed. Samuel tells Goo that the money is ready to be collected, and kicks it before he can count it. He tells Goo that he has to test him before he can hand him the money. Black Bear gang are upset that Gun and Goo are trying to take down their enemies, and have decided to step in to assert their dominance.\nEpisode 310\nSamuel has a flashback to when he asked the Black Bear gang to help him. He used the stores as collateral to ask for a loan of the Black Bear gang: they would pay the stores, and in return the gang would help them defeat Goo and Gun. However, he bet that Gun and Goo would defeat them, and in return he would not have to pay a cent. Gun is impressed by his foresight and wants to congratulate him, but Samuel gives Old Face the credit of the plan. Jake is disgusted by Samuel and decides to leave, reminded of his own father. The Black Bear gang eventually goes out of business.\nGoo heads to a house in a neighborhood, where he finds Charles Choi sitting on the ground with a few others. He greets the workers head, who has just managed to make a name for his gang. There is also another person in the room: James Lee, one of the ten geniuses.\nEpisode 311\nSamuel takes control of Big Deal, and orders one of his members to refuse the girls food unless they reach their quota. He asks if the others will listen to someone other than Jake, and Samuel beats him in a rage. He discusses his decision with Old Face, who agrees happily with the decision. Sinu pulls up on them and punches Old Face. He asks why Samuel has gone from being ambitious to leading with cruelty. Samuel reminds Sinu of his favoritism towards Jake, and tells him he isn't needed in Big Deal anymore. Jason and Brad prepare to leave Big Deal, but Jerry refuses to leave until Jake returns.\nSinu meets Jake at the lighthouse and tells him he has a plan to beat Gun, but Jake is skeptical. Sinu asks if he is hesitant to fight because of his father. Jake tells him he is correct, that he is trying to avoid the drama. Sinu tells him he doesn't have to join Big Deal, but he would like him to at least protect the storeowners, since he isn't strong enough to. Jake comes back to his mother's house and asks what kind of father he was. His mother confirms that he was a piece of shit, but would do his best to help those less fortunate than himself.\nJake comes back to Big Deal to find Samuel beating Jerry, who is trying to protect the girls. He tells Samuel he has never decided who the leader is, and while he dislikes fighting for passion, that he will do so regardless. Gun is sitting on a bench to watch the fight.\nEpisode 312\nSamuel has a flashback to when he first learned about his father. He created Gangseo Union so he could become a gangster like Gapryong Kim. He would follow him to  his campaigns and protect him from civilians who harassed him and were angry about his crimes. Samuel's hope was to become prominent enough to be able to approach Gapryong. When he came back from seeing Gapryong for the first time, his mother showed him his real father, an tradesman who abandoned his family a long time ago. The picture he cherished of Gapryong was taken by his real father during an outing with his mother. Gapryong also has a vasectomy, so he couldn't have children after Jake.\nSamuel was so enraged he tried to choke his father. He made himself believe Gapryong was his father, because the alternative was too painful to bear. He never did get to meet Gapryong, and he is angry that Jake has the life he dreamed of. However, his emotions make Samuel unstable in the fight, and he ends up losing to Jake. Gun congratulates Jake on his victory. Sinu arrives at that moment to show Jake how to defeat Gun\nEpisode 313\nSinu folds and reveals that there isn't a way to beat Gun; he and Jake should just surrender. Jake is livid and tells Sinu to give him the secret, but he tells him to wait. Gun has given him a card to contact the Workers, saying that if he cannot deal with the crew, it is best he sell it. He tells his plan to Old Face, and he asks the members of Big Deal to join him. Most of them do, but Jason and a few others refuse to leave Big Deal. He calls Jerry and tells him to take care of Gangdong, so he isn't present for the selling of Big Deal. Yeonhui overhears him and realizes that Sinu doesn't plan on selling Big Deal, but selling himself. Old Face and his crew decide to take down Jake on the orders of Sinu. He and the YB crew defeat them, and Jake hurries to stop Sinu from selling the crew.\nEpisode 314\nJake doesn't believe that Sinu would sell Big Deal to the Workers, but he doesn't see through the lie yet. He tries to beat Sinu into shape, but he is too easy on Sinu. He beats him proper and tells him that he did sell the crew, for 100 million won. The leader of the workers actually decided to rate him 1 billion won, for his prowess against Goo. Sinu asked to raise it to 1.2 billion won, to last them one year. Sinu continues to egg Jake on, even saying that he doesn't need the girls because Gangnam girls are more attractive. Jake tries his best now, but he is still too weak, and is knocked out by Sinu.\nSinu gives Jake his jacket, and makes his way to the Workers. Their leader tells Sinu that he will now be considered property, and no longer allowed to contact anyone. He is now No. 8 in the Workers, and his office is a giant cage.\nEpisode 315\nJake is preparing to leave Big Deal when Yeonhui gives him a recording Sinu made and never uploaded. Jake learned about the plan to gain enough money, and that Sinu expects him to defeat Gun and Goo in his place. At the monthly deposit, Gun asks Jake if he will be able to buy Sinu back, given his cost of $5 billion won. Jake tells him to be quieter, because nobody knows of this except himself and the storeowners. The storeowners offer to help buy Sinu, but Jake refuses because they are like family to Sinu. Jake hears about a gambling scheme being held in Seoul, and he begrudgingly decides to accept the position.\nSamuel is also trying to get stronger to defeat Jake. He begs Gun to give him a second chance to be his successor, and Gun tells him to make a name for himself with his Gangseo Union. Samuel decides to weed out his weaker members by beating them, hoping that Gun would be impressed by his smaller, stronger team. Gun is disgusted by his actions and beats Samuel, telling him that he still hasn't learned why he was disqualified in the first place. The Gangseo Union abandon Samuel, and he is confused as to why he wasn't accepted.\nSamuel hunts down Johan to ask him why he wasn't accepted, but Johan tells him to get lost. Jake and Olly also arrive, and both are surprised to see Samuel there. Apparently Gun summoned the crew leaders to see who is the strongest of them all.\nEpisode 316\nGun and Goo make a bet for 10 billion won on who will win. Gun bets on Gapryong's son, who is incredibly strong, and Goo bets on Olly Wang, who cannot feel pain. Johan attacks Jake first, and he is surprised that Johan is the same kid who came to Big Deal. Jake tells Johan that he is too kind to join a gang, and he should return home. Johan asks Jake to bet that whoever loses gives their territory to the winner of the fight. Olly quickly dispatches of Samuel and tries to beat the other two, but they ignore him and fight each other.\nSamuel is wondering why he lost so hard. Everyone he looked down upon is stronger than him; Johan who was a crybaby, Olly who was a loser, and Jake who he thought was beneath him. Goo goes to take a picture to show Gun who won the fight, and the scene he sees shocks him. Samuel has already beaten Johan and Jake, and he strangles Olly until he passes out. Goo asks why Samuel wants to Gun to approve of him so badly. He already approves of Samuel, and asks that he become his new secret friend.\nEpisode 317\nJake's friends begin asking about the numbers racket, and Jake refuses to tell him. He is losing money quickly, and the head of the scam slaps him and asks if he wants them to fail. He tells Jake that making money isn't easy, and he has to sacrifice something to get what he wants. Jake remembers Gun's offer to earn money by becoming his successor, and swallows his pride, deciding to continue the gambling scheme. Even though he sees the pain of the people getting scammed, he decides it is worth it if he can rescue Sinu and save Big Deal.\nWhen Vasco came to demand Jiho's money, Jake was reminded of himself. However, even his attempts to earn money were shut down when Gun disqualified himself. Jake recalls all of this as he wakes up in present time. He commanded Lineman to bring every member of Big Deal so they can attack the Workers, and force Gun to show himself to them.\nEpisode 318\nSamuel Seo, now promoted to the rank of President of the Fourth Affiliate of Workers, stops Jake and the rest of Big Deal as they are headed to confront Workers. The current generation of Big Deal members reveal that he is still renown for outsmarted Gun and Goo back when he was still a member. Samuel and Jake engage in witty banter as Samuel suggests they abandon their ideology of passion and join Workers and tells Jake to start working smarter rather than harder. The two continue to converse casually as they engage in a violent exchange of fists. Samuel claims that it is ridiculous to even consider attacking Workers, as that will only help Gun. He then asserts that the Big Four Crews were created as a means to an end, simply to provide the funds for someone's business. Now that someone wants the crews to disappear as they have begun to attract too much attention to themselves, mostly due to Daniel's movements against the crews. Samuel postulates that Gun has received an order to wipe out the crews, especially Workers, since they are aware of the only weakness of \"that mysterious person\", presumably Charles Choi. Samuel Seo then offers an alliance with Big Deal. Jake then moves towards the car, asserting that he should finally be able to meet the elusive head of Workers if he is here to form an alliance, and the shadowed face of the head is revealed within the car as Jake Kim peers through the open window.\nDaniel Park is doing better for himself as he has continued to stream with Kwitch. His self-esteem is higher and his living conditions have improved. As he is streaming within his home, he absentmindedly asks his viewers if they have heard anything about the four major something, eluding to the Big Four Crews. As he ponders when he will finally get rid of the crews, the Chairman of H Group, Jay's dad, and his subordinates approach his neighborhood.\nEpisode 319\nJake Kim announces to Big Deal that he is forming an alliance with the Workers. He tells them that they need to ally with the Workers in order to defeat Gun, but he hides the fact that Sinu did not betray Big Deal. He changes into a new outfit to infiltrate the Workers by himself.\nDaniel tells Steve Hong that Gun and Goo are the two responsible for forming the four major crews, and that the four crews are comprised of minors. Hong offers Daniel an alliance to defeat the crews by offering him money, but Daniel is skeptical and refuses him. Then Hong offers him the chance to change his life, and the location of the third affiliate: Club Vivi. Daniel dresses up using Jay's clothing to enter the club, but he is rejected due to his looks. As he sits with the other rejected members of the club, they see Xialong carrying Vivi into the club, with the guards bowing before them. Daniel recognizes that the guards are wearing gold badges of the Workers. He returns to tell Hong that he was blocked from entering due to discrimination. Hong tells Sophia to make Daniel lose 90lbs by any means possible.\nTom Lee enters a bar to speak with the chairman of Workers, who is calling from a cell phone elsewhere. The chairman tells him to send his men back to the Workers, and Tom says his company only works for payment, mentioning Choi's offer of a new building. The chairman offers him even more money than Choi, so Tom decides to send an intern (Johan Seong) to the third affiliate.\nNotes\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "name": "James Gong (\uacf5\uc601\ud6c8 Gong Yeong Hun)",
        "appearance": "James Gong is a relatively medium-height teenager that sports a white and yellow jacket, blue jeans and pink, blue, and black high-tops. He has black, unkempt hair and pale skin. He smokes during most of his panels and is implied to be a crazy person.",
        "personality": "James Gong is a rebellious teenager who tends to act before he thinks. He is classified as a gangster and is part of a group most of the time. It is implied he enjoys breaking the law.According to Jiho, when they were in middle school, James was known as a troublemaker as he got expelled for starting a fire with schoolbooks.",
        "relationships": "Jasmine Huh\nJasmine is one of his love interests. While he doesn't seem to show romantic interest in her, she daydreams about him when she is with Hostel.\nJiho Park\nInitially, James is friendly to Jiho and befriends him. Jiho begins to trust James, and makes him a bank account under his name. James later betrays Jiho by selling the account, causing Jiho to cut off connections with him.\nHowever, Jiho's attempt to get revenge on James with a box cutter causes Daniel to intervene, leading Jiho to get angry and push them both out of a fifth-story window. His arrest directly after this leads to him going to juvenile prison on the charge of attempted murder.",
        "synopsis": "Fake Bank Account\nJames Gong is introduced after\nJiho\ngoes to the ATM and smokes while sitting down on the Bank Withdrawal.\nHe then spots Jiho walking outside as soon as possible before he immediately recognizes him after Jiho forgot to get his withdrawn money back as James takes it and thought that Ji Ho himself had gotten money for him.\nHe only wanted to be friends with Jiho only to borrow money from his account,\nHe later spots James and his friends outside a bar, asking Jiho if he wanted to drink beer.\nJiho creates a bank account for him as a gift, which James then sells to pay debt, which leads to the account being used for scamming.\nAfter the Bank Fiasco, James as well as\nDaniel\ngot pushed from the 5-story building from Jiho, because of his jealousy for Daniel, and for his anger that James wouldn't pay him back.\nRunaway Fam Arc\nJames is later seen hanging around with The Mole Family, the one Daniel saw before. Sammy and Gerry began a 'reform stream', where they were going to turn criminals for good. The camera fell and it is implied by the punching that the stream failed. James then steals the camera and their car, plus a claw machine with dolls in it.\nSoon later, he then stole food from a funeral home along with a commission box. Jasmine however managed to get him away unsuspected. Later, he and The Mole went to the building where the main Uncles and Big Daddy was. He however ignored any sign of precaution and honked until\nOlly Wang\njumped and attacked him. James was then assumed to sign for the 3rd Uncle and was set to fight Chuck Kwak and won with tactics and a brick. James then earned the role though was unaware of it and was offered a phone. However James decided to steal all the phones and drive away. He then met\nZack Lee\nonce again though he was punched in the face and got his cigarette stolen. He finally returned in a bus enraged by Zack to the point where he wants to kill him. He tried to drive Zack over but that failed due to Daniel shoving Zack out of the way and\nJay\nsaving Daniel. James then tried to smash Zack's head in with the sledgehammer but failed due to Jay using a helmet to protect his head and then using it on James' head and hitting it multiple times. James then gave up and drove away, not before telling Zack that he promises to kill him.",
        "fighting_prowess": "James does not have a specific martial art ability, but has shown to impress Hostel leader Olly Wang through his \"creativity.\" He has often used cheap tricks to win a fight as using nearby weapons to surprise his opponents. James also has impressive strength as shown when he was able to knock back Hostel Uncle Chuck Kwak a considerable distance with his left hand (specifically his middle finger). James finally displays an unnatural endurance given his ability to survive beatings from Jay and Zack Lee while getting up.\nQuotes\nTBA\nTrivia\nTBA\nGallery\nFake Bank Account\nEp. 163\n- James smoking on ATM\nEp. 163\n- Jiho helps James with his bank problem\nEp. 163\n- James burning books\nEp. 163\n- James with his friends\nEp. 164\n- Everyone hanging around\nEp. 164\n- Gapseong tells James to stop pissing on lamp post\nEp. 165\n- James playing\nEp. 166\n- James and his friends hanging out\nEp. 166\n- Jiho's flashback 2\nEp. 167\n- Jame's flashback\nEp. 171\n- Daniel falling with James\nDaniel Park's Death\nEp. 172\n- Daniel Park's Death\nEp. 173\n- James prison record\nThe Truth Behind Daniel Park\nEp. 176\n- Daniel's flashback\nEp. 177\n- Jiho's Lawyer makes a story for Jiho\nVasco's Blind Date\nEp. 178\n- Story Flashback 1\nJuvenile Prison Arc\nEp. 184\n- Jiho having mental breakdaown\nDaniel Park Arc\nEp. 190\n- Danel's flashback 2\nGod Dog Arc\nEp. 212\n- Daniel's flashback 2\nJacedaichi Case Files Arc\nEp. 217\n- James counting money\nRunaway Fam Arc\nEp. 220\n- James\nEp. 222\n- Moley's Fam acting\nEp. 223\n- Crazy James\nEp. 224\n- James beside phones\nEp. 225\n- James at the hideout\nEp. 229\n- James driving a bus\nEp. 230\n- Chuck, James & Justin ready to fight\nEp. 231\n- Jasmine & James on roof\nEli Jang (Arc)\nEp. 249\n- Olly's Hostel\nEp. 249\n- Hostel A members\nJin Jang's Analysis Arc\nEp. 254\n- Hostel making a move\nHostel Branch Arc\nEp. 256\n- James asleep\nOne Night\nEp. 260\n- Jasmine taking care of James\nEp. 263\n- James & Jasmine on a bike\nJuvenile Prison Jiho Park Arc\nEp. 264\n- Jiho's flashback\nHostel (Arc)\nEp. 267\n- Hostel A 2\nEp. 272\n- Hostel A in a bus\nEp. 273\n- James watching with other Hostel members\nEp. 277\n- Olly's flashback\nEp. 279\n- James flashback\nEp. 280\n- James looking at Eli Jang's\nEp. 283\n- Big Daddy James\nJames Lee (Arc)\nEp. 354\n- Jiho's flashback\nEp. 358\n- Jiho's flashback\nEp. 359\n- Daniel's flashback\nOne Night III\nEp. 369\n- Jiho's flashback\nJiho's Last Moment\nEp. 371\n- Jiho's flashback\nReferences\n\u2191\n[1]\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nMinor Character Navigation\nAdults\nAru Lee\n\u2022\nBrekdak\n\u2022\nDaniel's mother\n\u2022\nDaniel's Manager\n\u2022\nJohan's mother\n\u2022\nLasol\n\u2022\nOliver Jang\nMinors\nWoojin\n\u2022\nDaehoon Shin\n\u2022\nSeonong Ham\n\u2022\nSoomi\n\u2022\nStalker Girl\n\u2022\nTikTacTok Girl\n\u2022\nWally Lee\n\u2022\nYenna Jang\n\u2022\nYeonhui\n\u2022\nYong Lee\nAnimals\nEnu\n\u2022\nEden\n\u2022\nMiro\n\u2022\nRyan the Cat"

        "synopsis": "Episode 354\nZack\nand\nVasco\nask\nDaniel\nwhy he disappeared with the Workers, and he is saved by\nZoe\ntelling him the teacher wants to see him. The teacher tells him that a student will come to the class, and it may cause issues in the class.\nHostel\nask\nJustin Peng\nand\nChuck Kwak\nwhy they let Workers get away with using\nOlly's name\nfor their meeting. Justin and Chuck apologize to Hostel for saying it was their fault Olly died, and that they run illegal errands for\nthe Workers\nnow. They wanted to meet with Hostel because they suspect that Olly Wang died partly because of the pills he was taking, pills they suspect came from the Workers. They offer to work as double agents to fill Hostel in on what is going on inside the Workers.\nAt Gangseo,\nJake\ntells the highest members of\nBig Deal\nto not mess with Workers, and to relay that to the lower members.\nBrad\nasks Jake why they would work with such an immoral organization, and he apologizes for being a bad leader.\nJerry\nasks Jake not to lie to them anymore, and that they want to share the burden Jake is holding on to. Jake decides to tell them the truth about\nSinu\n.\nAt the school, Zoe and\nMira\nask Daniel why the teacher wanted to see him. Just then\nthe teacher\nannounces that a student will be coming in the class, that student being\nJiho Park\n. He is on leave because his grandmother died, and he wanted to apologize to Daniel during his break.\nEpisode 355\nJiho\napologizes to\nDaniel\nfor pushing him, blaming it on his insecurities. Before Daniel can get angry,\nthe teacher\nthanks Jiho and tells the class he will be returning to prison shortly afterwards. Daniel wonders if Jiho has truly changed. As they are stepping out, Jiho asks the prison guard if he can use the bathroom. He runs into some old bullies from school, who harass him before he beats them and locks them in a stall. While he is washing his hands of their blood, Daniel approaches and asks him if he is truly sorry for what he did. Jiho tells him he would have been sorry if it were Daniel, but that he is not sorry for\nJames Lee\nthat was pushed. Driving back from school, the officer tells Jiho he will take him straight home. Jiho asks if he can meet someone and the officer obliges, saying he should make the most of his time outside of jail.\nAt the\nWorkers's\nheadquarters, Daniel asks\nEugene\nwhen he can enter the second affiliate, but Eugene doesn't trust him yet. He upholds his end of the bargain and tells Daniel the story of James Lee and the History of Fists. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.\nJiho approaches\nBig Deal\nand asks to see\nJake\n. One of the gangsters looks down on him, so he stabs him in the eye with the man's cigarette. Jake comes out with the commotion and asks if Jiho did that. Jiho says he kept his promise to Jake, and Jake asks him again.\nEpisode 356\nJiho\ntells him he did that and\nJake\nslaps him, saying that the guy he attacked was weaker than him. Jiho tells Jake that he knows the reason he held onto him was so he could destroy the four crews. Jiho tells Jake that he has gotten help from\nJames Lee\nof the first generation, and Jake tells him not to disappoint him. Jiho calls his officer saying he has nobody left to call.\nAt Gangnam,\nGoo\nand\nGun\nare partying in costumes. Goo recalls that they used to party like that in Ansan as well, and Gun asks about the Ansan kids, who may have been a crew if they were in Seoul. In the Jung-gu district of Seoul, the\nAnsan Public\ngang arrive looking for James Lee. They enter a club and are unimpressed, except for\nJacky\nwho does not care. They chastise the girls, which brings the club owners running.\nHudson\nexplains that their club is terrible, and Jacky offers to teach the owners how to run a club. The men get offended and start fighting, but the Ansan crew defeats them easily. A newcomer arrives, and the Ansan crew welcomes James Lee.\nEpisode 357\nDarius\nkisses Hudson's hand and he realizes that his voice doesn't match the one on the phone.\nJacky\nleaps on Darius's shoulders and asks if he can deal with the imposter and\nEthan Hwang\nbarges in, saying that they are looking for a leader. Darius explains that he works for\nJames Lee\nand is representing him in his absence. He says James Lee wants to unite the crews, and he wants to team up with\nAnsan\nto do it. The team find is amusing, and give Darius three conditions: first, that they decide where to start the crew business. Second, that they take 50% of the profits. Third, that they get half of Seoul, since they are seniors of the first generation. Darius is unhappy with the deal but Ethan reminds him that Ansan and other crews are not at the same level as Seoul crews.\nJacky tries to lure runaways in Gangdong but\nMax\nand\nDerrick\nthreaten to fight him.\nChanning\ncomes to the Architecture department at\nJ High\nand asks to see\nVasco\n.\nThe Burn Knuckles\napologize for any misdoings he may have done and welcome him, but Channing only wants to see Vasco. He beats them and tattooes their bodies so Vasco will come.\nHudson\nconfronts\nJohan\nwalking his dogs and asks him to give Gangbuk to him.\nEpisode 358\nJohan tells Hudson he can have Gangbuk if he wants. He went to a doctor earlier who told him he was losing his eyesight in the same manner as his mother, and he should not exploit them. If he doesn't find treatment, he will go blind permanently.\nJiho asks the prison guard is he's heard of James Lee before, and the guard finds it amusing. He says it doesn't matter since he is going back to prison, and laments that he did not get to go to the funeral of his grandmother. Jiho admits to the prison cop that he lied about his grandmother's death: he got his friends to fake the paperwork. Darius blocks the windshield of the car and leaps off just before the prison guard drives into a truck. Jiho steps out and tells the prison guard he didn't do anything wrong, so he doesn't deserve to go back to prison.\nHudson has finished clearing out another karaoke club, one that he finds decent enough to run. The rest of Ansan Public arrive, waiting for James Lee to arrive. Jiho arrives with Darius and Ethan, calling himself James Lee.\nDaniel is hanging out in DG's club that he owns. Daniel asks if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee.\nEpisode 359\nDaniel asks how he knows about the two bodies, and DG tells he's known since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.\nDG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by\nGapryong Kim\n, who was known as the \"Legendary Fist\". The crews at this time were called \"fists\", and the crew heads were called \"bosses\", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called \"circles\". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of\nCharles Choi's\ngeniuses\n, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.\nAfter announcing himself, Channing picks up Jiho and threatens to draw on him, and Jiho threatens to stab his eye with a toothpick. Jacky calms them down and Jiho tells Ansan Public that they need to stop pretending they care about James Lee, when they're only using his name as a reason to advance into Seoul territory. Hudson gives Jiho a score of 100 points and decides to listen to his offer. Jiho says he wants to start a crew called \"James Lee\". He can fill the members with Backdoor if Ansan will take care of the finances. Ansan reveals they want to start a private bar recruiting runaway kids from Gangdong. Channing will take care of the police and Jacky will take care of the workers. Jiho accepts and the James Lee crew is formed.\nAt J High, the students are discussing the news that Jiho was in an accident and escaped. Daniel and Zack talk about it when Eli comes in and annoucnes that Max and Derrick were attacked from James Lee, a guy who\nMr. Carpenter\nknows well. Daniel mentions that Jiho might be involved in this matter, and Zack says if Jiho is involved, they also have to get involved.\nEugene in his hot ride calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.\nNotes\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "synopsis": "Episode 110\nJiho\nhad just gotten his mom to buy him a new Vibe limited edition backpack, and his friends were fawning over it. However, when Jiho was with\nJay\nand\nDaniel,\nthe girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Jiho thought it is because Jay and Daniel both had a lot of money to buy expensive clothes and silently berates them for not having to work hard to get expensive goods, even though his mother had bought him the backpack.\nAll of a sudden, Jiho notices that Jay had forgotten his wallet when he rushed over to Daniel's seat when Daniel said he didn't know how to do a problem. Jiho comments on how Jay's so good to Daniel it's ridiculous, running to him just because Daniel had called. Jiho is about to call out to Jay to tell him about his wallet, but decides to pocket it instead to play a prank on Jay.\nJiho, Jay and Daniel are later at the convenience store, and Jiho's thanking Jay for buying him a lot of snacks. Jay waves at him while Daniel translates that Jay's telling him it's fine and for him to eat up. The lady at the counter tells them it's 21500 won. When Jay reaches into his jacket to pay for the snacks, Jiho looks on expectantly, thinking he'll look ridiculous when he realizes his wallet's gone. However, Jay takes out his cell phone and pays with it instead. Jay and Daniel bow to the sales lady and leave.\nLater, in the washroom, Jiho huffs, saying that it's no fun and that, if he had known, he would have just given Jay the wallet. He opens Jay's wallet to find pictures of\nEnu\nand an American Express credit card, which Jiho mistakenly thinks is a VIP card for a coffee shop. He then sees a 10 million won check in the wallet. Scared, he realizes he's landed himself in big trouble.\nHe then resolves to go and return the wallet to Jay, say he's just found it, and apologize, but decides to go and sneakily return it to Jay instead so Jay wouldn't know.\nJiho first tries to stick it in Jay's left pant pocket while walking past Jay. However, when he sneaks up to Jay, Jay sees three bees and hits them out of the air because Jay's scared of bugs. Jiho, after witnessing Jay's reflexes, decides to try another plan instead.\nHe then tries to put it in Jay's backpack after school is out. However, no matter how hard Jiho pulled on it, it wouldn't open. When Jay comes along, Jiho realizes it has a fingerprint lock.\nJiho then tries to catch Jay when he's leaving school, apologize, and return the wallet to him, only to have Jay rush away on a motorcycle.\nAs Jiho walks back home, he resignedly wonders how he can contact Jay again because he doesn't know Jay's phone number. After all, it's 10 million won. Then, Jiho realizes that all he has to do is put the wallet in Jay's desk. However, just as he realizes it, a trio of bullies come and forces him to exchange backpacks. Jiho belatedly realizes that Jay's wallet, containing the 10 million won, was still in the backpack they had stolen.\nEpisode 111\nJiho rushes to the convenience store where original Daniel works, and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that, although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow. Daniel then returns to the bullies with his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him. New Daniel then takes Jiho to Jay's home. They then see\nJoy,\nJay's younger sister. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she's come over to play. Joy then tells them Jay's just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. Jay's answer is very frenzied, and Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and says it's not like her brother to do so. She then tells them Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel immediately begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl. He decides that it would be fine if he just threw the wallet inside of Jay's bedroom.\nHowever, when Jiho opened the door, he saw Enu's pups inside, barking at him and telling him to leave because they thought he was a thief. They jump at him, biting him. Jiho flings them to the ground and throws the wallet at them, only to infuriate Enu for bullying her children. Enu starts to attack him.\nMeanwhile, Joy greets Jay as he gets home. He's sweaty from running, panting and holding a plastic bag. She tells him she's come over to play and asks where he's been. Daniel explains that Jiho's come as well, and that, if Daniel had known earlier, he would have told Jay he was coming beforehand. Jay, seeing Daniel, immediately starts cleaning the room, while Joy tells him it's already clean. Jiho walks out, clutching at his arm and limping, his clothes ripped. Enu barks from behind, saying that she'd caught a thief. That's when Jiho sees the bag Jay is holding, which is full of 10 million won checks. Daniel says that he didn't know Jay had gone out collecting the checks, and that Daniel had a lot of them too. It turns out that the checks were just pamphlets promoting the online clothes shop that Daniel poses for, and Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho realizes that all his work was for nothing and faints.\nCookie 1\nThe day before, Jay was walking through the streets when he receives a pamphlet for the clothing store that Daniel works for. People were throwing them away when they realized they weren't checks. When Jay puts Daniel's picture in his wallet, he smiles.\nCookie 2\nVasco & Daniel are seen running in the park, after a while they take a break and Vasco comments on how strong willed Daniel is to lose weight, but questions why he's not losing any weight after 3 months.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "synopsis": "Episode 19\nThis arc starts with Namsoo, a boy who is middle class. Namsoo is obsessed with wealth, and tries to impress the rich kids in the fashion department. He is jealous of\nDaniel\nuntil he learns that Daniel is not very fashionable. Namsoo decides to prove Daniel is poor, and that's why his clothing is poor.\nThe\nBurn Knuckles\nask\nJace\nwhat to do about\nVasco's\ndefeat. He tells them to wait and they grow impatient with him.\nJay\noverhears the rumors that Daniel is poor and grows concerned.\nEpisode 20\nThe next day Jay is surprised to see Daniel greet him, but Daniel thinks Jay is a good person for trying to stop his fight with\nZack\n. He overhears Daniel talking about his birthday tomorrow. The Burn Knuckles and the class rich kids make plans to humiliate Daniel.\nAs Daniel is walking home he runs into Jay, who gives him clothing for his birthday. Daniel is surprised Jay remembered and only accepts the gift when he tells him he doesn't need the clothes. In another alleyway, the Burn Knuckles lay defeated by Jay, and they wonder who he really is.\nNamsoo and the rich kids are waiting to expose Daniel when he walks in wearing Jay's expensive clothing. The other kids remark about his old wallet and he mentions it is from his mother. Namsoo is shocked to see Daniel can carry unfashionable items and not care about it. Daniel tries to greet Jay but he doesn't respond, so he keeps moving. Jay smiles shyly to himself in his seat.\nJay has a flashback to the night before he gave the clothes to Daniel. He struggled to write a letter to him asking to be his friend. In the end, he decided against the letter and simply wrote \"Happy Bday\".\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

His dyed long blonde bangs cover his eyes in all circumstances even when he faces strong wind, when he's turned upside down, to the point they never were shown since the beginning of the series. He is always dressed fashionably in high-end brand clothing and wears a variety of Chrome Heart rings on his fingers. He rides a motorcycle to school and carries a custom finger-print bag with him that contains a gun.",
        "personality": "Jay is an extremely quiet person who is shown to never speak, making it impossible for other characters, except his relatives and (Big & Little) Daniel Park and Vasco, to understand him.  He is shown to be a strong fighter trained in Systema and Kali Arnis although he doesn't engage in fights without reason.\nHe is very notably drawn towards Daniel, to the point where his whole world rotates around his presence: Daniel is the only person that makes Jay exit his bubble to the point that almost all the interactions Jay has are with Daniel. He is shown to be morose whenever Daniel disappears in the story and is ready to help Daniel at any time with whatever he would need, ask, etc.\nHe is very generous, kind and observant, to Daniel particularly, as well as some other people.",
        "history": "Although not many elements of Jay's history were revealed, he is the son of billionaire\nSteve Hong\n, which makes him the younger brother of\nKitae Hong\nand the older brother of\nJoy Hong\n. However, his relationship with his family isn't great: throughout the series, he is shown to be kept away from family events, being asked by his father to never call him again (after Steve Hong became aware that Jay was involved in a street fight), etc. The only family member he seems to have a good relationship with is Joy, who is often shown hanging out with him.\nWe also know that until Daniel's arrival at J High School, Jay was a very isolated student who never interacted with anybody norseemed interested in doing so. Since then, Jay opened up a lot, mostly to Daniel, whom he seemsto love more than anybody else, but also to a few other persons (\nVasco\n,\nZack Lee\n, etc).\nIn the more recent chapters, hoping to find\nDaniel\n(whose second body was kidnapped by Workers), Jay went back to\nSophia\n, his father's bodyguard, to complete his training, which he dropped out of priorly due to the harshness of the training. He then joined the\nAllied\ncrew, for the same reason.",
        "fighting_prowess": "While having not actively participated in a breadth of fights, Jay has proven to be a very proficient and deadly martial artist. Jay is versed in 2 different martial arts: Systema and Arnis. Systema is a Russian martial art taught by and to special forces for the express purpose of killing or disabling enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible. In fact, Jay often has to put a motorcycle helmet on his opponents to make sure he can't kill them. Arnis is a Filipino martial art with a great emphasis on using weapons such as tonfas, staves, and karambits, along with a supplementary education in unarmed combat. With this martial art, Jay often demonstrates his skills utilizing BB guns\n[\n3\n]\nbut has also attacked utilizing burning steel pipes, showing an ability to work with ad-hoc and makeshift weapons. Using these two martial arts in combination, he was able to overwhelm Scott Kwon, Dominic Min, and Jihan Kwak, more recently and after completing his training with Sophia Alexander.\nAside from that, Jay has demonstrated a strong tenacity and physicality. This is exhibited with him having endured burning his own hands to fight utilizing steel pipes and struggling against Logan Lee's submissions despite Logan's physical strength and endurance. He has shown himself to be very quick when it comes to hand speed, striking an uncountable number of times when having taken hold of his opponent,with James Gong noting that in in flurry that Jay could have \"killed him 7 times\" and being fast enough to counter Logan's natural durability, causing him actually to feel pain through his layer of fat.\nTrivia\nJay is modeled after Aboki model Hong Jay.\nHe has a fear of bugs.\n[\n4\n]\nHe also had a fear of dogs\n[\n5\n]\n, but he overcame it.\n[\n6\n]\nWhen he takes a picture, he usually makes a scared expression.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nThe penname of his Paprika TV account is 'asdf'. In Chapter 29, he used his account to compete with Lala on who could give the most balloons to the stream of Duke and Daniel.\nJay dreams to be a doctor because of Daniel (who was hospitalized at some point in the series).\n[\n9\n]\nJay used to smoke but quit in Ep. 38 when a passing student told him that he won't get a lover if he does.\nHe is academically strong and was the #1 student in his class until Daniel Park surpassed him during the midterms arc. He is shown to have a stack of study textbooks and papers on his desk while everyone else in his class messed around.\nReferences\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 49\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 110\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 69\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 70\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 139\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 140\n\u2191\nEpisode 214: Vasco's Crisis"

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nFamily\nJoy Hong\nJoy is Jay's younger sister by a year. They have a close relationship, although they live apart.\nKitae Hong\nKitae is Jay's older brother. Their relationship isn't exactly clear, but they seem to be on neutral terms, as Kitae refers to him as \"dude\" and talks to him casually.\nSteve Hong\nThe H Group Chairman is Jay's father. They seem to have a strained relationship with each other. The chairman does not approve of Jay getting into trouble, which is why he hired a butler to help keep him from getting into fights and bad situations. During the \"Runaway Fam\" arc, they meet up and the chairman tells Jay to never call him again.\nJ High School\nDaniel Park\nNew Body\nJay is considered to be the closest with Daniel's new body. During the earlier episodes, he gave Daniel a bag of new clothes when he saw the Daniel didn't have a lot. He also took it upon himself to raise the puppies Daniel had despite being afraid of dogs. Later in the series, Jay's deep care for Daniel is being shown at almost all of Jay's appearances on the webtoon. He will, for example, when Daniel's new body was in a coma, spend so much time in the hospital by his side to try and help him awakening, than a nurse will say to Daniel, when he does awaken, that Jay \"basically lived there\" during the three weeks of his coma, studying medecine in hope to find way to help him.\nMore recently, he even went as far as to join the crew that Daniel Park created with his original body (even though Jay doesn't like to fight at all), in hopes to find Daniel's 2nd body that's missing since he was kidnapped by the Workers. He was stated to have been appearing \"down\" ever since the Daniel he knows (2nd body) disappeared.\nJay gifts Daniel on his birthday.\nOld Body\nJay has a good relationship with Daniel's old body. He went out of his way to fight\nLogan Lee\nfor getting Daniel's \"lucky charm\" or the 5000 won bill back. When Daniel and his mother goes to the department store to return the dress Daniel bought as a gift for his mother as it had a stain, they refused to change it. But when they saw that Daniel was a friend of Jay, they immediately changed it.\nIn the newer chapters, he joined Daniel's original body crew,\nAllied\n, and was shown interacting with Daniel's first body, as well as helping him with some personal business outside the framework of the crew.\nLogan Lee\nTBA\nZack Lee\nTBA\nOther\nDaniel's mother\nJay has a good relationship with her. When he learnt that Daniel's mother made her living by selling garbage boxes, he went out of his way to order the manager of a hotel or a branch to deliver a heap of garbage boxes to their house so that Daniel's mother could sell them all."

        "background": "Jay comes from a very rich family, as shown by his expensive clothing.\nHe is tremendously wealthy, considering he gives a lot of his high-quality clothing and accessories to Daniel, as well as the size of his giant penthouse apartment. He is also very well respected by his butler and others. Jay is the second son of the H Group Conglomerate and the younger brother of\nKitae Hong\n, who is the heir to the family's company. Jay seems to have a high position in the company.\nJay is shown to care deeply for Daniel, not hesitating to spend lots of money on him to support, and helps to protect him whenever he's in danger. It is strongly implied that he has feelings for Daniel, though this is not confirmed.\nHe is implied to have a strained relationship with his parents. His father criticizes Jay for getting into a fist fight and tells him to \"don't ever call me again\". He seems to have a good relationship with his sister, Joy. There haven't been many scenes with Jay and Kitae to determine the quality of their relationship. In the one scene both are in together, Kitae disapproves of Jay going to a \"crappy\" Jae Won High School and \"dragging\" Joy there.\nExposition\nChapter 4\nHe was first introduced in chapter 4, seemingly intrigued by Daniel's transfer.\nChapter 6\nJay listens in when two girls and Zoe were flirting with Daniel.\nWhen\nZack\n's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jay, Zack's friends,\nMira Kim\n, and Zoe look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.\nAs Zack and Daniel were about to fight, Jay showed concern towards Daniel up to the point of attempting to prevent Zack's punch from hitting Daniel. However, as the fight continued, Jay showed slight amazement at Daniels skills. Later, he is in the bathroom listening as three of Zack's underlings were discussing on how to ambush Daniel. He is then seen leaving the bathroom with slightly bloodied clothing leaving the three underlings injured behind him.\nJay Arc\nDaniel greeted Jay gratefully recalling his efforts on stopping the fight, but midway received a call from\nhis mother\nabout his upcoming birthday. As this was happening, three of his classmates were talking about the possibility of Daniel being a beggar. On Daniel's birthday, Jay gave him a lot of expensive branded clothes. The next day, the same three classmates discussing about Daniel being a poor beggar were threatening to out him to the girls. However, when he arrived in the expensive clothing and as his classmates were complimenting him, Jay was seen with a smile on his face. At the end of the arc, it was revealed that Jay had tried to write a note to Daniel, wishing him a happy birthday and asking to be friends but had eventually just settled for a small tag with 'Happy Bday' written on it, which he gave Daniel along with the bags of clothing.\nFestival Arc\n(Chapter 25)\nDuring the slave auction, Jay was at the stand attempting to pay $10,000 in order to help Daniel out and save him from a date with Lala Kim. However, he was denied since men were not allowed to buy in the auction.\nPaprika TV Arc\n(Chapter 29)\nJay was shown at the end with a small grin on his face after he won against Lala Kim for donations to Daniel and Duk Hwa when they appeared in a paprika liveshow.\nSecond Hand Rana Arc\nWhen Nam Soo tells Zack that a group of con artists had stolen the money Zack had given him, Zack decides to pretend to be a buyer in order to confront the con artists. When Daniel goes to help Zack as well, Jay is seen listening in on them.\nWhen Zack, Daniel, and\nEuntae\nwere fighting the con artists, the con artists, fighting a losing battle, were waiting for backup from a group of freshmen.\nJay had passed by the freshman on his motorcycle and had incapacitated them in an alleyway. When two guys who used to be bothered by said freshmen showed up, they complimented Jay and told him not to smoke because, if he didn't, he would be able to get a lover. They told him that after they had quit smoking, both of them met someone. Jay immediately drops his cigarette (once again implying an attraction to Daniel).\nAutumn Boot Camp\nWhen getting on the bus, Daniel believes he would have to sit in the front next to the teacher. However, classmates wave at him, telling him to sit with them in the back. Jay is shown to take the seat next to the teacher instead.\nPavlov's Dog\nWhen\nLogan Lee\nsteals original Daniel's money, including the 5000 won bill Daniel's mother had given new Daniel, new Daniel explains to Jay that old Daniel was a special friend of his, so he had to get the money back. New Daniel introduces Jay to his mother as the friend of the fat Daniel. When Jay meets old Daniel for the first time, Jay acts kindly towards him and gives him a stick of gum (Jay had started chewing gum to stop smoking).\nOld Daniel tells Jay that New Daniel had gotten the 5000 won bill from Daniel's mother, which she had earned by selling boxes. He also told him that new Daniel thought of the note as a lucky charm. Jay, remembering the generosity of Daniel's mother and the way new Daniel valued old Daniel, becomes determined to get the money back.\nJay then goes to see a manager of a branch (of either a hotel or a company). The manager is respectful towards Jay and says he hopes Jay will remember him kindly. Jay had asked the manager to look into Logan, and the manager explains that Logan is a notorious bully who is the same age as Jay. He also tells Jay that Logan is a Jujitsu black belt.\nThe next day, Daniel's mother receives heaps of cardboard boxes from a nearby hotel, and Jay goes to confront Logan about the money. Logan, laughing asks why everyone was asking him about money that day and if Jay was trying to mug him. He asks who sent Jay to collect the money, and Jay only took off his jacket in response.\nLater, Jay is seen dealing consecutive kicks and punches to Logan. Logan realizes that Jujitsu doesn't seem to work on the style of fighting Jay is using, Systema, because Jay is fighting from further away. In order to force Jay closer, Logan takes out the envelope of money he had stolen from Daniel and threatens to rip it. Jay runs to save the envelope, only to be grabbed by the hair. Logan then begins to choke Jay using Popsicle.\nAs Jay runs out of oxygen and starts to go limp, Daniel in his new body runs to help Jay. When Logan tries to grab at Daniel, Daniel swipes the arm aside, running to Jay's side. Logan then realizes Daniel's strength as Jay had barely been able to dodge Logan's attacks earlier. Daniel had been resolved to fight Logan, but in front of Logan, this resolution wavered because of his fear. He began to make excuses such as fighting would dirty the clothes Jay had given him, and that he had to take care of the unconscious Jay. When Logan, frightened by Daniel, tells Daniel to leave, Daniel is relieved he doesn't have to fight, telling himself that maybe Logan's already spent the 5000 won.\nWhen Jay gains consciousness again, he is alarmed and flustered to find himself being carried on Daniel's back. When Daniel tries to comfort him, telling him to calm down and that it's fine if they didn't get the money back because Logan's a famous gangster, Jay hands Daniel the envelope of money he had brought to give to his mother as well as the 5000 won bill.\nDaniel feels ashamed that Jay had gotten the money back instead of him and starts crying. Jay, thinking that Daniel had started to cry because Jay was heavy and Daniel wasn't able to carry him anymore, gets off his back and offers Daniel a piggyback ride.\nLater, when Daniel in his original body goes to exchange the dress that he had bought for his mother for a different size, the sales clerk tells them they can't exchange it because the dress had a stain. Daniel explains that the stain had been there when he bought it and that another lady was able to exchange her dress for another size even though her dress had a stain too. The sales clerk says that the other lady doesn't seem like a liar whereas Daniel and his mother, who both look poor, are probably trying to cheat them. Daniel's mother says that it's fine and that the dress was too good to wear anyways. The sales clerks laugh and say that it's for the best, and that they had probably been the ones to stain the dress.\nSuddenly, Jay walks in and the manager asks the sales clerks the reason they're making a fuss. The manager apologizes to Jay and tells him it's not a big deal. Daniel then starts talking to Jay, who's worried about new Daniel's back. Daniel then asks why he's there, to which Jay may have responded that he was employed there. Daniel then assumes that Jay had worked there part-time when it is probably more likely that he owns the store. The other employees look shocked that Jay seems to know Daniel and immediately exchanged the dress for Daniel. Jay smiled as he walked away when Daniel thanked him. The manager and the sales clerks then apologize profusely to Daniel, offering them VIP status and hoping they would put in a good word for them with Jay.\nLee Euntae Arc\nWhen Euntae offers new Daniel a box of chocolate milk, Jay silently observes, and, a while later, offers Daniel two boxes of chocolate milk.\nJay's Wallet\nJay rushes over to Daniel to help him with a question at school, accidentally dropping his wallet in the process. Jiho pockets it, trying to prank Jay.\nLater, Daniel tags along when Jiho asks Jay to buy him some snacks in the hopes that Jay will notice the absence of his wallet. However, Jiho is disappointed to see Jay pay with his cell phone instead.\nWhile in the bathroom, Jiho discovers a check for 10 million won in Jay's wallet and is immediately overcome with guilt for taking it. He resolves to return the wallet to Jay quickly and stealthily, but fails each time as he is ultimately too afraid of embarrassing himself by being noticed.\nHowever, Jiho's backpack (with the wallet inside) is later stolen by a group of bullies, causing him to enter a state of panic. He runs to the convenience store where Daniel's original body is currently working and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow.\nDaniel then returns to the bullies after changing into his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him.\nAfter that, New Daniel takes Jiho to Jay's home. Joy, Jay's younger sister, opens the door for them. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she comes over on occasion. Joy tells them that Jay has just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. She mentions to Jay that Daniel is at the apartment, and his response is lightning-quick and very alarmed. Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and comments that it's not like her brother to do so. She discloses to Daniel and Jiho that Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him in his tracks, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl.\nIn order to subtly return the wallet, Jiho tries to throw the wallet inside of Jay's room but is hindered by Inu and her puppies, who are protective.\nJay comes home, sweaty from having run the entire way and holding a large bag. Upon seeing Daniel, he throws himself into a frenzy trying to clean every surface of the already pristine apartment. Jiho walks out of Jay's room after having successfully thrown the wallet inside (at the cost of being attacked by Inu and her pups) to see Jay, and notices that the bag he's carrying is full of stacks of 10 million won checks identical to the one inside the wallet.\nDaniel says that he has a lot of those checks, too. It turns out that rather than being actual checks, those slips of paper are just promotional flyers for the online shop for which Daniel models. Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho, realizing that all his effort was for nothing, promptly faints.\nThe arc ends with a cut to the previous day. Jay is offered a promotional flyer for the store for which Daniel works. People were throwing them away when they realized the papers weren't checks. Jay, however, turns his over to see Daniel's face printed on the back and smiles to himself as he slips it into his wallet.\nThe Stalker\nWhen Daniel tells his classmates that he had a stalker, the news appears to worry Jay. He then presses a box cutter into Daniel's hands. Daniel looks surprised and wonders if he had lent it to him before. Jay also walks off with an obvious blush after giving Daniel the box cutter.\nLater, when the stalker kidnaps Daniel and Crystal, Crystal is able to cut herself free from the restraints tying her up when Daniel slips the box cutter that Jay gave him into her hands.\nTroubled Transfer\nHe sees Daniel shivering and gives him a concerned look. He glances at Logan Lee, which is the cause of Daniel's shivering.\nPicnic\nJay is with Daniel, Zoe, Mira, Zack, and Joy at the school picnic. Zack tells Daniel that he's dead if they can't get a ride since he's late, and Jay sweatdrops. The group decides to ride Altan first, which Mira says is scary. Everyone ends up wearing something on their heads, and Jay and Daniel both wear cat ears and they are happy, while Zack wears Minnie Mouse ears, which he is embarrassed for.\nOn a ride called Disco Pow Pow that spins very quickly, Joy decides to throw herself at Daniel. Daniel and Jay are sitting next to each other, and Jay stares in horror. He ends up catching her by the face before Daniel can save her. Joy smiles and thanks her brother, but she is secretly frustrated inside. She tries again several times, but Jay caught her every time.\n[\n1\n]\nThey play the Strength Test, and Jay is not impressed when Zack scores an 85. The group splits up after Daniel leaves with Crystal as an excuse to brush off Soomi. Joy smacks Jay and says that they'd go to Magic Island together.\n[\n2\n]\nPeople around the two gossip and ask if the two were a rich couple. Joy wants to go somewhere that Jay doesn't so they agree that Jay will wait for Joy. Jay sits down somewhere and looks at the back of his phone. There's a sticker of Daniel wrapping one arm around Jay's shoulder on it. Jay smiles at it.\nHe sees the Drop Tower from the corner of his eye and imagines Daniel congratulating him on being brave for riding it. When he gets on the ride, he sees someone taking a selfie and chooses to also take a picture. However, it is unexpected when the ride starts, and Jay drops his phone and his wallet.\nAfter the ride, he frantically looks for his lost items. Seonong mistakes him for a beggar and makes fun of him.\n[\n3\n]\nSeonong finds a pair of shoes and steals them, and they happen to be Jay's. He doesn't realize the shoes are Jay's and throws his old pair of shoes at him. Soomi and her friends see him, and he is wearing the old pair of shoes. Soomi thinks the shoes look vintage unlike the guys at school, which is ironic. He offers he a tissue for her bloody nose that she got while getting beat up by Crystal. She blushes wonders if he's flirting with her (he isn't).\n[\n4\n]\nWith the help of people, he finally finds his phone and wallet, but they are damaged. Despite that, Jay is still incredibly happy and hugs his possessions.\nSoomi is flirting with the churro stand guy, but she can't stop thinking of Jay. She wills herself to stop thinking of him however, because she thinks he is poor. A chairman passes by, and they acknowledge Jay as his brother, and Soomi finds in shock that he was actually rich.\nThe chairman playfully tells Jay that he should have been lying quietly, yet he dragged his sister to the school. Joy protests by saying she actually liked the school.\nThe chairman, otherwise known as Kitae introduces Crystal and Jay. They bow respectfully to each other. Soomi and the churro stand guy glare at them jealously.\n[\n5\n]\nThe group reunites to eat. Daniel tells Jay that he couldn't contact him, and Jay nods when Daniel asks if he broke it on the Gyro Drop. They take a third group picture at the Ferris wheel, and Jay's face is facing the camera from the side. From afar, Soomi studies Jay curiously.\n[\n6\n]\nSeonong Goes to School\nWhen Seonong goes to Seoul to return the money that Vasco gave him, he gets chased by the Burn Knuckles in a misunderstanding. The Burn Knuckles mistakenly think that he's kidnapped a child and go after him. Jay hears about it and he chases after Seonong with them.\n[\n7\n]\nCrystal's Investigation\nJay sees Daniel and Crystal at the department store buying clothing. People around them mistake Daniel and Crystal for a couple and Jay looks away.\n[\n8\n]\nWhen Jay is swimming laps, he thinks back to Daniel and Crystal in the store and starts to swim faster. In class the next day, Daniel says that he felt bad for always taking Jay's things, so he bought some new clothing for Jay. Daniel says that he thought of Jay at the department store and Jay blushes.\nAt home, Jay tries on the clothing. His butler sweatdrops at the mismatched clothing, but Jay is happy to walk his dogs in what Daniel gave him.\n[\n9\n]\nFake Bank Account\nKouji says that he was willing to help Jiho and his friends recover the bank account because they were the monkeys that Jay kept as pets.\n[\n10\n]\nDaniel Park's Death\nDaniel thinks of the moments he had spent with his friends when he sees his second body getting driven away by the ambulance. The moments he remembers of Jay are studying together before the finals in freshman year, talking to Jay in a one-sided conversation, and carrying Jay on his back.\n[\n11\n]\nHomeless\nDaniel finally wakes up in his second body and checks his phone. On Instagram, there's a picture of Jay with the dogs. On Vasco's Instagram, Jay, Mira, Zack, and Zoe are sitting around a cake. The board in the background has \"We miss you, Daniel~ T_T come back to us\" written on it.\n[\n12\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 139\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 140\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 141\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 144\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 147\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 148\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 159\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 161\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 162\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 167\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 172\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 194"

He also has lots of experience in fighting given his battle against numerous crews. Jerry doesn't seem to back off in a fight regardless of how injured he becomes and also doesn't dodge an attack when he can; this is seen as a weakness by Gun. Jerry is also shown to hold back his full strength whenever he is in a fight near Jake.\nAfter his fight with Gun, he decided to never lose another fight again and learned Boxing as a martial art to help.\nAlso in the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Jerry was shown to have an 'enraged' mode where he stopped holding back entirely and pushed Mandeok Bang extremely far and to push Mandeok to use moves against Jerry that he didn't use against Tom Lee\nQuotes\nI\u2019m your sword, Jake.

He used to wear a dark brown tie with white circle patterns with a white polo shirt under a beige business suit with black shoes, as well a flame-shaped scar in his right eye.\nIn his final moments, he wears a Chungcheong police uniform.",
        "personality": "Jichang was a astute and extrememely intelligent individual who notices what people are feeling even before he talks with him.After hearing that\nDaniel Park\nwas looking\nat Jinyoung Park\n, he analyzed the situation and concluded that he could potentially be on\nCharles Choi's\nside coming to clean evidence. He quickly came up with a plan to quietly use his former crew to get rid of him and get rid of the body all without lifting a finger thus protecting his image as a cop. It's also good to note that he does not share the same fighting bloodthirst most other Kings have, he would much rather stand back and only fight when necessary.\nWhen it eventually came to light that\nDaniel Park\nwas only looking for Jinyoung Park before Charles Choi and actively opposed him, Jichang's demeanor changed, becoming a respectable and understanding man who showed devotion to the case against Charles Choi. He holds utmost respect for\nBakgu Noh\n, and while he doesn't show it, he cares deeply about his brothers. While he is strict, it's done to eventually shape them into becoming better kings than he was.",
        "synopsis": "Jichang Kwak was the King of Seoul during the 1st Generation, and was likely to have been financially successful, as he presumably owned high-rise property and was willing to compensate\nJaegyeon Na\nfor his damaged car. Prior to cheonliang arc as per gapryong Kim's disciple jinrang and jichang have met where jichang told him to stop being a dog and become a alpha greatly helping jinrang. Seonji yuk was present\nDuring the\nCheonliang Arc\n, Jichang , along with the other Kings, appeared in Cheonliang after receiving a \"signal\" from\nSeongji Yuk\n[\n1\n]\n. Upon realising that Seongji had been maimed by\nShinmyung Cheon\n, Jichang became incensed and decided to fight the\nGhostly\nBrothers\n. Although it appeared that he was struggling against them at first, he revealed that he was actually observing them due to their notoriety, but found that they had failed to meet his expectations. Deeming that there was \"no need to even come up with a strategy\", Jichang easily defeated the Ghostly Brothers\n[\n2\n]\n.\nJichang and the other Kings then shifted their attention to James Lee, blaming him for his role in defeating Seongji which led to his brutal fate. As the exhausted and injured James fled, Jichang demonstrated his cerebral prowess by steering him towards Jaegyeon. However, James still managed to escape. Before his departure, Jichang asked James what he and his ally, Charles Choi, were planning, to which James only gave an ominous reply, telling the Kings that he would visit them again soon\n[\n3\n]\n.\nLater on, Jichang was ousted from the city by Gitae Kim and exiled to Chungcheong-do, where he began to work as a police officer in an official capacity. With his brothers and Bakgu Noh, Jichang quietly lived for years in the countryside. Jichang was \"indebted\" to Bakgu Noh, and aligned himself with\nJinyeong Park\n, committing himself to helping Bakgu in his pursuit for justice\n[\n4\n]\n.\nAt some point, Jichang was visited and defeated in battle by James Lee, who expressed disappointment in the state of the former King of Seoul. Feeling sorry for him, James spared Jichang from having a body part taken away, as was the fate of the other defeated Kings\n[\n5\n]\n.\nWhen Daniel Park came to Chungcheong during the\nHolidays 2 Arc\n, Jichang was alerted when Daniel came to the police station and asked for information about Jinyeong Park. Believing Daniel to be working for Charles Choi, Jichang immediately ordered for Daniel to be dealt with quietly by his subordinates, including his brothers. However, Jichang was eventually confronted by Daniel, who saw through his plan and realised that the unassuming police officer was the King of Chungcheong\n[\n6\n]\n.\nInitially underestimating Daniel, Jichang said that he wouldn't \"even raise a hand against\" Daniel. He was soon proven wrong when Daniel landed multiple hits on him, and the two began to fight. Having the upper hand at first, Jichang was overpowered temporarily by Daniel who had entered his \"self-loathing mode\". As Daniel had brought up James Lee's name, Jichang decided to use his signature hand blades against Daniel, overwhelming Daniel and nearly defeating him, if not for the interference of\nhis\nallies\n[\n5\n]\n.\nWith Daniel copying James Lee's abilities to attack him, Jichang chose to demonstrate his superior strength and speed, and dealt serious blows onto Daniel to the point where he was pushed into his\nUltra Instinct\nstate. Knowing that there was no longer room for leeway, Jichang went for an extremely strong strike on the charging Daniel. However, before either of their hits could connect, Bakgu Noh stepped in to end the fight, having recognised Daniel as a relative of Jinyeong Park\n[\n7\n]\n.\nAfter the skirmish, Jichang apologises to Daniel about having sent his men to attack Daniel and his friends. Jichang reveals that he has been laying low in Chungcheong for years to help out Bakgu, whom he refers to respectfully as \"Mr Noh\". Before Daniel's departure for Jinyeong's location, Daniel asks for his help in Seoul, recognising Jichang's strength. Both Bakgu and Jichang are impressed by this gesture, although Jichang rejects the offer and promises that once he has settled his matters in Chungcheong, he will lend Daniel his strength.\nSoon after Daniel leaves, Jichang discusses with Bakgu their plans to take down Charles Choi, having sent Daniel away to avoid involving him in the conflict. Jichang and Bakgu sends evidence of Charles' involvement in the infamous\nGapryong Kim\nmurder case to a media outlet later that day, hoping that this would finally bring justice.\nThat night, however, Charles appears in Chungcheong, revealing that the media outlet in question was actually controlled by him. Having located Bakgu, one of the final obstacles in his way, Charles intends to kill Bakgu, but this attempt on his life is stopped by Jichang's appearance. Aware that both of them would be unable to defeat the legendary fighter, Jichang sends Bakgu away to spread the evidence of Charles' guilt himself, while keeping Charles' attention on him\n[\n4\n]\n.\nRejecting offers to become his bodyguard, Jichang and Charles engage in a full-on fight, with Charles recognising the danger that he is in, not only due to Jichang's exceptional strength and speed, but his battle strategies. With Jichang seemingly defeated, Charles approaches Jichang to kill him. Unexpectedly, Jichang draws his revolver on Charles.\nUnfortunately, Charles is able to disarm him and gains control of the gun, landing a fatal shot on Jichang's abdomen. When Bakgu returns back to the cabin, Jichang attempts to warn Bakgu of Charles' hidden presence to no avail, leading to Charles shooting and killing Bakgu as well.\nAfter the incident, Charles Choi manipulated the scene and media to hide the truth, framing Bakgu for attempting to steal Jichang's gun and both being killed in the scuffle. Although his brothers were unwilling to believe the story portrayed by the media, the truth of the matter was only revealed to them by Daniel, who had correctly deduced that Charles Choi was behind the double murder.\nJichang's funeral was held in Chungcheong and had a large amount of mourners, many of whom were members of the First Generation, including the Kings. Finding that the circumstances of the case to be suspicious, some of the Kings have begun investigating the issue, while Jichang's brothers, Jibeom and Jihan Kwak have joined forces with Daniel Park to seek revenge on Charles Choi\n[\n8\n]\n.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Like the other 1st Generation Kings, Jichang Kwak specially trained a signature move, that being his hand chops which he calls \"The Hand Blade\". A single Hand Blade has the power to break a safe, the blow itself having a similar Attack Potency to\nTaesoo Ma\n, making him one of the strongest members of the\n1st Generation\nin terms of Attack Power and Speed.\nIn terms of intelligence, Jichang was presented as possessing such an aptitude for strategy that he was able to successfully get a hit against Charles Choi. And was even acknowledged by Gitae Kim during their duel.\nIn the\npast\n, Jichang was praised by James Lee to be a extremely intelligent fighter.",
        "relationships": "Charles Choi\nJichang desired the fall of Charles and actively assisted the Pre-Generation Bakgu Noh in carrying out a plan to get revenge on Charles. When Charles discovered their location, Jichang held him off, eventually being able to manipulate the situation so that he would be able to get a shot off on Charles with his gun, a strategy that ultimately failed.\nBakgu Noh\nAfter Jichang's retirement, he became committed to helping Bakgu get his revenge on Charles Choi, even going so far as to attempt to hold Charles off so Bakgu could secure the evidence that served as Charles' weak point. In the end, this attempt failed as Bakgu was lured back to the scene and killed by Charles Choi, Jichang himself dying soon after.\nAfter the pair's deaths, Charles framed Bakgu for being responsible for the incident, the official story being that Bakgu attacked Jichang, who struggled to take the gun from Bakgu, before the gun went off, ending in both being killed.\nTrivia\nAccording to\nCharles Choi\n, one of the things that sets Jichang apart from the other Kings is his superior strength and speed, the second being that he is a tactician.\nJichang used to be the King of Seoul, but he was usurped and exiled to Chungcheong-do by Jake Kim's half-brother. Regarding this fact, James Lee mentions that Jichang was crushed by that man.\nWhen Jichang was exiled to Chungcheong-do, he defeated and drove out the original King of Chungcheong. The existence of this King is only known from a brief mention by\nJames Lee\nin chapter 438 when he says \"The original King of Chungcheong did nothing wrong.\"\nGallery\nHolidays 2\nEp. 434\n- Daniel & Jichang helping a man out\nEp. 434\n- Jichang Kwak's introduction\nEp. 435\n- Jichang standing on top of building\nEp. 435\n- Jichang looking down from the roof\nEp. 436\n- Jichang in his younger days\nEp. 436\n- Jichang looking back\nEp. 436\n- Jichang looking back (Close Up)\nEp. 437\n- Jichang in the past\nEp. 437\n- Jichang holding Jihan by his shirt\nEp. 437\n- Jichang walking by Jihan\nEp. 437\n- Jichang walking by Jihan\nEp. 438\n- Daniel breaks Jichang's glasses\nEp. 438\n- Jichang shocked\nEp. 438\n- Daniel stepping on Jichang\nEp. 438\n- Jichang looking defeated\nEp. 438\n- Jichang thanking Daniel for reminding him of a terrible memory\nEp. 438\n- Jichang being serious\nEp. 438\n- Jay & Hudson protecting Daniel\nEp. 438\n- Jichang getting hit\nEp. 438\n- Jichang being pissed\nEp. 439\n- Jichang admits Daniel has talent\nEp. 439\n- Daniel copying James Lee vs Jichang\nEp. 439\n- Daniel vs Jichang\nEp. 439\n- Jichang catches Daniel\nEp. 439\n- Jichang starts smoking during the fight\nEp. 439\n- Jichang throws his smoke into the air\nEp. 439\n- Jichang catches up to Daniel\nEp. 439\n- Jichang standing on Daniel\nEp. 439\n- Jichang walking towards Jay & Hudson\nEp. 439\n- Jichang looking back\nEp. 439\n- Jichang, Jay & Hudson watch Daniel get up\nEp. 439\n- Jichang being hurt by Daniel\nEp. 439\n- Jichang smiling during the fight\nEp. 439\n- Jichang ready to strike Daniel\nEp. 439\n- Jichang surprised\nEp. 439\n- Bakgu Noh stops Daniel and Jichang Kwak\nEp. 439\n- Jichang showing respect\nEp. 439\n- Jichang looking closely at Daniel's face\nEp. 439\n- Jichang realises who Daniel is\nEp. 440\n- Jichang talking about Charles\nEp. 440\n- Bakgu explains they're on a run from Charles\nEp. 440\n- Jichang asking if Daniel has anything else to say\nEp. 440\n- Daniel asking Jichang if he could join Allied\nEp. 440\n- Jichang saying Daniel is a real piece of work\nEp. 440\n- Jichang decling Daniel's invitation\nEp. 440\n- Jichang defending Bokgu\nEp. 441\n- Jichang smoking before the fight\nEp. 441\n- Jichang getting hit in the foot\nEp. 441\n- Jichang holding Charles at gun point\nEp. 441\n- Jichang shot\nEp. 441\n- Jichang being helf by Bakgu\nEp. 441\n- Charles fabricating scenario\nEp. 441\n- Bakgu & Jichang's death on news\nEp. 441\n- Daniel remembering their smiles\nEp. 441\n- Jichang telling Daniel to find Jinyeong\nFuneral\nEp. 442\n- Jibeom talking about the news\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 460\n- Daniel using Jichang's technique\nEp. 460\n- Daniel using Jichang's technique 2\nEp. 461\n- Daniel coping Jichang's technique\nEp. 467\n- Daniel copy\nEp. 468\n- Daniel's other body copies Jichang\nEp. 471\n- Jihan's flashback\nEp. 476\n- Daniel's flashback\nCheonliang (Arc)\n1\n2\nBusan\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 493 (Cheonliang Arc)\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 494 (Cheonliang Arc)\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 495 (Cheonliang Arc)\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\nWebtoon, Episode 440 (Holidays 2 Arc)\n\u2191\n5.0\n5.1\nWebtoon, Episode 438 (Holidays 2 Arc)\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 436 (Holidays 2 Arc)\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 439 (Holidays 2 Arc)\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Episode 441 (Holidays 2 Arc)\nNavigation"

He was easily and effortlessly overpowering a post Alexander Sophia training Jay Hong during their fight, but it should also been known that Jay Hong was trying to put a helmet on Jihan's head for his Kali Arnis and only using Systema. While his Hand-Blade style is exceptionally powerful as it almost knocked out Jay Hong, he isn't an idiot and knows that the Hand-Blades can only get him so far, so his true fighting style is a more street like fighting style that involves kicks, punches, knees and elbows. Surprisingly with his scarred up build he has great durability and endurance as he could take every Systema attack used against him by Jay and even overpowered the Systema using Jay Hong and was about to kill him before Jay distracted him and used Kali Arnis. While Jihan did survive the onslaught of attacks used by Jay Hong and could have kept on fighting he accepted his defeat (indicating that he is honorable) and wished his enemy (at that time) luck on the fight ahead.He is still definitely above Jay without weapons as he is shown to overpower Jay in hand to hand combat and is smart enough to take on Hudson and Vin Jin without much difficulty if he uses his battle IQ which ranks him higher.

Worried about him, Jake sends two of his men after Jiho.\nJake talks to Brad and Jason about Jiho.

This was especially noticeable whenever he went out with bad crowds, as he was always trying and failing to be \u201ccool\u201d to the point of committing crimes (such as illegal betting, underage drinking, and even almost vandalism). When he was sitting with\nDuke\nand\nDaniel\noutside of the convenience store, he started smoking to try to look cooler than them, saying that he had smoked many times; despite it actually being his first. He also bought a lot of expensive brands and limited items for the same reason.\nHe was power-hungry and obsessed with status, proceeding to take many dangerous actions simply to climb up the social hierarchy. He was friends with Daniel and\nZack\njust to enhance his perceived image, and never actually reciprocated any of their friendships and gestures. He only went to them whenever he wanted help. He also looked down on people who he considered lower than him and sometimes even provoked them, but would then run to Daniel and his friends for protection.\nJiho had a habit of victimizing himself and has an inferiority complex. He felt distanced from Daniel's group but never tried to genuinely befriend them in the first place. He was also a very desperate person, going to various lengths to get away with his mistakes and hide his wrongdoings. He lied to the detective that he had actually pushed\nJames Gong\nand Daniel Park.\nAt Juvenile Prison, he got influenced by\nanother prisoner\nand was in solitary for so long that he became a sociopath. He developed a lust for murder and tried to kill a\ncellmate\nand his main bully at Juvenile Prison. He ended up getting into fights and making more problems, so much so that the authorities continually shifted him from cells.\n[\n5\n]",
        "fighting_prowess": "Jiho Park in J High was almost always one of the weakest kids in class. His scrawny frame and lack of skill meant he was always on the receiving end of a beatdown. However, after getting into prison and creating his new philosophy Jiho developed a \"fighting style\" similar to\nEli Jang\nand\nDominic Min\n. He became far more determined and vicious, getting back up after taking hits from Darius Hong and\nBrad Lee\nin prison and never faltering for even a second. He also used anything he could grab as a weapon, while also using unfair tactics like biting and sneaking up on them to win. After a couple of months, Jiho became so feared in the prison that he had formed a \"crew\" of his own and used his underlings to act for him out of fear.\nQuotes\nIf you didn't have your body... you would definitely become like me.\n[\n6\n]\nIf you're handsome, you're treated differently\n.\n[\n6\n]\nTrivia\nIn\nepisode 8\n, we saw Jiho's phone when\nDoo\ncalled him it's revealed there that he gave him the name Master2\n[\n7\n]\nHis number in prison was 6618.\n[\n8\n]\nJiho was implied to have been raped in prison by Darius, after Jiho attempted to intimidate him by saying he was in prison for attempted murder.\nIt's mentioned that Jiho had a form of Schizophrenia according to his medical record in Ep 371.\nHe didn't wear underwear.\n[\n9\n]\nIn prison, Jake Kim would bet on Jiho winning whatever fight he would get himself into.\n[\n10\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 4\n\u2191\nEpisode 263\n\u2191\nJiho Park\n\u2191\nEp. 369\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 185\n\u2191\n6.0\n6.1\nEpisode 369\n\u2191\nEpisode 8\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 184\n\u2191\nWebtoon, Chapter 110\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 185"

When Jiho met him the second time, he apologized for the fight and he had bought Duke with him as he didn't want to apologize alone.\nThe trio talked with each other for a long time and shared their experiences of being bullied. They became good friends and Jiho used to visit him in the store often along with Duk Hwa.\nBut soon he started visiting Daniel's old body only when he wanted help from him. He also stole some money from the store for illegal betting. Even though he had helped Jiho, in the end, Jiho considered Daniel's old body as having lower status than himself.\nNew Body\nDaniel invited him to eat with him during lunch at school, and they soon became good friends. Through Daniel, Jiho met Zack, Mira, Jay, Joy, and Daniel's other friends. He reciprocated their friendships at first, but it did not continue as he only cared about his own status and took advantage of Daniel's popularity for himself. Daniel tried to invite Jiho to hang out with them constantly, but Jiho still felt left out of the group.\nWhen Daniel restrained James Goh from attacking Jiho, Jiho was enraged as Daniel told him to run away. He twisted Daniel's words. This resulted in him pushing Daniel and James out of the window, thereby committing a crime - attempted murder. Even after putting them into a coma, he wished that they never wake up so that he could get away with the crime.\nDoo Lee\nTBA\nDuke Pyeon\nJiho is on friendy terms with Duke Pyeon\nHan Park\nTBA\nKay Jang\nTBA\nZack Lee\nZack used to bully Jiho, before he met Daniel.

But after James cyber attacked him by looting his money, Zack was concerned about Jiho and fought for him.\nBig Deal\nJake Kim\nJiho befriended Jake during his gambling days. Jake eventually cheated Jiho out of his money, but Jiho got it back. They meet again in juvenile prison, where Jake decides to mentor Jiho. He teaches Jiho to be ruthless towards his enemies and takes his own advice for when he decides to\u00a0fight Gun.\nOther\nJames Gong\nWhen Jiho first meets James, he is overjoyed at the attention James and his friends give him. He gives James money, and eventually even gives him a credit card. When James betrays him by selling the bank account the credit card is linked to, Jiho unfriends him.\nHe tries to get revenge on James by harming him with a box cutter, but is beaten up, only to be saved by Daniel. In the end, he pushes both James and Daniel out a window, getting him charged for attempted murder."

He also befriends Jake Kim, the boss of Big Deal (but he is unaware of this). Jiho becomes obsessed with gambling and loses all his money. He begs John's friend Jake to lend him some, and Jake's gangster accomplice tells him to take out a loan.\nWhen Jiho gets enough money to pay back the gamblers they cut all contact to him. Jiho becomes desperate and asks Daniel to forgive him for his crimes. Crystal calls Kouji, and they help Jiho get his money back.\nJae Yeol's Wallet\nJiho had just gotten his mom to buy him a new Vibe limited edition backpack, and his friends were fawning over it. However, when Jiho was with Jay and Daniel, the girls didn't notice him but, instead, at Jay and Daniel. Feeling jealous, Jiho decides to steal Jay's wallet and pull a prank on it. He discovers Jay has a lot of money in his wallet and tries to return it, and is met with difficulty. He eventually makes it to Jay's house and returns the wallet.\nFake Bank Account\nJiho is lonely because Daniel's friends leave him out. He befriends James Gong, a former classmate who used to be a problem kid. James is nice to Jiho but a little bit crazy. Regardless, he likes having a friend.\nJames asks Jiho to give him some money a lot, so he makes him a bank account. James sells this bank account to Jin Jang, who uses it to scam people and make money for the God Dogs. Jiho can't get his account back so he tries to find the scammers. Zack decides to help him, and with his friends they manage to find the bank accounts.\nAt school, Jiho is a laughingstock for getting into scams.

Jiho challenges Darius to a fight again and almost kills him by fighting dirty and fighting to the death. Jake becomes interested in Jiho\u00a0and he gives him the advice to fight to the death. He later changes his looks to looking more of a teenage murderer.\nJuvenile Prison Jiho Park\nJiho is assigned a psychologist to look at his case. He pretends to be a kindhearted boy so the psychologist will grant him release from the prison.

While nobody is watching he does horrific acts to the other inmates in his cell, bullying Riley and trying to push Jason Yoon into a saw, now that he is in charge of most of the prison after his brutal victory against Darius Hong. Jake accepts him into Big Deal and other inmates decide to listen to Jiho out of fear of his personality. Once he is in the clear to leave prison, he attacks the psychologist, for talking about Jiho's past, saying that you cannot just look into somebody's past like that before he slams a metal lunch tray at the side of the psychologist's head, knockin him out down to the ground.

        "fighting_prowess": "His fighting style hasn't been revealed yet, but it has been disclosed that he is among the three persons in the entire verse that possesses the Copying Ability (the other two being Daniel Park and Johan Seong).\nJinyeong Park after a fight, when he was in Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang.\nMoreover, although he is probably far from his heyday level of fighting, if we consider his position in Gapryong's Fist Gang, it's clear that he is a strong man with enough fighting power to have the upper hand on a character such as\nTom Lee\n, who is recognized in the verse and acknowledged by the author as one of the strongest fighters.\nJinyeong attacking Tom Lee\nThat aside, he is the only one among the executives of Gapryong's Fist Gang that has not suffered any physical damage (for reference,\nElite\nlost his arm, and\nTom Lee\nhis hand). Instead, he seems to suffer from a severe mental illness that would greatly decrease his combat capability, which could be seen as a worse handicap than Charles Choi's missing arm or Tom Lee's missing hand.\nJinyeong Park's Unknown Brother Theory\nIt was recently confirmed that Daniel's mother is the eldest of three siblings, for now we know that one of them is Jinyeong Park, while little or nothing is known about the other brother.\nIn chapter 403, Jinyeong Park says \"My brother!\" after shouting \"Elite!\", he then asks to be killed as well. This could mean that Jinyeong Park's brother died or something terrible happened to him because of Charles Choi, it could be the reason why Seonhui Park believes that he died too.\nWhatever happened to her with the unknown brother could be the reason why Jinyeong Park lost his sanity.\nQuotes\n\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Your uncle is so sorry...! Your uncle should've protected you... but I was so foolish and lacking...! Uncle should've been the one to protect everything.. your uncle should've protected everyone...! I'm so sorry that I let your dad die...\"\n\"You brat, did you forget what your uncle told you? That I would do anything, for you Jake. That's right. From now on, your uncle will be on your side.\"\nGallery\nJames Lee (Arc)\nEp. 359\n- Gen 0\nEp. 359\n- Gen 0 2\nWorkers (4th Affiliate)\nEp. 295\n- 10 geniuses\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)\nEp. 377\n- Neko talking about Gapryong Fist\nEp. 393\n- Eugene talking about Jinyoung\nEp. 393\n- Jinyoung smiling\nThe Kidnapping of Daniel Park\nEp. 394\n- Daniel trying to negotiate with Jinyoung\nEp. 394\n- Jinyoung annoyed by Daniel\nEp. 395\n- Daniel reveals his secret\nEp. 396\n- Jinyoung shocked\nEp. 396\n- Jinyoung complaining\nEp. 397\n- Gun talking about Copy Geniuses\nEp. 398\n- Jinyoung's flashback\nThe Hunt for Hostel\nEp. 402\n- Jinyoung vs Tom\nEp. 402\n- Jinyoung vs Tom 2\nEp. 402\n- Jinyoung vs Tom 1 & 2\nEp. 403\n- Tom knocks Jinyoung with a syringe\nThe Hunt for Big Deal\nEp. 411\n- Jake talking about Gapryong Fist 1\nEp. 411\n- Jake talking about Gapryong Fist 2\nEp. 418\n- Tom's flashback\nEp. 427\n- Daniel's flashback\nEp. 428\n- Daniel's flashback\nThe United Four Major Crews\nEp. 430\n- Jinyeong's photo\nEp. 431\n- Jinyeong experimenting on Samuel\nHolidays 2\nEp. 432\n- Daniel's mother holding Jinyeong's photo\nEp. 433\n- Daniel's father with Jinyoung Park\nEp. 433\n- Daniel's father with Jinyoung Park 2\nEp. 434\n- Daniel holding Jinyeong's photo\nEp. 439\n- Bakgu reveal\nEp. 440\n- Bakgu talking about revenge against Charles\nEp. 441\n- Jichang talking about Jinyeong & Elite\nFuneral\nEp. 442\n- Bongae telling Jake to find Jinyeong\nLookism (Arc)\nEp. 443\n- Jinyeong on the phone\nEp. 444\n- Jinyeong scares Samuel\nEp. 445\n- Jinyeong looking back\nEp. 446\n- Daniel holding unconscious Jinyeong\nThe First Affiliate's Dark Secret\nEp. 448\n- Jinyeong entering his lab\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 451\n- Jinyeong with Johan, Samuel & Daniel\nEp. 462\n- Jinyeong getting his plan ready\nEp. 463\n- Daniel's flashback\nEp. 464\n- Jinyeong experimenting on Johan\nEp. 466\n- Jinyeong putting Samuel into frenzy\nEp. 468\n- Jinyeong copies Gapryong\nEp. 469\n- Jinyeong copy Tom\nEp. 469\n- Jake Kim as a child hugging Jinyoung Park\nEp. 469\n- Jinyeong helping Jake\nEp. 470\n- Jinyeong using Gapryong's technique\nEp. 470\n- Big Daniel copying Gapryong\nEp. 470\n- Jinyeong's experience\nEp. 471\n- Daniel's flashback\nEp. 474\n- Gyeoul's flashback\nEp. 475\n- Tom talking about Jinyeong\nEp. 476\n- Daniel's flashback 2\nEp. 477\n- Sera stops Daniel\nEp. 478\n- Johan's flashback\nA Drink Between Brothers\nEp. 479\n- Jerry's flashback\nUnknown Chapter/Arc\nUnknown Chapter/Arc\nTrivia\nHe seems to know someone other than\nDaniel Park\nthat also has two bodies, seeing his reaction when he learned that Daniel indeed had two.

        "synopsis": "Episode 252\nJin Jang\nbegins spreading rumors in\nJ high\nabout who is the best fighter. He learns that\nDaniel\nis the strongest but that\nZack\nis determined to beat him. He believes\nLogan\nis stronger than\nVasco\nbut the\nBurn Knuckles\nprotest that nobody is stronger than him. He learns that\nJay\nand\nEli\nare not fans of fighting and fails to mention Vin or Mary, which triggers Vin.\nIn the bathroom Jin is preparing what to do with this information when he is approached by\nJace\n, who tells him he knows why Jin came. Jin reveals that he is not yet done with his analysis as he has yet to analyze Jay or Eli. He set up an ambush for both of them using the\nGod Dog\nOBs; Eli is stopped by the Park brothers and Jay is stopped by Scott Kwon and Dominic Min.\nEpisode 253\nJin Jang suspects that Eli will be in trouble because he hasn't fought in a while, and Jay was overprotected as a child. Jace thinks otherwise, believing that Jay and Eli are just hiding their strength. Eli has difficulty fighting the Park brothers because they are trained and he is a streetfighter, and Jay has the opposite problem. Jin reveals that he set up these matches so they would have no chance of winning.\nJace has faith that Eli will win his fight regardless of his weaknesses because Eli has determination and willpower. He will do anything for\nYenna\n, and when he realizes he is late to pick her up he goes into savage mode. Jace is also unconcerned for Jay, believing that Jay still has one trick up his sleeve: the contents of his suitcase that nobody knows. With these words Jay pulls out a gun and aims a laser at Dominic's forehead.\nEpisode 254\nScott and Dominic are frozen in fear, and Jay takes the opportunity to attack them. He defeats them with Kali Arnis, a martial art specific to improvised weaponry. Eli Jang also defeats Hope and Ivan Park using his blunt savagery, racing to the daycare to pick up Yenna. Jace tells Jin he could have never expected it, and Jin counters by saying Jace couldn't expect Jin escaping from a window.\nJace cringes at his escape and decides he overestimated Jin, but Jin tells Olly that Jace is too prideful. He came to J high not to analyze the fighters, but to analyze Jace's analytical skills. He tells Olly he has a three step plan to destroy J high, and his first step will target Jace.\nCookie\nAt her house\nJoy\nasks her father's assistant for a rifle, which he gives her. She asks why he has so many guns when he's not a kid and he asks if she believes they are real. He tells her even he isn't sure whether the guns are real.\nEnding\nDaniel and his friends decide to go on a trip to visit Jay's seaside villa. He packs his handsome body in a large suitcase and carries it onto the train. He is happy they won't have to fight but\nOlly\nsuspects there will be a fight, so he sends the uncles of Hostel to Cheongliang.\nMary Kim\nand\nVin Jin\nare back in their hometown Cheongliang when they hear the fashion department kids are headed there. Mary is worried because Vin's old friends are dangerous, and wonders if they will be alright.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

When he was younger, he was very obedient and cared dearly about his mother and Mira. He was also very faithful to his religion.\nDuring his middle school years, Johan had low self esteem and thought of himself as a loser, ostracizing himself from his only friends, Mira and Zack. He overcame his jealousy by beating Zack in the boxing championship, only to completely disappear from their lives soon after.\nAfter the incident with the cult, Johan turns more reserved and cold. He has a bitter view of the world and believes power is the most important thing. He cannot stand optimistic characters like\nVasco\nwho have a bright worldview, and he takes defeat to such characters personally. However, it is implied by Vasco that the reason he is so cold is because he is lonely and is afraid to trust in others.\n[\n3\n]\nJohan is stubborn, especially when it comes to other gang members. He can be commanding, as demonstrated when he did not hesitate to order around two members of Hostel after he defeated them\n[\n4\n]\n. He can also be incredibly childish when jealous of others,\n[\n3\n]\nas seen in the 'One Night' arc where he teamed up with\nJace Park\nand became evidently jealous of Jace and\nVasco\n's close friendship as described by Jace, going out of his way to prove his own worth. His selfishness is cited as a major character flaw by both\nGun\nand\nJin Jang\n,\n[\n5\n]\nthe former giving it as the reason why Johan was disqualified as his successor.\nAlthough Johan claims that his only family are his dogs, Eden and Miro, it's implied he still cares about his mother. This is seen when he continued to go back to her hair salon, despite her deteriorating vision meaning he never got a good haircut. Which also  caused her to continually think he was Zack instead. Also the fact that he formed a crew to pay for his mothers cornea transplant.",
        "fighting_prowess": "See article:\nCopy Technique\nJohan is a member of the fearsome Four Major Crews and is the leader of the crew \"God Dog\". Jace has stated that Johan, unlike the other crews, never needed a right-hand man or extra muscle to back him up.\n[\n3\n]\nJohan's true potential was always held back because he did not want to cause trouble for his mom by fighting. However, he finally decided to reach his fighting potential in order to save his mom from being stoned to death during the\nCult arc\n.\nMuch like\nDaniel Park\n, Johan is another character (the only other one besides these two is\nJinyoung Park\n) in the series who has been shown to be able to execute a technique perfectly just by having seen it once. This is shown when Johan mastered Zack's jabs just by seeing it in action once. A few years later he would use that very technique to save his mom's life, by jabbing stones thrown at her before they hit her. However, unlike Daniel, he seems to stick with the first fighting style he learned (boxing from Zack) and has only improved upon it, whereas Daniel switches between various fighting styles to better suit himself in a fight.\nJohan uses the same fighting style as Zack - boxing, heavily relying on speed and bursts of power to increase the force of his punches. Johan's talent even surpasses Zack, someone who has trained in boxing since he was young. He is faster than Zack, as stated by many characters, and was the first to beat Daniel in a race (albeit Daniel had run 3 miles prior to their race). He defeated Zack in a boxing match as his punches were too fast for Zack to dodge.\nAs displayed in his fights against Gun and Eli, he seems to lack the natural build of a fighter. While he looks like he has a weak physicality, he is actually quite strong.\n[\n4\n]\n, despite his build seemingly being more suited for speed. Johan can unleash all his energy in a single moment, creating immense burst power and strength enough to forcefully open a locked steel door, as seen in the\nAnimal Cruelty\narc.\nGun\n, a legendary fighter, chooses Johan as a candidate for his successor, but later disqualifies him. However, the only weakness he faced was that his physicality was lacking in comparison to his skill. Gun himself compares Johan to a computer with \"software (that) is cutting edge but... hardware from the 90s\", stating that in that regard, he is the opposite of Vasco, who possesses poor skill but high physical abilities.\nEver since his defeat at the hands of Gun, Johan has increased his physicality to the point where he could overpower\nSeth Lee\nin a contest of strength (someone who can bend metal rods with his thumb) while copying\nVasco\n. He has also managed to copy\nJake Kim\n's MMA flip, which he used on\nGoo\n.\nDespite these advances, Johan's eyes have degraded to some extent as well, whilst this doesn't cause a dramatic reduction in his fighting abilities. This led to him missing an attack on Zack Lee.\nIn Chapter 421 Johan gains the ability to imitate Daniel by using all of his muscles and nerves for a limit of ten seconds.\nIn the fight against Yuseong, Johan ended up being able to copy CQC (after a brief exchange with Manager Kim) and made Yuseong pass out with a combo from it (after the fight and wanting to take out Eugene). Also, the fact that Johan was having such an effect on Yuseong pshycology, Eugene was wondering if Johan was powerful beyond measure and that he might be stronger than Tom Lee .\nJohan's Infinite Technique\nThe Infinite Technique\nThis technique was the amalgamation of all the techniques Johan copied before his fight with Gun. The Technique is totally unpredictable and fluid as it was catching Gun Park off-guard. On getting inspiration from Tom Lee before\n\"Hunt for Gun\"\nJohan's fighting style improved a lot he fought on almost equal footing with an injured Gun using his\nCopy\n, who was still hard to be defeated, with his temporarily improved vision he almost sent Gun to his death point. Gun noticed that Johan merged his countless copied techniques into a single fighting style which caught even Gun Park off-guard. Gun reached the conclusion that Johan has finally found his own path and named this fighting style the\nInfinite technique.\nQuotes\n\"Spare me the bullshit. Friends? I've cut myself off from everyone. Even from my family, because I knew they were all useless. Without any power, you can't protect shit. Look.. look at what having no power gets you.\"\n[\n6\n]\nWithout any power, you can't protect shit.\n[\n7\n]\nTrivia\nHis name in English strictly translates to \"St. John\", which is notably a character in\nJane Eyre\n.\nHe is the only one of his friends to have asked for two wish bracelets, both of which are broken, but neither of which came true.\nJohan has a soft spot for animals, and is often seen with his dogs Miro and Eden.\nDespite stating that that he hated dogfights, Johan was seen using a human shield, and dirty boxing during the One Night arc.\nAfter God Dog arc, his left eye consistently becomes drawn as gray. This is later revealed to be the fact that Johan is going blind, much like his mother.\nJohan is implied to have learnt Taekwondo from\nSeong Taehoon\n, a character of Viral Hit, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.\n[\n8\n]\nJohan's distant relative\nHaru Seong\nused to cut their hair at his mothers shop but stopped cutting their hair as his mother is now blind, Haru Seong is a character from\nQuestism\n, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.\nJohan was requested to aid and did aid\nSuhyeon Kim\n, the protagonist of\nQuestism\n, because he was indebted to\nHaru Seong\nin some way. This significantly impacted the story of Questism.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\n2.0\n2.1\nWebtoon, Questism\nEpisode 151: Here He Comes\n\u2191\n3.0\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 259: One Night (2)\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 261: One Night (4)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 210: God Dog (12)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 242: Eli Jang (11)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 211: God Dog (13)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 324: One Night II (End)"

One of his wishes was for him to always protect her. They were good friends and went to church together along with Zack. They also attended the same middle school together. Later, he distances himself from her to keep her from knowing what happened to his mother.\nZack Lee\nZack beats up Johan's bullies\nHe and Zack were friends as a child. Sometimes Zack would visit his mother, along with him and Mira to get a haircut. He is shown to be in good terms with him and gave Johan a candy which he didn't like.\nJohan used to be jealous about Zack's strength. Zack used to protect Johan from bullies by beating them up. Johan used to be embarrassed by it, especially if Mira had witnessed it. He slowly tried to edge away from Zack to keep away from knowing what happened to his mother.\nDuring the middle school boxing championship, he was Zack's last opponent and surprisingly defeated him and won the championship. He humiliated him in front of Mira on purpose, souring their relationship and causing Zack to quit boxing. Despite this Zack still considers Johan a friend, and saves him from Gun at the end of the God Dog arc.\nDaniel Park\nJohan met Daniel Park (in his new body) when both were jogging with each of their dogs. They start talking and decide to race against each other. Surprisingly, Johan won but just barely. This was probably because Daniel had already ran 3 miles prior to their race.\nWhen their dogs went missing, both went to the bottom of it to recover their missing pets (as well as several other people's). Johan considers him as a friend and even asks Daniel to join the God Dogs. However, when Daniel rejects his offer he changes his mind about him.\n[\n1\n]\nJace Park\nDuring the One Night Arc, Johan and Jace form an uneasy alliance. Jace shows much kindness to Johan during this period while also massively respecting his great strength and prestige. During the duration of this deal, the duo mostly was willing to work with each other despite a couple of difficulties in Jace's eccentric planning and Johan's impatience. Jace described Johan as a ticking time bomb that was hard to keep under control.\n[\n2\n]\nNevertheless, they end the deal on equal terms but still not exactly friends.\nOther\nJong Gun\nGun first meets Johan in an alley to ask see if he would be a likely candidate for being his successor. He had heard about Johan's reputation - someone who works in the day and robs street thugs at night - before meeting him. Johan yearns to be Gun's successor so he can be high enough in position to move his mother up the waiting list for her eye surgery. After being abandoned by Gun, Johan became determined to beat him and take his position by force.\nCult Leader\nTBA\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 171\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 259"

        "background": "Johan grew up with his mother in a poor neighborhood; his father is never seen, though he was told by his mother he's in the US, it's later revealed his mother is a widow. He knew Zack and Mira because they all attended the same church, and he had faith in God until his life went downhill.\nJohan's mother supported Johan by working as a hair stylist in her own hair salon, but she lost many customers due to her growing blindness. She told Johan to behave in school because life was getting more difficult for them, and Johan grew resentful of how the other kids could act out of line without consequences while he had to worry about his behavior because of his mother.\nJohan was often bullied at his junior high school\n[\n1\n]\n, with Zack often stepping in to defend him. Just like Zack, he had a crush on Mira.\n[\n1\n]\nHowever, he gave up on her after the Cult arc.\nAfter he saved his mother from the cult, he disappeared to collect money for a cornea transplant to restore his mother's sight. Johan became infamous for stealing the shoes of people he fought (presumably selling them afterwards for money), an idea given in passing by\nSamuel Seo\nduring his time at Big\nDeal\n. Even after he collected all the money, his mother couldn't get the treatment because she was on a long waiting list. When Johan hears that Gun can save his mother, he trains under Gun to become his successor and is given the task of uniting the four crews.\nJohan created his crew,\nGod Dog\n, after dropping out of middle school. He took over\nJin Jang\n's old gang and conquered many other gangs in Gangbuk. He wanted to take over Gangdong, but lost in a fight to\nHostel\n's\nEli Jang\n. As a result, he was forced to give up the region to Hostel.\nJohan used his raw talent to further his crew's money making ability, but after repeated involvement with the members of J High School, his defeat to Gun and betrayal of Jin Jang he became the only God Dog; however, Johan and many other stated that he was the only God Dog from the start. The majority of God Dog was absorbed by\nBig Deal\n, leaving Johan to continue collecting money for his mother's treatment on his own. He really wants to come back home. But he is afraid that his mother will collapsed if she finds out that he has the same disease as hers.\nAnimal Cruelty\nJohan first appears in present time exercising with Eden. When Eden gets into a fight with Enu, he meets Daniel and the two begin chatting with each other. Johan hears Daniel talking down about his gang, so he initially decides to beat him. After witnessing Daniel's incredible stamina and strength, he decides against it.\nWhen the two of them get their dogs stolen, Daniel helps Johan look for his dog. Johan thanks Daniel and reveals that he is the leader of the God Dogs. Still hesitant, he decides to ask his second in command to confirm whether Daniel is a friend or not.\nGod Dog Arc\nWhen Jin Jang gets beaten by Vasco, he lies that Vasco wanted to start a gang war with Johan. Johan gets angry and decides to go to war with the Burn Knuckles. Johan sends his gang members to find the Burn Knuckles and pay them back. He approaches Vasco and challenges him to a fight, but Vasco refuses to fight back. Despite all of his fighting skills, Johan cannot overpower Vasco. He is angry and decides to leave.\nJohan asks Daniel to meet him in a park later, and offers him a position in God Dog, saying he trusts Daniel and that they will make a great team. Daniel refuses because he doesn't want to be a part of a gang. Johan gets angry and in response decides to beat Daniel before he is attacked by his gang mutinying, who say that they were never friends to begin with. Johan is in the middle of destroying his gang when Gun shows up to tell him he is disqualified from being his successor. Johan begs him to reconsider, but Gun refuses because he is terrible at leading his gang, let alone four gangs.\nJohan tries to fight Gun but he is tired and easily outmatched. Gun decides to take out his teeth when Zack interferes and begins fighting on Johan's behalf. He is stunned at how unified Daniel's friends are and how much they care about him, unlike his own gang. He decides to run away again, and breaks his wish bracelet as well.\nRunaway Fam Arc\nJohan comes to Gangdong to ask Olly Wang where Gun is. Olly begins teasing him, so they start fighting until Jerry Kwon breaks them up. Olly Wang offers Johan a meal if he sits down to talk business with them, and he agrees to come, but refuses to join Hostel.\nJin Jang asks Johan to help him get revenge, and if he does then he will tell him where Gun is. When he asks about Jake, Jin Jang says he will leave Jake out of their business. When the meal is done, Johan gets up to leave but is stopped by the waiter, who asks him to pay the bill. He is confused, because Olly Wang promised to pay the bill, but it turns out he lied.\nOne Night\nJohan boards a train to Cheongliang to meet the CEO of HNH group, who is also Gun's boss. He believes that if he reveals who he is and gives the money then he will help move his mother up the waiting list. On the way there, he spots Jace hanging out with a girl from Hostel. Confused at his intentions, he reveals to Jace that he is falling in love with an enemy member.\nJohan follows Jace to a restaurant so he can watch the news, and witnesses Seth Lee take the girl away. Jace approaches him to ask him to help find the girl and he refuses, because he doesn't trust Jace. Later on he reconsiders, and accepts to help him while emphatizing they are not friends: they are signing a contract, with Jace paying his meal, and Johan helping him out for that one night. The contract is for Johan an insurance so that Jace doesn't lie to him like Olly did.\nThe two of them wander around Cheongliang looking for the girl, first at a tea house, and then at a gambling house. When Seth Lee attacks Jace, Johan decides to fight him and wins. They make it to the girl, who is blocked by the uncles of Hostel. However, when they see Johan they get scared and clear the way for him to walk through. Jace asks Johan to stay and help some more but he refuses, because his contract is over.\nThe next day, Johan confronts the CEO. When he recognizes Johan as a gang leader he ignores him and tells Goo to take care of him. Goo kicks Johan's money out of his hands and Johan decides to fight him, but gets beaten badly. Before he leaves, Goo tells him that he stands a chance against Gun.\nHostel\nAs Johan was indebted to him, Jace asked him to watch over his friends in Gangdong and help them out if necessary. Johan watch from the top of a building the fight between team J High (Daniel, Zack, Vasco, Logan, Vin, Jay and Eli) with Hostel B, and team Hostel A, supported by Jerry Kwon and K House. At one point, Johan judges he should go down and help them, but seeing how things turn out with the arrival of Derek and Max, he decides his help is not needed and just leaves.\nWorkers (4th Affiliate)\nJohan\nvisits\nJustin\nand\nChuck\nat a food stall and asks if they know where\nGun\nis. They tell him they don't, and they're also too busy to search for him.\nZack\nsits down next to him and asks Johan if he's ready to go home now. Johan says he's never listened to Zack before, so the latter decides to beat him and take him home regardless.\nVS Johan Seong\nJohan and\nZack\nbegin fighting as Zack swears to bring him home. Johan is surprised to see how strong Zack became, but he is still stronger than him. He missed on one shot, and Zack realizes that Johan is going blind. When Zack asks why\nhis mother\nisn't enough of a reason to return, Johan tells Zack that revenge is all he has left. His mother will be heartbroken if she realizes that he is going blind as well. Zack swears to help Johan defeat\nGun\nand the\nfour crews.\nJohan goes to the White Tiger agency for an interview.\nJohan later goes to White Tiger Job Center to ask about\nGun's\nwhereabouts.\nTom Lee\nasks him to spar as practice, and Johan gets tossed around but is still standing. Tom is impressed by Johan, thinking that he had not expected to see someone as talented as\nGoo\nor Gun during his lifetime. Tom recruits Johan as an intern for his company, despite his protests.\nJake Kim\nAfter the\nchairman of Workers\nasked him on the phone to send his men back to the Workers,\nTom Lee\ndecides to send an intern (Johan) to the third affiliate.\nOne Night II\nSent to the third affiliate as White Tiger Company's intern, Johan enters in Vivi's room on Jake bullshitting his way into being hired by pretending to be the one sent by the White Tiger. Johan recognizes Jake, who then attempts to leave, but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar.\nJake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer to find more information about\nSinu\n. As Vasco is raising a commotion and fighting the guards, Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen. In reality, Xiaolung is setting them up for failure as he expects both of them to be defeated by Vasco. He doesn't trust the White Tiger because he thinks the chairman of Workers is using them to spy on the third affiliate.\nThe two of them confront Vasco, but he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo (\nTaehun Seong\n). Johan and Jake decide to take turns to fight Vasco, 10 minutes each.\nJohan is fighting well using only his taekwondo. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.\nJohan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them.\nClub\nJohan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers.\nAs Jake left with Daniel, believing he must know something about Sinu Han since he is a VVIP, Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.\nJohan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him.\nLater, Jake switch off with him as bouncer.\nWorkers (3rd Affiliate)\nZack, Vasco and Eli coming to rescue Daniel are blocked by Johan. He refuses to move since\nXiaolong\npromised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job. As the three are having a hard time fighting Johan, Vasco and Zack catch his legs to allow Eli to go ahead without them. When he disappears inside, Zack tells Vasco that he should go as well to help save people, although he is not sure if he can beat Johan.\nAs team J High and Big Deal's Jake, Jerry and Lineman are fighting their way up the building, Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he\u2019s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn\u2019t need help, since Johan is reliable enough.\nJohan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what\u2019s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.\nAs Xiaolung called for backup against the Big Deal's intruders, Johan makes  his way to Vivi\u2019s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he\u2019s working with the third affiliate when they\u2019re responsible for the Punsang cult. Sowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.\nHwang Ho and Vasco prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away.\nEli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan orders him to give the badge or else he will kill him.\nJohan throws Eli\u2019s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna\u2019s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.\nAs Samuel, Jake and Jerry are struggling against the drugged body of Big Daniel in ultra instinct, Samuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.\nJohan\u2019s past enemies and friends hype up how powerful he is as he\u2019s fighting Daniel\u2019s UI form, with Samuel and Jake watching. UI Daniel uses the kyokushin and a triple kick on Johan, followed by systema and capoeira. While Johan is simply copying moves, Daniel has mastered them. Johan does know that he's outmatched, but he keeps fighting in order to gain some experience for fighting Gun, until he is eventually overpowered.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 132: Cult (01)"

When she sees Daniel (in his new body), she becomes completely smitten and gazes at him after he comes out of the van, which angers Beom. When he observes the way she models so that he could get an idea of what to do, Joy becomes flattered and embarrassed.\nEpisode 72\nAfter watching Daniel in smite and adoration, Joy finally introduces herself to him as his Pacebook friend/follower. She then models with Daniel for 'Kian Clothing Shop' for free since she's a freelancer model. When they wear similarly matching clothes, she states that they look like a couple which Daniel hesitantly agrees with. The coordinator offers to repay her in some way and she states that he could pay for dinner for her and Daniel. During dinner, the three of them eat crab soup. Daniel, since he's only had crab legs in his soup because of the financial struggle his mother went through, gets confused and asks why there's the whole body of a crab in the soup. This confuses both Joy and the coordinator of 'Kian Clothing Shop'. Beom tries to call Joy but she declines him anyway, stating that he's too persistent.\nPTJ Entertainment Arc\nJoy is introduced a trainee who is part of the same class, Class C, as Daniel and Duke.

        "synopsis": "Episode 180\nJiho\ngrows accustomed to the fact that he is now in juvie. He enters the cell and is intimidated by the inmates, but realizes that they are scared of him. There is a color system in juvie, and he is a rank above them because he is there for violent crime. There are four ranks in juvenile prison:\nWhite (petty crime; theft, scams)\nYellow (violent crime: rape, attempted murder)\nRed (actual murder)\nBlue (drug offenses)\nJiho's cellmate\nDarius\norders him to clean the toilets because he is a newbie and Jiho obliges until he realizes he is a rank about him. He protests that he does not need to be treated like this and Darius removed his shirt to reveal he is also the same rank as Jiho.\nEpisode 181\nJiho is made to do all the tasks in his cell because he is the newbie. He gets the worst conditions but puts up with it because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. While in prison he spots a plant in his room and takes care of it, telling it to be strong like him. Wally Lee returns from solitary confinement and is placed in Jiho's cell. He is happy to see his plant is watered.\nMeanwhile, Darius begins working out, which is illegal in juvie. He tells Jiho to keep guard but he falls asleep, and all the inmates get demerits. The inmates hold him down and prepare to beat him but Wally intervenes with a sawed toothbrush, telling them to back off.\nEpisode 182\nWally stabs Darius and begins fighting him. Darius kicks him and Wally bites his foot and is sent to solitary. After the incident Jiho finds his life improving by a lot. He realizes that Wally is protecting him, but doesn't know what for. He begins to neglect the plant.\nJiho wakes up in the middle of the night to find Darius in his sheets. He tells Darius to stop being a freak, and Darius starts beating him. Two hours later Jiho's roommates cannot sleep because he is still crying. When Wally returns, Jiho is happy to see him. Wally is distressed that his plant is dying, and turns his rage towards Jiho.\nEpisode 183\nWally tries to kill Jiho but is stopped by the prison guards. Jiho begins pulling his hair in self harm to cope with his stress. As Jiho is sitting in the cafeteria Darius begins bullying him, tossing his fish at Jiho. Brad Lee slams his face with his tray for splattering\nJake Kim\n, who is sitting nearby. Darius challenges Jake but backs off when he sees who he is fighting. After Jake beats him he claims Jake is innocent, and begins bullying Jiho.\nIn Jiho's cell he witnesses Darius step on a bug, saying that he will be back to beat Jiho more. The bug does not die, but gets up after the beating. Jiho finds hope that he can survive his situation. In the bathroom, Jiho sneaks up on Darius who is taking a shower with a blunt weapon and decides to attack him.\nEpisode 184\nJiho is placed in solitary confinement for attacking Darius. As he is in solitary, Jiho starts devolving mentally and physically. He starts self harming and they have to handcuff him and shave his head. He is tormented by the faces of the people he's hurt in the past, like Daniel, James and Darius.\nAs Jiho screams in agony he hears a neighbor tell him to shut up and stop putting himself down. Jiho begins speaking to the neighbor and he encourages Jiho to fight back and that he did nothing wrong in the past. Jiho gains the courage to fight Darius, and challenges him in the yard.\nEpisode 185\nThe prisoners take bets on how long Jiho will last, and Jake is the only one to bet on Jiho winning the match. Darius brutally beats Jiho but every time Jiho falls he gets back up. Jiho begins fighting dirty, biting Darius's nose and spitting his loose teeth into his eye. As Darius is blinded, Jiho grabs his bandage and begins to choke him. Jiho is stopped by the prison guards and is happy to have won the fight. Jake bribes the guards and smiles at Jiho, stating he was the only one who won in this situation.\nCookie 1\nJiho is being moved to Jake's cell. As he is finished beating the inmates, he asks Jake why he bet on him. Jake tells him it was his eyes that sold him.\nCookie 2\nJiho being released from solitary. As he walks away he looks into his neighbor's cell and tells him he will come back for him. The neighbor tells him not to worry because he will be fine. That neighbor was Jiho's old self.\nNotes\n\"The eyes that wanted to kill him\" is a phrase repeated a lot from this arc on, like the\nEli Jang arc\nIt is implied that Darius sexually assaulted Jiho in Episode 182. It was later confirmed in a PTJ blog post.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "synopsis": "Episode 264\nRiley Oh\nis placed in\nDarius\n's cell after he was arrested for prostitution scams. He notices that nobody in the cell has eyebrows and is unnerved by it. Riley wants to appear tough, so he challenges Darius for dominance. Darius takes offense and decides to discipline Riley.\nMr. Kim\nhas begun his evaluations and is concerned about Riley, who is hysterical and begs him to save him from the cell leader. He questions Darius about his desires in an attempt to connect to him, but Darius tries to sexually harass him. Wally also proves to be unstable and tries to choke Mr. Kim on the orders of the cell leader. The only normal person is\nJiho\n, who draws a cute picture of a house and says he likes Mr. Kim's fidget spinner. Mr. Kim takes the drawing to be a sign that Jiho craves affection, and tells Jiho that he is a good kid and shouldn't lose himself.\nWhen Mr. Kim talks to the prison guards they say they cannot move Jiho from his cell. He is angry because he thinks Jiho will be harassed by Darius, who he thinks is the leader of the cell. The guards tell him that Jiho is the leader of the cell, and that he is not a nice kid. In his cell, Jiho is shown shaving the eyebrows of Riley and enjoying the terrified look on his face.\nIn the prison yard, the leaders of the cells are fighting each other for a position in\nBig Deal\n. Jason Yoon and Brad Lee recommend one fighter based on his strength, but that fighter is overwhelmed by a sneak attack from Jiho.\nJake\nis pleased with Jiho's development but his underlings are not. Once Jake leaves, Jason attacks Jiho and tells him off for fighting dirty. Jiho doesn't care about fairness and says he can beat Jason as well. Jason challenges Jiho to beat him, and Jiho accepts.\nLater in a woodshop Jiho appears behind Jason, who is cutting wood. He asks if Jiho plans to push him like he pushed Daniel. Jiho says that the only thing he regrets about pushing\nDaniel\nis that he did not get someone else to do it for him. At these words, Wally pushes Jason into the saw.\nEpisode 265\nJason Yoon is saved from the saw by the juvenile prison guards. Mr. Kim watches as Jiho and Wally are taken into custody. He tries to convince one of the guards that Jiho was not to blame for the incident, but the guard does not buy it. He shows Mr. Kim photographs of Jiho's victims as evidence of his sadistic personality. The guard believes Jiho is pretending to be kind until a decision to release him is made, but Mr. Kim insists that he is innocent because his picture showed an unconscious desire for warmth.\nIn the prison yard Jiho is being beaten by Brad Lee as revenge for his attack on Jason Yoon. Brad describes to Jiho that what makes Big Deal great is its idealism. He tells Jiho off for his cruelty, but Jiho insists that the only way he can win is to fight savagely. Jake takes Jiho's side and allows him into Big Deal, kicking out Jason because he lost. Brad is sad that Jake is changing, and wonders what to tell Jerry.\nIn the cafeteria Mr. Kim sits down with Jiho and asks him to turn himself in. He mentions that Jiho used to be different in high school, and tells him he can change. Jiho tells Mr. Kim that he has left his old self behind and knocks him out with his food tray. Guards swarm in and Brad thinks it is over for Jiho, but the inmates confess to his crime instead of Jiho. Brad sees the dangerous level of influence Jiho had on the inmates and is afraid that Jiho will lead to the destruction of Big Deal.\nCookies\nCookie 1 occurs directly after Jiho knocks out Mr. Kim. As he stands over his body, he places the fidget spinner in his mouth and smiles that he completed the picture. The picture that Mr. Kim thought was of a house was actually a picture of himself with the spinner in his mouth, foreshadowing the violence Jiho had towards the counselor.\nCookie 2 is Jiho standing after having beaten a number of inmates. He kept the fidget spinner from Mr. Kim and affirms that he doesn't need to be strong, he just needs to win.\nCookie 3 is the guards deciding who to release. They decide between Jiho or Jake.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

When his appearance was finally revealed, his hairstyle was notably similar to the one seen worn by Daniel Park's second body in the dream. He also carries with him a hatchet wherever he goes.\nWhen he arrived in Korea, he wears a red polo shirt with white stripes, dark gray pants kept with silver chains that holds a brown smoking pipe with a silver lighter and black pants These items are told to be items descended from Gapryong Kim himself to his children- who Kitae killed.",
        "personality": "Minseon Kang\u2019s terse verdict\u2014describing Kitae as\n\u201cthe evil side\u201d\nof Gapryong Kim\u2014offers perhaps as the most accurate lens through which to understand him. He is not simply a violent man; he is the concentrated core of his father\u2019s ferocity, stripped of any pretense of conscience, loyalty, or restraint. Where Gapryong Kim\u2019s strength carried a semblance of purpose, Kitae embodies the same force liberated from any ethical boundary.\nA closer examination of his behavior reveals not just a killer, but a psychopath so utterly habituated to his own depravity that atrocity becomes mundane. For Kitae, violence is not a reaction to conflict but a fundamental expression of existence. He does not kill because he must, but because his inner world places no inherent value on human life. His willingness to butcher anyone with a hatchet speaks volumes: he favors violence in its rawest, most personal incarnation\u2014face to face, immersed in the victim\u2019s final moments.\nOne of the clearest glimpses into his psyche comes from a single act: his casual walk through the streets of Seoul, his clothes soaked in fresh blood. This scene exposes a man utterly indifferent to social order and consequence. The fear of authority, the sting of guilt, the shame that might haunt lesser criminals\u2014none of these apply to him. His only reflection on the aftermath is tellingly neutral: he notes, almost analytically, that Korean police operate \u201cquickly,\u201d contrasting it with his experiences in Mexico. To him, a murder scene is not a moral reckoning but a logistical detail to be catalogued for future reference.",
        "relationships": "0th Generation\nGapryong Kim\nAnalyzing Kitae Kim\u2019s connection to his father, Gapryong Kim, demands an admission that their \u201crelationship\u201d never fit any sane definition of \u201cfather and son.\u201d\nFrom the moment Kitae clawed his way into the world, he was branded filth in flesh\u2014a bastard spawned from the moment of a great man\u2019s weakness, an aberration that mocked the legacy of the \u201cFist\u201d more than it upheld it. In a society where bloodline sanctifies identity, Kitae was not heir, but a shameless wound left to rot in plain sight\u2014a living proof that even someone like the almighty \u201cFist\u201d could rot from within.\nHis resentment then, is not some petty grudge born of paternal neglect. It is the logical byproduct of a world that exiles the illegitimate as if they carry disease. The damage calcified into purpose. In Tijuana, where the Kim name meant nothing, he underwent a violent rebirth. What emerged was not a runaway son, but a man who became his own god, enthroned atop an empire of blood and terror.\nPatricide was the crowning honor of this self-made myth. Though the public record brands James Lee the killer,\nJinyoung Park\u2019s\ndelirious confession\u2014that Kitae himself ended the Fist\u2019s life\u2014strips the lie bare. He did not simply murder a father; he obliterated a monument. His father\u2019s final breath was a boy\u2019s last, desperate plea to be\nseen\n.\nAnd yet the corpse did not silence the hunger. If anything, death only metastasized it. Kitae\u2019s obsession bloomed into ritual: hunting half-brothers scattered like filth across Gapryong\u2019s secret life, tearing them apart not merely to kill, but to hoard every scrap of fatherly affection they clung to that he was denied of. By murdering them and tearing their keepsakes from their corpses, he desecrates them and feeds on their ghosts, stealing the father he could not inherit in life in an attempt to feel whole again.\nThus, to call Kitae\u2019s connection to Gapryong merely \u201cbad\u201d is a coward\u2019s understatement. What binds him is not just resentment, but an obsessive, cannibalistic need for him. His empire is a mausoleum built atop Gapryong\u2019s bones. Every corpse Kitae leaves rotting beneath foreign sun is an offering to him\u2014a hope that somewhere beneath the blood and ruin, his father will look back through dead eyes and know him at last.\n1st Generation\nJames Lee\nAt some point in the past, before the developments of Cheonliang, James Lee killed Gapryong Kim, with Kitae being implied to have helped him. He would then go to Mexico for an extended period, returning to South Korea to dethrone Jichang Kwak upon James' request, before returning to the Americas.\nThough the two are suggested to have once worked under Charles Choi along with\nGun Park\nand\nGoo Kim\nto create the Four Major Crews, how their relationship developed afterward is still unclear. James Lee and Gitae Kim appear to be on friendly terms, as seen in the Cheonliang Flashback.",

        "fighting_prowess": "Daniel Park copying Kitae's brutal strikes in Ultra Instinct\nHis combat power is said by\nGongseob Ji\nto be \"the peak of the 1st Generation\", therefore, he was one of the few kings who along with Jichang Kwak (albeit for different reasons, Jichang spared out of pity), had nothing taken away by\nJames Lee\n. (However, this could also be attributed to the two being on the same side during the 1st generation.).\nFurthermore, his fighting style does not seem to possess a specific \"technique,\" instead embodying raw strength and speed. He is described to have the speed of Gongseob Ji and the power of Taesoo Ma in his fists by Jichang Kwak during their fight while heavily holding back. Kitae also possesses enough power to mirror Jichang's hand blade, though rather than chopping with the side of his hand, he stabbed the side of Jichang's hand itself by only using his fingers, digging underneath the skin up to Kitae's second knuckle.\nLater in the Busan arc, Gitae has demonstrated\nMastery\nin Resistance\n, coming out practically unharmed from all the attacks he has suffered to date. The only one who has injured him was Jinrang when he surpassed his limits after witnessing the death of his brothers, reaching a new level of\nConviction\n, and even then the damage was superficial. Even when several police officers used tasers on him and discharged a shock throughout his body, he remained unperturbed until calmly answering a cell phone.\nIt has been noted that Kitae tries to imitate others, though rather than being the true copying talent, as held by Jinyoung Park and Johan Seong, Kitae's imitation is just a cheap facsimile, instead supplementing his lack of talent with pure brute force, shown when he tried to imitate Jichang Kwak's handblade.\nQuotes\nJichang Kwak, huh?

        "appearance": "Lang Jin appears to be a tall and muscular man in either his late twenties or early thirties. He has sunken black eyes, scruffy black hair with a short goatee accompained by a moustache, as well a unusual scar below his left eye that resembles scales. Upon his release from prison, he is shown wearing a black polo shirt under a dark gray business suits and black pants (he occasionally wears a white shirt instead). He also wears golden-yellow rings on both hands that read 'Busan' and 'Purgatory'. After his fight against Kitae Kim, Lang permanently lost his left arm after having it get chopped off by the former King.\nHis trademark part of his appareance is the large tattoo on his back shaped like a realistic wolf head.",
        "personality": "An unwanted person since birth, without even having a name, Lang Jin grew up being raised to never disobey those at the top of the hierarchy and to obey them like a dog. Thus, Lang in the past was someone without any ambition or prospects for growth in life, doing the minimum to live and the possible to protect\nJungseok Hwang\nand\nSang Baek\n, who he considers his little brothers.\nFor a long time, Lang maintained this lifestyle and thinking, until he heard\nJichang Kwak's\nscolding, which made him realize that his lack of ambition and perspective kept him hostage to fate, which also affected his little brothers. After that, he fights against Dayoung Oh, ceasing to be a dog and consolidating himself as the \"Wolf\".\nLater, Lang extends his protective personality to all of Busan. And after returning from prison, he shows great hatred towards James Lee and anyone who threatens Busan or\nhis family\n.\nHe is also very charismatic, and not without mercy, such as his fight against Gongseob Ji, he showed mercy when the latter was down and unable to get back up. He is also a capable leader, being able to boost the positive energy within the people of Busan after he defeated the previous King of Busan; gaining the respect of all of Busan's people.",
        "fighting_prowess": "As the first champion of the Busan underworld and one of the kings of the 1st Generation, Lang Jin is one of the strongest characters in the series, being feared and respected throughout Busan. He easily took down two members of the Allies with just one blow each without them having time to react, applying enough force to dent a steel container and open a crater in a concrete floor with the force of his blows. He is powerful enough to fight simultaneously against the kings of\nDaegu\nand\nAnsan\n, having the upper hand for most of the fight by withstanding their strongest attacks without faltering while inflicting heavy damage on them. He was so powerful that even\nDaniel Park\nhad to use the fighting style of the former\nKing of Seoul\n. Despite being in his perfect body fighting against Jinrang - who was injured by the previous fight against two kings of the 1st Generation, Daniel still proved to be inferior in an exchange of blows with the King of Busan, who surpassed him in both strength and endurance.\nUsing the Gapryong Kim Style, he can wield the rare\nMastery\nof Conviction\n, which allows him to surpass his limits with his strong will to protect those he cares about, even delivering very powerful and destructive punches capable of destroying the strongest defenses and even overcoming users of the\nMastery of Resistance\nand inflicting critical damage.\nLang Jin, even injured and tired from previous fights, managed to remain conscious after an attack by\nGitae Kim\nand after witnessing the death of his foster brothers Baek and Hwang to protect him, Lang reached a new level of \"Conviction\" represented by the intense purple glow in his eyes and his scar that increased his strength, speed and resistance to the point of pressuring and even forcing Gitae to keep his guard up to protect himself from his attacks that were hurting him and making him bleed, something that none of the other characters in the work managed to do. The power of his punches were so strong that the bones in his arms were beginning to break with each blow exerting a force greater than his body could withstand.\nWolf Style\nLang Jin's fighting style consists of using his elbows to fight in close quarters for both offense and defense, being compared to \"fangs\" being able to cut and inflict serious damage to the Kings of Daegu and Ansan and easily block most of their attacks.\nGapryong Kim Style\nLang Jin's true strength lies in his fists. As a former disciple of\nGapryong Kim\n, he learned from him his techniques and fighting style, which consisted of charging his fists with\nConviction\n: the desire to protect. His punches were so powerful that with just one blow he was able to knock out the King of Daegu in a counterattack. Even Daniel Park's copying ability proven to be ineffective when he tried to copy this style, as he only replicated the movements but not the \"Conviction\" behind the punches, which led to Lang describing them as \"Empty Fists\". At the height of his fight against Gitae, Jirang reached a new level of \"Conviction\" that surpassed all his limits where his punches became so powerful that the bones in his hand broke with the impact of his blows that pressured Gitae to raise his guard to protect himself as they were capable of injuring him and making him bleed.\nGallery\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 468\n- Daniel copying Jinrang\nBusan\nEp. 529\n- Lang Jin's First Appearance\nLang Jin Full Body 1\nLang Jin Back\nEp. 530\nEp. 539\nJinrang's Choice\nReferences"

        "fighting_prowess": "Logan is immensely powerful and strong, able to beat three upperclassmen who were twice his size. He has a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience when it comes to fighting. Logan is powerful in all areas (speed, strength, technique, and power), but his defense is most likely the most significant and distinguished factor which Logan, as an individual, is overwhelmingly best at.\nLogan has a body that is perfect for any way of fighting he chooses but focuses most on power and strength since his body allows him to deliver blows with immense strength. Despite his huge stature, Logan is capable of moving at incredible speeds. He was even able to surprise\nZack\n(a fighter well known for his speed) with a lightning-quick tackle that won him the fight. Even a tactical approach that focuses on technique is possible for Logan due to his experience in fighting. Best of all is his unbelievable endurance, which is one of the most impressive shows to date. Logan was able to fight 3 of the Jae Won high's top fighters all in one day with no desire to back down. He is able to endure hard jabs and punches, seen when he took multiple shots to the face from Zack without inflicting serious damage.\nLogan has exceptional knowledge over wrestling and demonstrated it in when he tackled Zack after transferring to J High School.\n[\n7\n]\nOne of his signature fighting tactics is to jab his targets straight into the solar plexus. He has demonstrated this many times to\nDaniel\n,\nZack\n,\nVasco\n, and\nVin Jin\n.\nWhen he had decided to lose weight Logan was faster than Zack Lee but had none of the endurance and strength he once had, thus becoming a punching bag for the entire school.\nAs noted by Goo during the Hostel Arc Logan has the ability to adapt to one's fighting style, especially if it is weapon oriented, this combined with his jiu-Jitsu, emphasis on dogfighting, his reliance and use of weaponry made him a true monster.\n[\n8\n]\nIn fact, his endurance is so strong he can even fully recharge his stamina after 30 minutes of rest.\n[\n9\n]\nQuotes\n\"One shot, one kill\" - Episode 1\nTrivia\nAfter falling in love with Zoe, he was left heartbroken after realizing she was with someone else. After nearly a month, he returns to the school having lost 100\u00a0kg. Not only did he lose much of his body mass and muscle (Tattoos of Buddha becoming Gandhi, and a carp into a minnow), but he also became handsome.\n[\n4\n]\nThough he realized how wonderful it is to be handsome and be able to influence others, he also became aware of how weak he has become. Despite being more attractive to Zoe, he was rejected for his attitude and returned with an even bigger weight and bigger tendency for violence.\n[\n10\n]\nHe has an incredible sense of technique, that combined with immense power and size makes him one of the most prominent fighters in the story. Whilst he has held his own against the likes of Vasco, Vin, Jay, Daniel, and Zack; the only fight that he has presumably lost was against Goo. During the Stalker Arc, Goo was seen confronting him due to Lee beating up multiple seniors who were collecting money from the lowerclassmen students, which caused trouble to Gun and Goo's business. Logan later stated that Goo almost broke his shoulder during their fight, and was seen with several bruises and marks on his face in the aftermath when Logan was told that he was transferring schools\nLogan is often described as a bear on peak of food chain. However, he is depicted as a raptor when he is furious.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 120: Stalker (Conclusion)\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 442: Funeral\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 128: First Love (02)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 122: Second Year (2/2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 126: Troubled Transfer (Finale)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 125: Troubled Transfer (03)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 270: Hostel [Jay Hong vs Logan Lee]\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 275: Hostel (6)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 131: First Love (Conclusion)"

        "background": "Logan at a young age\nDuring his middle school years, he once dated\nMae's ex-girlfriend\nand was considered the King. One day, he was excited to meet his girlfriend after school and hoped to meet her so he could give her a present. He tried to text her in a 'manly' way, asking if she wanted to meet. His girlfriend replied, saying that they couldn't meet because she had a curfew. Not believing this excuse so easily, he replied again repeating his question. Logan looked up to see his girlfriend sitting with another guy across the park. He overheard their conversation in which they were insulting him behind his back and talking about how they should reveal that they're a couple.\nLogan's first Appearance in chapter 1\nLogan, enraged at his two-faced girlfriend who cheated on him and her boyfriend (who pretended to care about him), punched both of them in the face. From that day onward, he had an inferiority complex around attractive guys and hated girls when it came to romance because he thought that they were shallow people who only care about looks.\nExposition\nLogan and a girl are smoking in the bathroom together. He tells Daniel that if a teacher came, Daniel had to use his fat body to stop him. he tells Daniel to act like Pikachu to amuse himself, and puts his wet shoe to Daniel's face to kick him into the urinal.\nIn the classroom, he nails Daniel in the stomach. His friend laughs with him because he made Daniel faint. Daniel abruptly gets up when he is told to imitate Pikachu, and he imitates Pikachu's thunderbolt move on command. Upon request, he lets his friend borrow Daniel for the day to deliver a gift for a 100th day anniversary.\n[\n1\n]\nPavlov's Dog Arc\nHe fights Daniel and loses.\nTroubled Transfer Arc\nHe enters to bathroom, mumbling \"watashiwa\" to himself because the class he was in kept repeating it. Jin Vin and the others in the bathroom hear him and make fun of him for it, and they say he must have been from the comics department.\nJin Vin licks his finger and rubs it on one of Logan's tattoos. Logan asks if he was trying to start something, and Jin Vin just laughs at him, not taking the threat seriously. Jin Vin attempts to spin Logan onto the floor, but Logan grabs him and headbutts him instead. Jin Vin's glasses break and he covers his eyes. Jay-gal Gong sees how Logan took down Jin Vin and is shocked that someone in his department would have skill.\nLogan tries to move Jin Vin's eyes away to see his face, but Jin Vin is stubborn and refuses to let anyone see. Teachers come before Logan can finish. Logan goes out the window before he can get caught, and the teachers only see Jin Vin, his two friends, and a broken window.\n[\n2\n]\nJay-gal Gong later goes to Logan and asks to be his friend. Logan slaps him and tells him to avert his eyes. He then stands up and tells everyone not to step out of line, or else they'll be crushed. Jay-gal happily thinks that the comics department could rise. He offers Logan a box f apple juice later in the day, and while Logan thinks that he's annoying, he might also be useful to have around.\nJay-gal sees Zack around, and he gets the idea of starting a fight between Zack and Logan. Logan ends up angry at Zack, and he pours food on Mira. Once Zack had made sure Mira was alright, he throws the first fist at Logan. Logan ends up tackling Zack to the ground and Zack screams, alerting Vasco.\n[\n3\n]\nIn the cafeteria, Mira returns and steps in front of Zack to defend him. Logan grabs the girl's hair, but Zack gets up and punches him from under the jaw. Before Zack and Logan can get back into their fight, Vasco grabs Logan's shoulder and tells them not to fight. He squeezes Logan's shoulder and Logan falls to the ground.\nJin Vin also returns in a new pair of goggles, and he steps into the door and demands a rematch from Logan. In the end, Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin all challenge Logan to fight. Logan comments that the three are a balance of technique, strength, and speed. He thinks that the school is fun. He takes off his shirt and tells all of them to bring it on. This moment was Logan's debut at the new school.\nDaniel shivers as he remembers how Logan bullied him at his old school. Jay glances at Logan, who was the cause of Daniel's shaking. Daniel goes to the nurse for his shaking. Later, Daniel and Logan are on opposite sides of the door to the nurse, and they are about to open it.\n[\n4\n]\nFirst Love Arc\nLogan Lee tells Daniel to get out of his way when he walks into the door. He doesn't recognize Daniel, but gets instantly angry at him when Zoe tries to get close to Daniel. He grabs Daniel by the shoulder and is surprised to see that Daniel doesn't immediately collapse. He thinks to himself that Daniel was stronger than Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin. Daniel kneels regardless because it was conditioned in him to kneel down to Logan. Logan is confused and wonders if Daniel was faking it.\nZoe demands that Logan let him go. He thinks that the girls in the school were also very brave. Logan tells her to get lost, and that she only cared about whether or not a guy had a nice face. Zoe yells out loud that she liked \"the piggy\", and that makes Logan release Daniel. He looks at Zoe and tells her that she was crazy and leaves. He doesn't believe that she would like Daniel in his original body.\n[\n5\n]\nAfter the incident, Logan can't stop thinking about Zoe. He decides that if he confesses, she would return his feelings because he was more attractive than back then. When he turns the corner, he overhears Zoe saying that she was lying about liking Daniel's first body, which was a lie. However, he believes it and changes his mind about confessing. He cries on the bench instead and chooses to miss school.\nHe misses school for a month and only returns when Jay-gal calls him. He lost a considerable amount of weight and looks handsome according to the girls.\n[\n6\n]\nLogan enters the comics classroom, and a few girls watch him go in. After class, he thinks that people used to look at him in disgust, but now they looked at him in fondness. He goes behind a wall to smoke. The girls who were watching him catch up to him and ask him for a cigar. He tells them to leave him alone and they swoon, thinking he's playing hard to get. He gets extremely confused by their flirting.\nHe goes into the bathroom to examine himself. He says the carp tattoo on his arm changed into an anchovy and the buddha on his stomach into a gandhi. Two guys make fun of him, but instantly apologize after he glares at them. The two guys don't recognize him anymore. He thinks that his world had completely changed, even though he didn't act differently he was treated differently. Logan thinks that he could now confess to Zoe because he became handsome.\nHe doesn't see her, but he sees Mira. He drapes his arm around her because he thinks she'd like him, but Zack throws a bottle of Coke at him.\n[\n7\n]\nZack no longer recognizes him. Logan starts by tackling Zack in the same hold, and happily thinks that he has gotten much faster because he is so light. However, he is unable to lift Zack up anymore so Zack punches him in the jaw and he is much more strongly affected than before. His fighting style no longer suited his new figure.\nHe uncounters Jin Vin in the hall who also doesn't remember him and gets knocked out. When he wakes up, Vasco, who doesn't remember him either tries to help him up.Logan threatens him and Vasco sighs. He walks away with Jace when his help is refused. Jay-gal says that Logan no longer looks like a master. They fight, and Logan struggles to beat Jay-gal, although he could usually win without effort.\nHe continues to try to find Zoe, but a classmate says she is sick. He peers inside a classroom and sees a familiar head, mistaking Crystal for Daniel's original body. He says \"Pikachu\" out loud. Logan walks up to Crystal, and only then does he realize that it is not Daniel. She insults him, and he lifts his hand up to slap her, but is grabbed by Daniel.\n[\n8\n]\nThis starts a fight between Daniel and Logan. Daniel dodges every punch that Logan throws. He uses a \"body blow\", taught indirectly by Logan to beat him. Logan is left on the ground as Daniel leads Crystal away.\nZoe finally appears at school and she helps him up. He asks for her number and she gives it to him. Zoe thinks that he is extremely handsome. They go out for juice, and Logan asks her out, but she declines. She says it's because she hated his personality. She then leaves because she sees Daniel's original body. Logan passes out from shame.\nHe returns to school bigger and more violent than before. He no longer values being handsome.\n[\n9\n]\nDaniel Park Arc\nA group of God Dogs see him and asks him if he knew of the Burn Knuckles. Zoe seems him afterwards and puts a pink band-aid on his knuckles when she sees that they are bleeding. Zoe somehow still does not remember him. He then remembers how she said she liked Daniel's original body, and that leads him to the conclusion that Zoe liked him because she liked pigs.\nHe passes by an alley of beat up people. He picks one up and asks the person whether he's handsome or ugly, and gets inconclusive results.\nLogan tries to find Zoe. He sees her at the convenience store that Daniel worked in and looms over the window threateningly.\n[\n10\n]\nHe is surprised to see his past slave. He drags Daniel into an alley and beat him. He asks if Daniel had slept with Zoe, and Daniel says that he wasn't dating her. Logan then takes out his phone and tells Daniel to give him Zoe's number. When Daniel refuses, he is beat up more by Logan. Zoe sees them and throws her shoe at Logan. She defends Daniel, and Logan walks away in defeat.\nHowever, he goes back to the store at night and beats Daniel and takes his phone. He finds Zoe's number in it. Using Daniel's phone, he lures Zoe to a playground. He continues using Daniel's phone to text Zoe. The next day, he tells Daniel to get Zoe to the rodeo. That night, he wears fresh clothes and has a bouquet of red flowers. Someone taps him on the back and he thinks that it's Zoe, but it's the same group of God Dogs from before.\nLogan ends up fighting again against the God Dogs.\n[\n11\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 1\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 123\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 125\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 126\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 128\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 128\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 129\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 130\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 131\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 188\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 189"

        "appearance": "Luah Lim is a slender girl with fair skin and long hair. Her hair is straight and falls to her mid-back. It is mostly soft black in colour, with the underside of it and a few strands being paler. A section of her bangs on her left side, in particular, consists of these pale strands.\nHer features are proportionate and in accordance with the golden ratio. She has an oval face that narrows into a pointed chin, and large eyes that are a luminous purplish-brown. They are ringed by black lashes, and above them are her eyebrows, which are straight and dark.",
        "personality": "Capable and well-informed, Luah Lim is a valued member of\nBig Deal\nfor her intelligence gathering. She is skilled at what she does, having been the principle cause behind\nGun\n's praise of the gang's ability to collect information. She also possesses the capacity to apply the knowledge which she gleans to real-world scenarios, correctly identifying\nJohan Seong\nfrom little more than his \"baby face\"\n[\n1\n]\nand \"aura of strength.\"\nHowever, Luah demonstrates a certain degree of impulsive behavior. She physically intervenes to save\nEden\ndespite lacking the power to effectively fight off the dog's tormentors\n[\n2\n]\n, and flings Johan's phone into a body of water to prevent him from answering a call from the\nWhite Tiger Job Centre\n[\n3\n]\n.

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nJ High School\nZack Lee\nIt has been revealed that Zack has a crush on her. She seems to be neutral, or even accepting of this, but still acts very shy about it. Zack and Mira care about each other a lot and often spend time with each other. Mira dislikes when Zack fights in public or makes a scene, often pulling him away from the conflict and scolding him for it later.\nWhen the two of them go to the library together later, Zack promises not to fight that day, but ends up getting into a conflict with a group of bullies at the library who decide to pick on him and eat the Honey BBQ chips Zack brought to give to Mira, which are her favorite. He lets it go at the insistence of Mira, but ends up fighting the leader of the group when he gropes Mira.\nMira is a little upset that Zack didn't keep his promise, but later that night in a text she hints that she is happy he defended and protected her and that she forgives him.\nDaniel Park\nWhen Daniel first met her in his original body, he thought she was flirting with him when she smiles at him. Actually, she was only trying to apologize for Zack's aggressive behaviour. She is friendly with Daniel in his new body, and is part of the friend group that he hangs out with.\nJasmine Huh\nMira gave Jasmine another chance and is very friendly with her, despite of the fact that she framed Vasco. She tries to help her whenever she can and she is not aware that Jasmine actually uses her and her friendship.\nFriend\nJohan Seong\nJohan is Mira's and Zack's childhood friend. She and Johan attended the same church. Johan also has a crush on Mira. They were tight friends. Mira was upset when Johan slowly distanced himself away from her. She tried to make up for it by visiting his mother and his salon. She also prayed and hoped that they would continue to be close friends."

        "background": "Zack Lee\n,\nJohan Seong\nand Mira had known each other since they were little. The two boys had been in love with her ever since they were young, but Mira never seemed to directly reciprocate.\nMira had met Johan in a church she used to attend regularly and thus they became friends. She is still somewhat religious, as she prayed before a meal during lunch.\n[\n1\n]\nShe seems to come from a well off family.\nExposition\nChapter 2\nMira meets Daniel on the streets after Daniel in his original body, had just gotten a haircut. Daniel thought his haircut had made him very handsome, but he just looked like Kim Jong-un. When Daniel finds Mira looking at him, he thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her.\nZack sees Daniel smile at Mira and thinks he's propositioning her. He confronts Daniel, and may have gotten into a fight if Mira had not steered him away, telling him not to act aggressively in public. While walking away, Mira smiles apologetically at Daniel for Zack's behaviour. Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mira and Zack out for coffee. Zack punches Daniel in the face while bystanders took pictures and uploaded them online.\nChapter 4\nOn the first day of school, bullies are forcing Jiho to fan a magazine up and down because of the heat. When an unattractive girl tells them to stop because she was getting cold, the bullies laugh at her. However, when Mira asks them to stop, the bullies stop immediately.\nChapter 5\nWhen Zack goes to the convenience store where Daniel works at night, he is upset because he thinks Mira is attracted to Daniel in his new body. It was also revealed that Chapter 2 was Zack's date with Mira. Moreover, Zack had asked Mira out, but she had refused. Zack was so mad that he beat Daniel in his original body up.\nChapter 6\nWhen Zack's friends show off the picture of Daniel and compliment Zack's speed, Zack tells them that he isn't proud of hitting Daniel even though he actually wants them to speak up louder so Mira would hear. He thinks that Mira would think he is cool for being very strong. Instead, Mira says that he hates the way Zack fights all the time. She explains that in Chapter 2 Zack had invited her to the movies only to get into a fight (with Daniel). The girl chatting with Mira tells her that Zack used to be a rising boxer in middle school.\nWhen Zack's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jae Yeol, Zack's friends, Mira, and Ha Neul look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.\nGhost Lady\nMira had forgotten her cell phone, and Zack was accompanying her to school to retrieve it when they bumped into Vasco and Bum Jae, scaring Mira. When Zack asks what's so scary about coming to school, Mira tells him of the story of the Ghost Lady, who prowls through the school on rainy days in search of her lost children. It turns out that Vasco was there to find the Ghost Lady because he wanted her to grant him a wish that people wouldn't call him stupid anymore.\nZack, trying to look cool in front of Mira, makes fun of Vasco's superstition, only for Bum Jae to dare him to sign his name on the glass frame surrounding the portrait. Mira, Bum Jae and Vasco waits for him in the classroom. When he returns, he tries to look brave in front of Mira. The next morning, Mira, Daniel, Vasco and Jace go to check out the signature only to find it on the window instead of on the portrait. Zack faints and wets his pants. In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.\nZack's Babysitting Diaries\nZack dresses up to meet Mira. When Mira greets him, she is holding a kid and Zack is horrified because he thinks that the kid is Mira's. Mira smacks him and tells Zack that the kid wasn't hers, and she just found the kid alone. She said the kid must've gotten lost. She and Zack take the kid to the police.\nThe police station is closed for an emergency dispatch. Mira tells Zack they have to split up so that Mira can take the subway to get to the police while Zack should wait at the cafe in case the kid's parents show up. Zack ends up taking the kid instead, growing attached to her. He names the kid \"Zami\" as a ship name for Zack and Mira.\nZack lets the kid walk on her own and the kid walks out the train without Zack. Zack frantically looks for her at the next stop, but he can't find her and panics.\n[\n2\n]\nMira thankfully happens to find the girl on her way to Zack.\nThey walk through the city and it is about sunset. Zack leans over and brushes the hair out of Mira's eyes and Mira smiles at him. Two guys start exit a building, speaking curse words and smoking. Zack covers Mira's nose with his hands and tells her not to breathe in the smoke. He also tells her not to look at the trash on the ground, laugh too much, and attempts to protect her from the wind. Mira is exasperated by the treatment.\nZack and Mira eat before they enter the police station. They deliver the kid over to a cop and Mira sweatdrops over Zack's happiness when he hears the kid call him \"papa.\"\n[\n3\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 125\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 186\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 187"

We know his sense of loyalty to Sinu Han was not all false as he respected Sinu Han for his strength and acknowledged him as Big Deal's Big Boss, at the time of the Jake Kim Arc, and stood up to Goo, well was about to, until Sinu Hand had told him not to get involved, which Old Face respected and stood down.\nBased on the type of people that Old Face chooses, and from what we have seen of him as a character and how he rose to the position that he was in Big Deal, it is very clear that he prefers those with power, influence and money, e.g. Samuel Seo, which is just like himself. When Sinu Han had planned his final act and had told Old Face that he was going to give up his ideology and sell Big Deal to workers this hit home to Old Face due to the fact that, 1, Sinu giving up on the ideology meant money finally coming to him, which shows his greed and, 2, being sold to Workers meant that they would gain money and, he himself, would climb his way within Workers and gain power, which also comes with influence as well.\nIn summary Old Face is loyal/unloyal, greedy, and wants to gain power one way or another no matter what he has to do.",

He had a tattoo of a compass under his right eye, he also have tattoos on his abdomen, which consists in a Eastern Dragon accompained by a flower.\nIn his school days, he has short and neat hair, a grayish-blue shirt with a navy blue tie and a brown backpack.",
        "personality": "Olly was a reckless young man with a obsession for dangerous activities. His first appearance was leaping off a smash building and landing on\nJames'\ncar. Despite his craziness, Olly was a very intelligent character and impressed\nGun Park\nwith his business skills the first time they met.\nJin Jang\nalso decided to work with Olly because he was one of the smartest heads of the crews.\n[\n2\n]\nThis was further supported by the fact that Olly not only saw through Jin Jang's plans and predicted Jang's betrayal but allowed it to happen in order to get Jin Jang to create a distraction, allowing Olly to have alone time with\nEli Jang\n.\n[\n3\n]\nIn the flashback chapters, Olly was introduced as a shy but ambitious person. Upon knowing more about Eli, he praised him and wanted to be like him, going to extreme lengths to get his attention. Many fans compare him to\nJiho Park\n, as both characters sought acknowledgement and validation from their peers, but got the wrong idea of being superior. However, while Jiho was often spiteful of\nDaniel\n's friendship and used Daniel and\nZack\nas a means to a higher status, Olly desperately wanted to be a part of Eli's friend group but was repeatedly rejected by Eli because he was not an orphan like the rest of them.\nIn the end, Olly desperately wanted to be accepted by Eli Jang and Hostel, because he considered them family. In\nEpisode 239\n, he remarked that the \u201cO\u201d in Hostel should represent Olly himself not\nWarren\n. It is later revealed, despite everything, he always considered Hostel his family above anything else and worked in his own way to protect them, such as covering Hostel B's payments to Gun and making Gun promise not to hurt Eli.\nHis reckless behavior and choices can be attributed to the fact that he cannot feel pain or emotions. This inability to feel anything also contributed to his obsession with Eli Jang because he believes that Eli was the only one who has made him feel anything previously (this is later revealed to be false, and his guilt over his involvement in\nHeather's\ndeath is really what caused the feelings). He often made exaggerated facial expressions because he was forced to act in order to mimic emotions. Due to this, he had to practice his facial expressions.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Not much is known about Olly's current fighting skills. He used to be weak when he was friends with Eli Jang, however he later underwent training by Gun, as head of one the four crews.\nWhile we don't know the components of his training, we do know that Olly felt no pain and fear towards anyone. This gave him almost supernatural endurance and durability, to the point where he could even tank hits from Warren Chae, Eli Jang, and Gun with no issue. The training had also given him Aikido as one of his martial arts.\nIt was hinted by several characters that Olly may be one of the strongest fighters in the entire series. Jin Jang had noted that Olly Wang rarely fought others on his own, relying on the Uncles instead. He also did not put much work into his crew, instead using Hostel as a means to find Eli. Jin Jang even went so far as to say if Olly had made any serious moves he would have been the one to \"dissolve the four crews into one\".\n[\n4\n]\nAdditionally,\nGoo Kim\nand Gun have noted in one of their conversations that it was ridiculous for Olly to seek out Eli if he wanted to feel fear because Olly was stronger than Eli.\n[\n5\n]\nQuotes\nTrivia\nOlly Wang was one of the few Chinese characters in Lookism, alongside\nJustin Peng\nand\nChuck Kwak\n.\nOlly Wang had some form of congenital analgesia allowing him to feel no pain which allowed him to grow very strong in a short amount of time under Gun's training.\nGun offered him training in a fighting style that was perfectly suited to his body and skills but he turned him down in order to become a copy of Eli and his fighting skills.\n[\n4\n]\nJin Jang had speculated that if Olly Wang had put in as much effort into Hostel A as the other Crew Heads did, he would have been the one to unite all four crews under his control.\n[\n4\n]\nOlly Wang didn't fear Eli, just felt guilt for the reason of killing\nHeather\n.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 266\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 249\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 280\n\u2191\n4.0\n4.1\n4.2\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 279\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 282"

Embarrassed, he continues to fight him until\nCrystal\nknocks him out. She notices that the two Daniels were present at the same time and becomes suspicious of him.\nIn a restaurant\nJace\nis seated with the Hostel girl, and\nJohan\nis seated at a further table watching them. Jace is upset at the girl, but comforts her when she begins to cry. They are interrupted by\nSeth Lee\n, who comes to take the girl away. Jace is conflicted about whether to pursue her, because he is alone in this new town.\nJace buys Johan food and tries to convince him to help destroy the Cheongliang branch. Johan is not listening because he came to watch the news. He rejects Jace's offer because he resembles\nJin Jang\n, and leaves without paying the bill. Jace is about to give up on the girl when the cashier mentions the sad state of the girls who are used by\nHostel\n. Meanwhile, on the beach, Daniel and his friends are having fun and he is thankful for not having to fight.\nAt night Jace finally decides to pursue the girl, lamenting that he is a romantic. He has beaten some Hostel members and is cornered into an alleyway. They decide to attack him but they are beaten by Johan. Jace reveals that a while after they met at the restaurant Johan reconsidered and decided to help Jace. The terms of the agreement are written in a contract under the title \"One Night\", with the following conditions:\nJohan will help Jace for 12 hours\nJace will pay the bill Olly left for Johan.\nJace is the leader of this mission\nEpisode 259\nIn a flashback of that day, Jace and Johan are seated in a cafe coming up with the terms to the agreement. Jace is worried about Johan agreeing to fight for him because of he looks innocent and naive but soon he finds out that Johan is a vicious fighter, smashing people into the ground and stealing their shoes. He recalls that Johan never had a right-hand man compared to other gangs, and wonders what would happen to\nBurn Knuckles\nif Johan hadn't been betrayed by his gang.\nJace asks a Hostel member about where the girl is and is told she is at the tea house. He tells Johan and he decides to head over and beat everyone up. Jace protests that he needs a strategy, and when Johan refuses he reminds him that he is in charge. He comes up with a diversion plan: Johan will get information from inside Hostel and he will get the information externally. Johan is annoyed but agrees, and Jace is worried if impulsiveness will be a problem.\nOn the beach\nZack\nis frantically looking for\nMira\n. He finds her but she refuses to show him her swimwear, causing him distress. Hostel A hears about Jace taking heading to the tea house, and the girl realizes Jace is coming to save her. Seth tells them not to worry, because Brett is the head of the tea house.\nAt the tea house Jace is disguised as a guy from the Workers looking for a girl. Brett offers him some of the girls he has and physically abuses them, pulling one by their hair. Jace tells Brett to stop and he reveals that he knows he is a member of the Burn Knuckles, and surrounds Jace with his men.\nBrett becomes annoyed at the girl he is holding and tries to hit her with an ashtray, but the tray is kicked out of his hands by the other girl he sat next to, who is actually Johan in disguise. One of the men decides to sexually harass Johan, and Johan tells Jace he is done following the plan.\nEpisode 260\nJace tries to get Johan to calm down but the men snicker at him, causing him to snap and start attacking everyone. Jace gets the information from another Hostel member who tells him that the girl is actually at the gambling house. He is eager to tell Johan the news when he notices that Johan's hand was damaged from the fight. He remembers\nVasco\ntelling him a long time ago that he felt sorry for Johan because he was lonely. Jace offers Johan a bandage for his hands but Johan tosses it in the dirt, saying he doesn't need any help.\nAt\nJay's\nbeach house Zack is lighting a firecracker.\nZoe\ncomplains and he throws a tantrum about being able to do it on his own. The sparks singe the clothes of the Cheongliang fam, who angrily ask them what they are going to do about burning their clothes. Daniel worries that they are going to finally get into a fight. Back at Hostel headquarters Seth Lee hears that Brett lost.\nJustin Peng and Chuck Kwak\ntell him not to worry because Jace is with Vasco, and Vasco is not as strong as Seth. They decide to meet them at the gambling house.\nOn the way there, Jace asks Johan how he managed to get so strong during his fights, and if he has any friends. Johan lists his dogs' names and asks Jace the same question. Jace mentions the Burn Knuckles and talks at length about Vasco and how he misses him. Johan becomes jealous of his admiration for Vasco and proceeds to show off his strength by beating the gatekeepers of the building, claiming that he is better than Vasco. Jace disagrees and calls his behavior childish. They argue until Jace is punched by Seth Lee, who asks if Johan is Vasco.\nJace is surprised at how powerful the shot was. Johan offers to help him up and Jace hands him the bandage, thinking that he, Johan and Vasco could have been good friends. He is attacked again by Seth, leaving Johan shocked. When Seth continues to confuse Johan for Vasco he puts on the bandage and copies Vasco's stance, saying he will show Seth what Vasco is really like.\nEpisode 261\nJace is confused as to how Johan will fight like Vasco. Seth is unimpressed by Johan and challenges him to a thumb war. He is known in his region as a thumb crusher with tremendous strength, and Johan looks fragile enough to break. However, Johan is stronger than Seth thinks, so Seth decides to fight him. Johan endures his hits and knocks him out, saying the only reason he doesn't fight like Vasco is that he doesn't his style. Jace realizes how much stronger Johan has become, and Johan commands Seth's underlings to help Jace up.\nIn the gambling house, the uncles are warned that Jace is on his way. They are unconcerned, as they just defeated the entire gambling house. They say that they can take anyone on with their skills, even if it is Vasco. As Jace and Johan make their way, Jace tries to warn Johan of the skills of the uncles. Johan isn't paying attention, causing Jace to be worried.\nAs they enter the building the men are frozen in their places, out of fear of Johan. He realizes how much he underestimated the reputation that Johan has built during his\nGod Dog\nyears. He walks the girl out of the room and into the arms of Jace. He thanks Johan and asks him to help beat up the duo, but he refuses because his contract is over. Jace wonders what Johan's true motives were as he disappears again.\nThe next day is the day of the meeting between the CEOs of HNH and H groups. As\nthe CEO of HNH group\nmakes his way down the road, Johan waits for him in an alley. He knows the CEO has the means to cure his mother, and Johan has all the money. He waits until the man approaches and greets him nervously.\nThe night before, Daniel and the others have made peace with the Cheongliang fam and they are sitting at a bonfire together. Zack mentions that their shades remind him of\nVin\n, and the Cheongliang fam are suddenly alert. Elsewhere, Vin and\nMary\nare reminiscing about the Cheongliang fam. Mary is excited to meet them, but Vin has a bad feeling. It is proven to be correct when the Cheongliang fam attack Daniel's friends.\nEpisode 262\nThe Cheongliang fam demand to know where Vin is, and Daniel clarifies that they are not friends. MC Pesticides is relieved to hear of it and lets go of Daniel, but MC Rice Bag continues to harass Zack. While watching them quarrel, Daniel tells MC Pesticides that his friend is in danger because Zack is a skilled boxer. He is unconcerned because his friend is also skilled, flipping Zack on his head. Zack rushes MC Rice Bag and lifts him up in an effort to prove his strength. They are both lifted by MC Pesticides, who tells Zack he will punish him. Daniel tells them to stop and then flips all three of them, surprising Jay.\nMC Pesticides compares his strength to Mary, and wonders how Daniel can be so strong. Daniel is concerned that are outnumbered but then sees MC Pesticides running away, screaming about a monster. Then the remaining members of Cheongliang fam are flipped by Mary, the monster. She berates them for fighting, and when they ask if she came alone she reveals that she did not.\nThe next day, the two CEOs finally meet in Cheongliang. Jay's father compliments Crystal's father on how fast he is climbing up the ranks, and warns him not to get greedy. He implies that he suspects the other CEO is using children to collect money for him, and that he will expose him one day. Crystal's father realizes that the crew business is becoming dangerous for him, and is thinking of stopping it. He comes across Johan waiting for him in the alleyway.\nHe asks if Johan knows him and Johan stammers out his request. The CEO ignores him and turns to his men, telling them that this is the reason why the crew business was too messy and dangerous for him to continue. He tells\nGoo\nto take care of this mess and the latter kicks Johan's backpack, scattering his money all over the alley.\nGoo tells Johan he cannot be seen with the CEO, and that he is na\u00efve for trying to negotiate with him. Johan is enraged that Goo stepped on his money and orders him to pick him up. Goo is surprised that Johan would have the guts to challenge him, then notices that Johan's aura has changed and he looks deadlier than he used to.\nEpisode 263\nJohan does not hesitate to attack Goo, hitting him with all he's got. Goo gets up but is knocked down again and again by Johan as he showcases skills from Vasco,\nJake\nand\nGun\n. Goo realizes how dangerous Johan has become when he copies Gun's punch. On his final blow Johan is shocked to see that he has missed Goo, and Goo quickly recovers. He is surprised to see that Johan missed his last shot because he looked so determined. Goo mentions that he initially wanted to be friends with Johan, but decided against it because Johan is a \"momma's boy\". He ends the battle by beating Johan unconscious with a stick.\nElsewhere Jace gives the hostel girl his number, and she asks him out to eat. He then spots Vasco coming towards him with the bear family he made on the road to Cheongliang. Vasco gives him the sausage bars, and proudly tells Jace of his trials getting to Cheongliang. Jace fills him in on what happened last night and Vasco apologizes for not being there, but he disagrees with Jace that Johan helped him out for the money. Instead he thinks that the reason Johan helped Jace that night was so he would have a friend for the night. As he leaves Johan in the alleyway, Goo says Johan may have a shot at beating Gun in the future.\nMary reveals that her companions are the middle school judo club who coincidentally all look the same. The men angrily ask where Vin is and she tells them that he ran back to Seoul, because he was afraid they might kill him. She asks about MC Pesticides and is told that he ran away because he was scared of her. She is a bit upset because she wanted to see him.\nIn the daytime MC Pesticides passes his test to join Hostel A by lifting a motorcycle with the uncles on it. He tells them he will bring the rest of Cheongliang fam along, and asks about the other uncle,\nJames Gong\n. It turns out he is on vacation with Jasmine and the two of them stole\nOlly's\nbike. They are oblivious to the drama occurring within the Cheongliang branch.\nIn Korea's juvenile prison a rehablitation program is established by Hyunwoo Kim, a psychologist. He wants to prove that children can be changed for the better, but is disheartened when he sees the menacing looks of the inmates. He begins his evaluation with\nJiho Park\n, who is there for attempted murder.\nVasco's Mini Adventures\nThe title cards for the One Night Arc tell the story of Vasco from the time he missed the train to when he finally arrived. The cards begin in the Hostel Branch arc and events occur in this order:\nPart 1: Vasco is unconscious in the woods, and is found by a bear.\nPart 2: Vasco is fed by the mother bear, who takes him into her family\nPart 3: Vasco protects the bears from poachers\nPart 4: Vasco meets his master\nBrekdak\n, who is working as a poacher\nPart 5: Vasco trains in Muay Thai with his master and is spied upon by the bears\nPart 6: Vasco is gifted the \"golden mongkol\" and leaves with the bears to find Jace\nPart 7: He gives Jace the sausage bars, which are beyond rotten at this point\nNotes\nThe style of the title cards is very similar to the\nOne Piece\nmanga's drawings of Buggy's adventures\nThis arc may or may not be a reference to a one-night stand\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "name": "Summary",
        "synopsis": "Episode 320\nA rich Chinese girl gets high on LSD, and a cleanup crew covers her tracks to make sure she doesn't get caught in her hotel room.\nOutside, Brekdak gives his stand to Vasco to make money, and Vasco sells fish sticks to his costumers. He meets a variety of people, including \"Jane Kim,\" who is Jake in disguise. When the Chinese girl takes food, but doesn't pay the 500 won, Vasco realizes it and tries to go inside the club to get payment.\nJake, who entered the club, sees Old Face and decides to talk to him. Just then, Vasco, who is getting confronted for entering the club without the security guard's permission and is demanding payment, causes a stir and distracts everyone. This causes a fight to break out between him and some of the guards. Ho Hwang challenges Vasco to a fight.\nEpisode 321\nDJ Chaerin notices the fight breaking out with Vasco and Ho Hwang, but decide to just crank the music because the people are enjoying it. Old Face interrupts them and tells the guards he will handle the situation, and Jake is annoyed he missed his chance to talk to him. Jake suspects that Vasco doesn't stand a chance against Old Face, but Vasco has gotten stronger and easily knocks him out. Ho Hwang congratulates Vasco's strength.\nJake takes Old Face to a bathroom and ties him up. He sticks a toilet paper roll in his mouth and threatens to pump water down his throat if he doesn't reveal Sinu Han's location. Old Face tells him that he doesn't know where Sinu is, but he knows something else thats valuable. The girl in the stroller from earlier is Vivi, the president of the third affiliate and the daughter of a Chinese billionaire. She runs Hotel Vivi and Club Vivi. She is currently in the Workers because she is a drug addict, and drugs laws are more harsh in China. Old Face also tells Jake that her bodyguard is called Xiaolong, and his loyalty and the guards' loyalty is towarsd Vivi above all else. Xiaolong is rumored to be as strong as Gun, and the other bodyguards are as strong as the crew heads. Jake decides not to interfere with Vasco's fight, because he is not strong enough to lead a crew.\nVasco is currently losing against Ho Hwang when he tells him that he has learned a lot about winning from bad guys: he has to use his most lethal move first. He grabs Hwang's face and uses two of Brekdak's forbidden moves: No. 7 (Dough Kneading) and No. 8 (Rice Bag Smash). Jake approaches Xiaolong guarding a door and asks if he can speak with him in English, knowing that Xiaolong only speaks Chinese, and will probably only fight him.\nEpisode 322\nXiaolong responds to Jake in Korean asking if he would step inside, and he is dissapointed he didn't get a chance to fight. When he enters the room a chicken foot is thrown at the wall by Vivi, who is angry that Xiaolong sent an unattractive guard to her. Jake realizes that they mistook him for someone else and decides to play the role, introducing himself as a member of the White Tiger Company. He fakes details about Tom Lee's life and says he thought he would have met Sinu Han during his interview, saying that the two of them are lovers. Xiaolong mentions that he is No. 8, and Vivi tells Jake that their love was not meant to be given that the numbers are kept secret. Jake tries sneezing his name and playing a song about Sinu, but they are interrupted when Johan arrives and introduces himself as the intern from White Tiger Company.\nVasco continues to fight the guards, breaking one of their legs with Brekdak's Forbidden Move No. 6. Johan recognizes Jake, and he attempts to leave but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar. Brekdak enters the club wondering what is taking Vasco so long.\nEpisode 323\nBrekdak asks Alexander Hwang, who is now working as a valet at the third affiliate, to step aside. Other Workers members ask what is going on, and he explains that Brekdak is looking for someone. They tell Hwang they were going to report him for running a food truck without a liscence, and Brekdak backs off to save his business.\nJake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer and find more information about Sinu. Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen.\nThe two of them confront Vasco, and he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo. The three of them decide to fight each other.\nEpisode 324\nXiaolong reveals that he gave this test to Johan and Jake believing they would lose to Vasco. He does not trust the White Tiger Company, because the\nchairman of the Workers\nis using them to spy on the third affiliate, and he does not want any of his men in the club. Johan is fighting well using his taekwondo. Jake remembers a time he and\nJason Yoon\nate together, and Jason mentioning wanting to fight a powerful taekwondo fighter from Gangbuk, a guy whose moves resemble Johan's. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.\nJohan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them, disappearing into an underground passage.\nSteve Hong is impressed by Daniel's weight loss, and Sophia cries tears of joy now that Daniel has lost enough weight to go undercover.\nNotes\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "synopsis": "Episode 360\nThe girls working at James Lee crew's bar come to\nJiho\nto complain about the work. The bar manager bursts in and apologizes for their behavior, swearing he will teach them better. Jiho asks how many of the girls are complaining, and pulls out one tooth for each girl. They beg him to stop and say they will stop complaining about the work.\nDaniel\ncomes to\nJace\nto ask about the James Lee crew, and he tells them that he wanted to pay them back for messing with the\nBurn Knuckles\n. Jace says he didn't tell\nVasco\nbecause he is obsessed with beating bad guys, so Jace will do it instead. He tells the gang that\nAnsan\nis running a private bar in Gangbuk where only verified customers can enter, and they used underaged girls from the runaway fams to run these bars.\nDaniel goes undercover in Gangdong with\nEli\nand pretend to be runaway kids. It isn't long before they are approached by\nJacky.\nZack\nand Jace are pretending to be customers at a bar to get information on the illegal bar. Zack asks the girl next to him how old she is. When she says her age, Zack tells her to go get the head of the bar. Jace is excited that they will be getting more information, but Zack punches the manager and says they will take over Gangbuk like the other gangs. Jace hopes Daniel and Eli are doing better, but Eli has decided to pick a fight with Jacky.\nEpisode 361\nDaniel\nbreaks them up and apologizes for\nEli's\nshort temper, saying they get messed with a lot as runaways.\nJacky\ndecides to take Daniel for an interview, and Daniel tells Eli to stay behind and cool down a bit.\nZack\nbeats up all the gangsters to\nJace's\nsurprise. They interrogate one of the bar workers and he says they don't know about the James Lee crew, only that high schoolers have been taking over bars.\nChanning\nenters and is surprised they beat everyone, and he asks if they want to work with them. Zack punches him and discovers Channing is a kickboxer. Channing says he will only use one hand to fight, and Zack thinks he is going to use his feet when his guard is down. Channing however uses a tattoo gun to slash Zack across the chest. Zack loses to Channing, and Jace tries to attack him but he is knocked to the ground as well.\nJacky takes Daniel to the crew's base for an interview. He knocks on the door and gets no response. When he enters,\nDarius\nin yoga pants doing pilates. He crawls on the ground asking for Daniel to take off his clothes, and Daniel slams the door and apologizes internally to Jace for not being able to do the interview.\nEli decides to go to the base anyway, and\nDG\nrolls up to tell him not to. Eli refuses, and DG asks if he wants to get in trouble.\nEpisode 362\nEli\nsmashes\nDG's\nhelmet and tries to stab him with one of the shards. DG dodges and tells Eli he isn't looking for a fight. He whispers something to him and Eli wonders what to do.\nZack\nwakes up in despair that he could not protect anyone. He sees Vasco standing over him, holding the couple's tracker. He is staring at\nJace\n, who\nChanning\ntattoed\nAnsan's\nname on after stripping him to his boxers. Vasco cries tears of blood, and he remembers Jace saying extreme anger can lead to a person doing that.\nDarius\nsits\nDaniel\non his lap for the interview and makes him feel uncomfortable with his handsiness. Daniel stands up and asks where to see the boss instead, and Darius reveals he knows who Daniel is, and that his gang had prepared for them. Daniel punches Darius and rushes to the door, but\nHudson\nappears and punches him back. He asks if Hudson is from Ansan, and he admits it. Hudson's punches are powerful enough to create holes in the wall. Daniel thinks it is kyoukoshin karate, but Hudson says it is just training. With Daniel cornered, he starts whaling on him, preparing to use his right fist. Daniel hits Hudson back and steps on Darius's face to launch a kick, but Darius grabs his ankle and Hudson punches him in the stomach. Daniel is incapacitated, and Hudson leaves Darius to do what he wants to Daniel's body. He strips to his boxers and prepares to assault Daniel but Daniel gets up and punches him in the nuts.\nSamuel\nexplains elsewhere that the heated mode that arises during fighting is caused by inferior emotions that escalate into madness.\nEpisode 363\nJiho\nasks\nHudson\nwhat took him so long, and he mentions having left\nDaniel\nto\nDarius\n. He also says\nthe King\nwill be approaching soon, his senior. A crew member bursts in to say Daniel is loose and attacking the second floor.\nJacky\nis leaving the girls' dorm when he runs into\nZack\n, looking for\nChanning\n. He tells Zack to not be a sorry loser and Zack decides to fight him, saying he never lost.\nWarren\nlearns from\nMax\nand\nDerrick\nthat the reason they lost is that they underestimated Jacky. He is incredibly fast and flexible, as well as powerful. Jacky tells Zack that despite being a lower rank than Channing, he is more powerful than he is.\nHe kicks Zack into a car and Zack wonders aloud how he could lose this easily to these gangsters when he was doing so well against\nMandeok\n. Jacky tells him he isn\u2019t talented, and he should try something other than fighting. Zack is triggered and grabs Jacky, slamming him into a car. Jacky tries to escape but he is trapped within the metal folds Zack caused when he slammed him in there. Zack starts punching him in the face as Jacky begs for mercy before he passes out. Zack is satisfied he lost against someone stronger than Channing.\nVasco\ncomes to the location that was tattooed on\nJace\u2019s\nbody. Channing asks him if he is scared of needles, and Vasco tells him to not bother him since he is going to die soon.\nEpisode 364\nAs\nDaniel\nis fighting\nHudson\n, Hudson recalls his call with\nhis senior\n. He told the guy that\nJames Lee\nmay arrive in Seoul to squash the people using his name. His senior tells him not to use that name in vain, and Hudson says he is not joking. Daniel continues to slash Hudson in real time, and he says that the King of Ansan is coming, and he can\u2019t let him see this mess. He rips off his shirt.\nChanning\nremembers when he used to bully people in school, tormenting his victims out of boredom. He tells\nVasco\nhe wants to be remembered forever as well, and slashes him with his tattoo gun. He mocks Vasco for playing crew with the\nBurn Knuckles\n, who are scrubs. Vasco says that he knows this, and it doesn\u2019t matter because he will fight on their behalf. He said the same thing to the Burn Knuckles before, and\nJake\nacknowledges this side of Vasco to\nLineman.\nHe punches Channing in the face, breaking the ground underneath him. Channing is stunned by the blow, and pulls out some more needles but Vasco keeps beating him. He wails that he was recognized by\nGun\nand\nGoo\nthree years ago, and Vasco uses\nBrekdak\u2019s\nfifth forbidden move, and then a compressed low kick (his third forbidden move). Channing\u2019s legs are crippled and Vasco tries to turn himself in, but the cop refuses.\nEthan\ncarries\nDarius\nout of the building so he and the other\nBackdoor\nmembers can guard the entrance of the hideout.\nDG\narrives and asks who is using his name. Darius orders Backdoor to capture DG, and he decides fists will work better than words.\nEpisode 365\nDarius is asked what his dream guy would be like, and he says a strong man. When asked about DG he says it isn't possible to feel lust for a god. DG complains that he isn't as strong as he used to be, and leaves after beating up everyone.\nDaniel and Hudson are exchanging blows. Hudson grabs his left arm to punch Daniel but he kicks him away. Hudson has a flashback to his master at a bonfire. The king of Ansan says that he will be giving the crew to Hudson, who will be the sun of Ansan. He offers him a roasted python and Hudson accepts his position. Hudson tries to motivate himself against Daniel but he is struggling because Daniel is copying his moves. Daniel kicks Hudson out of a window and slams his face into the ground as they fall. He tells Hudson to return as friends in the future.\nDaniel then sees a guy walking towards him. He asks if he is the King of Ansan. DG is also walking in that direction when he notices something.\nEpisode 366\nThe guy ignores Daniel and walks to Hudson, saying he did well and it's okay he lost. He ignores Daniel a second time and says he isn't interested in the second generation, but he came for James Lee. Daniel asks if the guy is willing to lose again, and he gets irritated.\nTom Lee narrates that there were many powerful leaders of the first generation, one of them being Taesoo Ma, king of Ansan who Daniel is currently fighting. Taesoo has the trademark of only fighting with his right fist. He is very powerful, damaging Daniel's arm and stopping his reverse kick.\nTaesoo recalls his past when he fought with James Lee and lost. James acknowledged Taesoo but said it was time for the first generation of fighters to end. Since Taesoo would never stop fighting, he decided to cut his finger off. Taesoo pleaded with him to take his right eye instead. Since then, Taesoo has wanted revenge against DG, and to do the same to him.\nDaniel gets back up and says he will show Taesoo how powerful the second generation can be. Vasco uses Brekdak's skill No.5 on Taesoo, and Zack punches him with chains in his hands. Taesoo is pleased with them all and tells them to come at him. Then DG comes flying from the building to kick Taesoo. He tells Daniel to go inside since there is someone waiting for him.\nEpisode 367\nDaniel, Zack and Vasco enter the building looking for Jiho. They find a Backdoor member who says Jiho is waiting for Daniel at the place, and he wants Daniel to come as himself and not James Lee. Zack is confused and wants to come with Daniel, but Daniel says he must go alone. He goes home and dresses in his uniform in his original body.\nDG is fighting Taesoo, who doesn't recognize him. Hudson wakes up and is surprised with how quiet and calculating DG is during battle. Hudson starts crying seeing his idol lose, and Taesoo remembers his loss to DG. DG leans over Taesoo and says even though he lost, he is still cool. Taesoo recognizes DG and breaks down, flinging at him wildly with both fists. Hudson and DG are shocked to see Taesoo break his own rule of only using his right fist.\nEpisode 368\nEver since Taesoo lost to DG, he has been training his left fist for revenge. Even though he abandoned his principle, it didn't matter if he could kill DG. Now his fist reaches DG. Hudson is shocked to see James Lee threatened by Taesoo and dodging his powerful punches. DG however tells Taesoo that he's gotten weaker, and he kicks him to the ground. Taesoo recalls DG telling him after their first fight that the reason he was so powerful was the faith he had in himself. By giving up on his values, Taesoo is weaker in DG's perspective.\nHudson sees his idol crumbling before him and starts crying. DG tells Taesoo not to bother him, and he says that it doesn't matter. The first generation know that James Lee exists, and they will come after him for their own reasons. DG says it wouldn't be a problem since the second generation isn't made of pushovers.\nDaniel confronts Jiho at the convenience store and asks him if he still pretends to smoke. Jiho asks how Daniel knew the location, and he says this was the first place the two of them fought. He then tells Daniel that he asked him to come like this because he has two bodies.\nEpisode 369\nDarius visited Jiho in prison before he left and reported what he found out about Daniel. He couldn't find any information about his family except that they lived abroad. His friend just slept the entire day. Looking into his school files he found that the fat Daniel was on the school record. Jiho asks Darius if he has ever seen the two of them together.\nBack at the convenience store Jiho reassures Daniel he hasn't told anyone the truth about his identity. He asks Daniel to give him the secret of the two bodies, but Daniel refuses and tells him to turn himself in. Jiho smashes Daniel into the window and says that he should understand the most how he feels. He slams his head into the ground and tries to choke Daniel with a string but he escapes. Jiho sticks a wine opener in his chest and twists it before slashing Daniel. Jiho stands over Daniel and says they are the same person, but Daniel just got lucky.\nDaniel has a flashback to a meeting with Duke. His fans came into the room and Daniel mistakenly greeted them before they asked Duke for a picture. In real time, Daniel punches Jiho into a convenience machine and tells him to stop blaming his appearance for his failures, because people can change. Jiho tells Daniel he can't change, and Wally stabs Daniel in the back but Daniel removes the knife and throws him away. Daniel then starts beating Jiho with systema. Jiho begs for Daniel to forgive him and give him another chance.

Daniel falls in love with Yui, causing\nZoe\nto feel jealous. She is even more upset when she sees Yui manipulating the class into thinking she is kind when she is not.\nAs Daniel becomes infatuated with Yui he wants to learn more about livestreaming. They visit Doo and discover he specializes in gross shock videos. Elsewhere, Yui finishes a streaming session and reveals she is hiding a boyfriend (Yong Lee) so fans don't kill her channel. She is happy a stalker stopped watching her channel and wonders when she can move on to Daniel.\nEpisode 29\nYui is frustrated that Zoe has begun livestreaming and has climbed above her. Duke is streaming when Daniel accidentally interrupts his session. Duke invites him in and is shocked to see his viewers rise. As the views become greater they notice two people competing to tip the most balloons. Lala Kim, the rich girl from the slave auction tries to outbid a stranger but cannot. The stranger was\nJay\n, who wanted to support Daniel the most.\nAt the convenience store Daniel spots Yui walk in with her boyfriend Yong.

He notices Yui and is surprised to see she has a boyfriend. Yong tells him to explain and Zack reveals Yui has been flirting with Daniel and giving him gifts. Yong proceeds to beat Yui and Zack chastises him. Yong challenges Zack to a fight.\nElsewhere, Zoe is happy to be receiving a lot of money from a sponsor called\n\"Gangnam Landlord\"\n. The sponsor is an older man who lives with his disabled father. He uses the disability check to pay Zoe for her thanks. He used to watch Yui's channel but he stopped after seeing she has a boyfriend. He is obsessed with Zoe and decides to make her his bride.\nEpisode 31\nYong tries to hit Zack but he is much faster. Zack tells Yui to keep quiet about the incident and beats up Yong.

He called Vasco but forgot to give him directions. Vasco found him anyway by running around the neighborhood searching for Haneul. He easily overwhelms the stalker and brings him to the ground.\nThe stalker's father comes out and tries to defend him from Vasco. The stalker whines about his father embarrassing him and Hyungseok is reminded of his behavior towards his mother. When the man complains he cannot overcome being at the bottom Vasco tells him that he overcame it, and Hyungseok wonders about Vasco's backstory.\nThe man is arrested and sent to prison.

        "synopsis": "Episode 46\nDaniel\ngoes to a department store to get his mother a gift for Thanksgiving. He is walking by his old neighborhood when he meets an old classmate who used to watch him get bullied. The classmate distracts him long enough to bring the other bystanders to Daniel's bullying.\nThey reveal that this kid became\nLogan's\nnew pet after Daniel disappeared. They take his money and his lucky charm from his mother. Daniel asks for it back and when they attack him he is surprised to find he is stronger than before. He stops fighting when he sees Logan Lee.\nEpisode 47\nDaniel is traumatized when he sees Logan and does everything he asks.\nOne of the girls\ngives Daniel his mother's gift and he is disappointed he didn't fight for the money. He decides to use his other body to get the money back.\nDaniel gets to the bus station and meets Jay, who is also going on a solo trip. Daniel is headed to Sunukdo, and\nJay\nis heading to Busan for a vacation. He changes his ticket and gets on the train with Daniel.\nEpisode 48\nJay visits Daniel's house and discovers that Daniel is poor. When he meets Daniel's original body he offers him gum and helps him fold boxes. Daniel tells him how important that lucky charm was to him. The next day, Jay is gone and there are many boxes outside of Daniel's mother's house.\nLogan Lee is giving money to the senior students at his high school. They beat him for not giving enough and he asks what the money is even for. He beats them up and takes their money, and the seniors are worried that the money collectors will be upset.\nJay asks his assistant to find information on Logan Lee. He confronts Logan in an alleyway.\nEpisode 49\nThe seniors call\nGun\nand tell him about Logan. He mentions that he isn't the money collector, but he will send\nGoo Kim\nto take care of the matter. He is currently in a meeting with\nCrystal\nand\nDG\n, who asks Gun if he can meet Daniel someday.\nLogan begins fighting Jay, who is very fast and skilled. He realizes Jay is using Systema, a martial art he is unfamiliar with. He threatens to rip Daniel's money and Jay rushes at him. Logan grabs him by the hair and pulls him into a guillotine choke. He tells Jay to tap out but he struggles and passes out. Daniel spots Logan choking Jay and leaps in the air to fight him.\nEpisode 50\nLogan tries to hit Daniel but he smacks his arm away. He runs towards Jay to pick him up and sees Logan towering over him. Daniel panics and is frozen in fear, but Logan decides to let them go because he is intimidated by them.\nJay wakes up a short while later when Daniel is carrying him. He explains that Logan is a local gangster and asks why Logan attacked Jay. Jay pulls out the lucky charm, and Daniel realizes Jay came with him to get it back. He cries out of shame, because he couldn't be brave even in his new body.\nDaniel tries to return the shirt to the store when he discovers it is stained. The people refuse to allow him until they see Jay. They give him a new shirt and Daniel wonders if Jay used to be an employee. When he returns to his neighborhood, he asks\nVasco\nto train him and decides to change. Back at the old neighborhood, Logan is back to bullying people.\nNotes\nPavlov's Dog is a famous experiment in psychology; it is also the title of this arc. The idea is that a creature can become conditioned to react to a stimulus. Daniel's stimulus was Logan, and the reaction was fear.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

Another idol who rose to fame at the agency is\nAru\n, a country singer who transitioned into a pop star following her debut.\nDaniel\nand\nDuke\nwere recruited into PTJ in their freshman year but Daniel has dropped out of the program following the Aru scandal. During his time there, DG was promoted to the CEO as well.\n[\n1\n]\nOrganization\nClasses\nPTJ Entertainment has a strong heirarchy with a strong emphasis on ability. Trainees are separated into 3 classes: A, B and C.\nBoys from Class A\nDaniel's class, Class C, was only just created when he arrived.\n[\n2\n]\nClass A seems to be composed of more talented and senior trainees while C is composed of greener and less talented trainees.\n[\n3\n]\nClass C is the only co-ed class, whereas Classes A and B are separated into female and male groups.\n[\n3\n]\nPTJ Trainee Rules\nTrainee rules\nThe training program seems to be incredibly harsh. A list of rules for trainees is seen stuck to a pane of glass.\n[\n2\n]\nTranslated, it says:\nImpolite, uncivilized people will be fired\nThere can be no incapable people here. Those who slack off will be fired\nThose who smoke or drink alcohol will be laid off\nThose who are late more than 3 times will be laid off\nThose who have romantic affairs will be laid off\nThose who do not show improvement at the end of month evaluation will be laid off\nExpenses for trainees\nFood expenses\nOne of the reasons why Daniel decided to become a trainee is because of the fact that the company gives an allowance for food expenses. A class is given 6000 won for meals whereas C class is only given 4000 won for meals. This is one of the ways the company discriminates based on trainee ability and tries to encourage hard work within the trainee community.\n[\n3\n]\nMembers\nCEO\nDG\nManagers\nHyeok Ahn\nPTJ Dept Head\nPTJ Marketing Head\nTrainees\nDuke Pyeon\nOliver Jang\nLasol\nEunda\nSook\nFormer Members\nCharles Choi\nAru Lee\nAru's manager\nDaniel Park\nYongmin Jang",

They both audition and Duke does well, but is rejected anyway for his appearance. Daniel says he will not go unless Duke does, and Duke is accepted into PTJ.\nThey begin at Class C, the lowest rank. Daniel and Duke are greeted by\nOliver\nand\nLasol\n, two other Class C trainees. They greet another trainee who enters, and Daniel recognizes her.\nEpisode 97\nThe trainee is\nJoy Hong\n, who he modeled with previously. Joy joined PTJ out of fun, and to see Daniel as well. The trainees go out to eat at a restaurant and Daniel finds out they are all on a budget. When the Class A kids leave their food, Daniel tries to take some and they make fun of him for it. Joy pays for everyone's food and tells them off. As he is heading home, Oliver spies a picture of the singer\nAru Lee\nand sings to himself.\nDaniel is heading to the agency when he meets the Class A boys and a new guy, who beckon him over.\nEpisode 98\nThe man is\nAru's manager\n, who tells Daniel not to get cocky.

He usually wears a black suit with an orange tie and a white coat with the sleeve that has the Japanese kanji (\u5929\u4e0a\u5929\u4e0b/\u3066\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3066\u3093\u3000\u3052) which means \u201cthroughout heaven and earth). Nomen's jacket is an item he has held from his past as Kagiroi's leader with the rest of his outfit being the standard Workers uniform.\nNomen's outfit whilst operating as the Kagiroi was seen to be all white with loafers, dress pants, and a button-up shirt with a red trim.",
        "personality": "Nomen's core characteristic is his extreme drive. This drive has manifested in both his conquering of the Kanto region of Japan whilst operating as nothing more than a biker gang whilst he was contending with the Yakuza. This drive has also manifested lustfully as his extreme attraction towards Neko or Mitsuki despite her open and extreme adoration towards Sinu Han.\nIn either case, he displays a relaxed aura both towards his gang and whilst flirting and openly soliciting sex with Neko. This results in him being viewed as highly charismatic and intimidating by his gang and other fighters but as nothing more than obnoxious by Neko. The above leads to Nomen openly antagonising all people that make advances or seem to make advances on Neko.\nHowever, this bellies Nomen's own genuine love for Neko. Nomen's lustful actions manifesting partially out of his prior experience of simply and easily obtaining women due to his position and charisma. Nomen is willing to lay down his own life for Neko not simply out of a mere desire for sex.\nNomen is also able to display genuine respect for others, seeing Sinu Han as a rival vying for Neko's attraction alongside himself.",

        "synopsis": "",
        "history": "Before Nomen was a member of Workers as Mitsuki's bodyguard, he was the leader of a biker gang in the Kanto region entitled \"Kagiroi\". Kagiroi's presence was such that they were mythologised as a boogeyman to scare children into being quiet. Kagiroi was strong enough to conquer the Yakuza in the Kanto region even leading to them being known by Gun.\nDespite this, Nomen suffered from one thing: erectile dysfunction. The cause of this was unknown to him, and caused him great distress, emasculating him and depriving him of multiple sexual encounters. However, his continual dismissal of women that wanted him appeared to his gang as him simply having a high standard for women.\nEventually, after Soma Mitsuki took over her father's business, she approached Kagiroi as a business partner and her first bodyguard. Nomen, upon seeing Mitsuki gained an erection for the first time in multiple years. Nomen immediately asked Mitsuki out to view the fireworks. Mitsuki was understandably disgusted by this, her disgust compounded by her pre-existing misandry. However, Mitsuki's disgust only increased Nomen's attraction for her leading him to vow that he would make her his woman.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Nomen is a powerful fighter with seemingly no martial arts background. However, his fighting ability is correlated to his motivation, seemingly compounded greatly if he is in a situation wherein he is threatened.\nNomen's fighting is completely ad-hoc with pure strength as its cornerstone with seemingly no grappling skills.\nRyuhei also has an insane level of weapon proficiency when wielding his Berserker a wooden sword wrapped in chains he was able to use this weapon to trade hits with\nGun Park\nQuotes\n\"I am the mad dog, Kagiroi!

        "appearance": "Samuel Seo is introduced appearing sophisticated and more mature than his actual age. He has fair skin, with a strong V-Shaped jawline and dark, narrow eyes. His figure is extremely muscular, with a more prominent, broader chest and arms than a majority of characters. His black hair is combed back neatly, and he wears slender, rectangular glasses. He is revealed to bear tattoos, consisting of Sak Yant and images of various objects. He is considered to be attractive by societal standards, as Amy notes.\n[\n2\n]\nHis standard work attire consists of a clean white suit with a blue tie, occasionally with a brown overcoat draped over his shoulders. He covers his exposed skin, such as his neck and hands, with makeup to cover his tattoos. Outside of work, he is also seen wearing other variations of fashionable matching suits. He isn't as cleaned up, with messy hair that sweeps over his face and rolled sleeves.\nSamuel is notable for his continual creation of bizarre and extreme facial expressions representing his current emotion and his numerous moments of fanservice where he is shown wearing little to no clothing.",
        "personality": "When dealing with the general public, he presents a fa\u00e7ade of being a well-mannered, charming, young man. He is noted by Daniel to be sarcastic,\n[\n3\n]\nalthough there have been no other confirmations of this. Beneath it is a man who is cold-hearted and ruthless. In regards to business matters, Samuel believes that the ends justify the means and will do whatever it takes to get ahead. He does this through various illegal and underhanded methods such as illegal streaming through forced labor contracts and obtaining monetary loans through false promises.\nDespite his arrogant and sadistic attitude, he is shown to have some insecurities that stem from his birth origins. He harbors an inferiority complex that causes him to fly into a rage when he feels he is not being respected or undermined. This is especially the case in situations where Jake is involved.",
        "history": "Samuel was born and raised in a poor environment, as his mother abused him and father was absent in his life. He was also bullied by kids in the neighborhood for not having a father. His last name was chosen randomly, and he did not know his father's last name.\n[\n4\n]\nAs a middle schooler he led the Gangseo Alliance, uniting the local gangs under his leadership. He was powerful enough to be scouted to join Big Deal, one of the Big 4 Crews.\nAt a young age he was always curious about who his father really is, but his mother never let him discover that himself. Because of this, when Samuel found a photo of his mother with the famous gangster Gapryong Kim, and assumed that the man was his father. This boosted Samuel's confidence, as he strived to improve himself in power in order to be recognized as Gapryong's son. However this belief was shattered when his true biological father returned home to his mother. Enraged at the revelation, it is implied that he killed the two of them but there have never been any confirmations of this.\nAt the height of the Gangseo Alliance, Samuel felt offended when he was not directly scouted by\nSinu Han\nto join Big Deal. Thus, he took the Alliance to confront\nJake Kim\n, who was scouted by Sinu himself. After joining Big Deal with Jake, Samuel met people such as a young\nOlly Wang\nand\nJohan Seong\n, and looked down on them. It was only then after Sinu was beaten by\nGun\nand\nGoo Kim\n, Big Deal falling under the mercy of Gun, and the revelation that Jake was Gapryong Kim's son, Samuel ended up straying away from Big Deal and it's original goal and ideals, which culminated in him fighting Jake one last time, and lost. Samuel left Big Deal after that, and quickly formed and dismantled his own crew, Gangseo Union, in Gangnam, to gain Gun's approval. Gun then proceeded to take down Samuel and denied him of his approval, judging that he was a ticking time bomb and wasn't enough of a leader like Jake.\nSamuel then fought between Jake, Olly, and Johan in a fight as the heads of the\nBig 4 Crew\n. He was the first to get taken down during the fight. After reflecting on all the fighters and how they have improved in power and status since they last met, Samuel was demoralized and broken. However, this awakened something in Samuel, as he soon developed a new, more brutal, fighting style. Following this, he immediately beat Jake, Johan, and Olly. While this happened, Goo showed up and was amazed by Samuel's performance that he told Samuel that he approved of him and made him his new secret best friend.\nSamuel later became the executive of the Fourth Affiliate of the Workers, and was complicit in an illegal streaming business until the downfall of One MCN.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Samuel's fighting style reflects its owner's own savagery fueled by inferiority. His style has been described by many as vicious and uncontrollable with liberal usage of weapons such as brass knuckles. Samuel prefers to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength with a tendency towards punches. Samuel's style is such that his defeated opponents are damaged beyond necessity.\nSamuel has been shown to make him able to be on par with Jake Kim and Daniel Park. In the past, he was able to defeat all crew heads after first awakening to his style. Samuel notes that his power peaks when his body feels like it's \"burning up.\" He described this \"burning up\" as \"madness caused by self-hatred.\"\n[\n5\n]\nZack Lee also experienced this phenomenon and became very strong. Samuel's trigger for this state seems to be excitement for a fight.\nIn the 1st Gen King arc it is stated by himself and\nSeokdu Wang\nthat he has reached and surpassed Mastery and Samuel was a big part in the battle against Seokdu as he could tank all the headbutts thrown at him by Seokdu while Warren and Eli was put out of commission with just one. Seokdu Wang even went on to say that Samuel Seo has achieved the Stage of Resilience even saying Samuel Seo has The Ultimate Resilience.\nIn Chapter 466, Samuel was drugged by Jinyoung Park to feel an overwhelming sense of inferiority, causing him to go insane, aiming to kill whoever came in the room he was hidden in. It was revealed that the drugs had caused Samuel to bring up his past, where he deep down believed that Gapryong Kim had been his father, but been disappointed in the end. Afterwards, he began to bring up the incident where he had defeated his own union (Gangseo Union) just to gain Gun's approval, but was rejected. The throwback of these incidents had made Samuel insanely strong, fueling his inferiority complex to the point where even a full force hit from Jake Kim left him unfazed.\nWhat makes his strength even more crazy is that Samuel Seo never had a teacher and learnt a distinct fighting style, his fighting style is barbaric and crude, flaunting off his sadistic nature.\nQuotes\nI\u2019ll help you find Sinu, but you need to help me too. I want to be king\n[\n6\n]\nTrivia\nSamuel hides this, but his biological father is an air conditioning technician, he hates him and prefers to believe that, deep down, his father is Gapryong Kim.\n[\nCitation needed\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nHe is a year older than Daniel, and the same age as Jake Kim.\n\u2191\nLookism, Episode 289\n\u2191\nLookism, Episode 288\n\u2191\nLookism, Episode 303\n\u2191\nLookism, Episode 362\n\u2191\nEpisode 346\nNavigation"

Soon Samuel did not understand the reason, and held a grudge against Gun Park.\nEli Jang\nEli and Samuel fought together against the first generation king of Suwon and defeated him.\nDaniel Park\nNew Body\nThey meet when Daniel stops him in front of the One MCN building and asks if he's part of Workers.\n[\n1\n]\nSamuel confirms it, they talk, and he leaves, annoyed.\n[\n2\n]\nLater on, after Daniel finds out that Like What and So Funny were being forced to stream due to an inhumane contract, Daniel feels resentfulness and anger towards Samuel for the binding of the contract.  Samuel overall seems to be displeased and suspicious towards Daniel.\nAfter Daniel and Warren deal with the 2 main security guards of One MCN, Daniel can be seen fighting with Samuel, even using one of Samuel's  brass knuckles in their fight. However, Samuel leaves half-way through, thanking Daniel for unknown reasons after talking with Tom Lee. Samuel seems to be nonchalant, while Daniel seems to be displeased and confused.\nSamuel was beaten along with Jake by Daniel in the third affiliate while Daniel's body was in the unconscious state.\nOld Body\nHe looks at Daniel's application, while Daniel is annoyed that he is acting so calmly, despite admitting that he was part of Workers. After looking at Daniel's application, Samuel says that he really wants Daniel in the company and hires him.\n[\n3\n]\nDaniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel, and gets into his office using the black badge that Gun gave him. He looks around and finds Samuel's brass knuckle, and a board with pictures of the 4 major crews, and weird markings plastered on them. As he hears Samuel get into his secret office, he hides with Alexander Hwang whose in disguise, under a desk. Samuel seems to be suspicious of Daniel disappearing, and Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel's relations towards the 4 crews as well.\nAlexander Hwang\nAlexander and Samuel are implied to have known each other before Samuel even joined Big Deal.  Alexander would follow and be loyal to Samuel throughout the years. However, implications of the motivation of staying imply that Alexander wanted to use Samuel.\nIn the early stages of their relationship, Alexander can be seen trying to make himself of a notable identity towards Samuel, yelling out his name at every possible occasion. Later on after Samuel gets rejected by Gun,  Alexander can be seen telling Samuel to \"move on\" from Gun throughout the years. In the end, fame and money gets to Alexander, and they develop a relationship where Alexander gets abusive and suspicious of Samuel, even once almost running over Samuel with a car.\nLater in the manhwa when Tom Lee is seen capturing Alexander, (which is later revealed that he took him to make him work for the third affiliate) Hwang calls out to Samuel asking him to save him. However, Samuel ignores Alexander and leaves telling him, \"It's not personal.\" This implies that Samuel does not care about Alexander.\nGoo Kim\nSamuel Seo is one of Goo's four \"secret friends\". Though initially seeking Gun's approval by defeating Olly, Jake and Johan\n[\n4\n]\n, Samuel earned the approval of Goo because of his strength and vicious fighting style.\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 287\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 288\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 288\n\u2191\nhttps://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/lookism/ep-316-jake-kim-15/viewer?title_no=1049&episode_no=316"

        "synopsis": "Daniel Park VS Gun\nAt the end of the episode, Samuel steps out of the car and walks past Eli into the MCN building. They exchange glances, but he doesn't stop.\n[\n1\n]\nWorkers (4 Affiliates)\nThe two girls featured in the last chapter whisper to each other. One mentions how attractive Samuel is, but the other says that Daniel was still more attractive. Samuel ignores their whispering, even going so far to tell them not to interrupt him. He agrees to hire them because he thinks that they had a 'baby sister' vibe and introduces them to the top five streamers on Kwitch, then leaves to do something else.\n[\n2\n]\nAnother day, when Daniel goes to One MCN for the first time, he recognizes Samuel and asks him if he's part of Workers.\n[\n3\n]\nSamuel grabs Daniel by the arm and confirms it with a smirk. He tells Daniel about the history of Workers, saying it was established to make a hundred billion dollars. He then asks with a fake smile if there was anything that Daniel was concerned about regarding it, and Daniel says no. Samuel leaves, looking miffed.\n[\n4\n]\nDaniel submits an application to the executive, Samuel, who tells Daniel that he wants him in the company because of the potential for success. He states that Daniel had an incredibly high number of streamers for his first streamcast, earned the nickname 'King Daniel' already, and was relatable to the viewers.\n[\n5\n]\n[missing information, please add]\nSamuel stares out the full length window from the top floor and reminds one of the employees to not touch any of the streamer's belongings, because it might leave a trail.\nIn the morning, he checks up on Daniel. He says that Daniel had been causing a disruption by ordering so much fried chicken, and tells Daniel that he would not be able to escape by asking the deliveryman even if he wanted to, because the food always went through people working for Workers before it went to the streamers. He then asks Daniel if he went into Samuel's personal room (Daniel did), and Daniel attempts to punch him instead of answering, but is stopped by Senior Manager Kim, the leader of the Fourth Affiliate's security team. Samuel states that he always hires people to do his work instead of doing it himself, so he would not fistfight Daniel. Samuel then turns around and leaves, telling security to teach Daniel a lesson.\nUpstairs, Samuel reports to Alexander, telling him that their revenue would succeed the Third Affiliate's that month, and reports on the newest streamers. Alexander tells him that he would make a good president. He then asks about how someone came to visit the company from the four major crews.\nSamuel says that it was Hostel, and mentions that he saw Eli Jang at the front of the building earlier. He laughs when he mentions Olly Wang's death to Alexander. Samuel also says he saw Daniel, and Alexander says that Gun had approved of him.\nAlexander angrily beats Samuel because it was not reported to him earlier. He tells Samuel that he did not want to get involved in the Four Major Crews if it was not necessary.Alexander says that Samuel was still not like his old self.\nWhen he leaves the room, Samuel reflects to the time he met Gun after he managed to beat up a large group of people. Lost in thought, he bumped shoulders with a man. The man handed him the box of fried chicken after exchanging brief words, then takes off his motorcycle helmet to reveal Daniel Park.\nSamuel comments that he did not usually deal with intruders, but cracks his neck in preparation.\n[\n6\n]\nReferences\nTemplate:Reflist\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 286\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 287\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 287\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 288\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 288\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 290",

        "synopsis": "Episode 34\nZack\nasked for a favor from Namsoo to look for a Limited Edition Jordans Shoes from the Craigslist. Having no idea on how much it costs, he only gave Namsoo $300. Namsoo had no choice but to find it despite the fact that it is almost impossible to get it with that price because he did not have the courage to tell Zack. Namsoo, who has almost given up, found a person who agreed to sell him the shoes for that price who, through the profile picture, appears to be a beautiful lady. The two agreed to meet the following day at Gian Station.\nThe next day at school, Namsoo informed Zack that he had found the shoes. Namsoo insisted on taking the shoes himself although Zack wanted to take it himself, saying that he is experienced enough to spot the product's authenticity (although this is actually because he wanted to meet the girl).\nRight after Namsoo met the girl, he was startled with the presence of another two men who threatened to beat him up if he failed to pretend that they all are friends. He then realized that the girl was part of the scamming scene because she looked calm despite the situation. They all went to a quite, dead end, alley, and met the girl's boyfriend who presumably is the leader of the gang. Haeri (the girl) revealed that Namsoo had been chatting with her boyfriend Woojin, a thief from\nGian High\n. Woojin took all the money and almost left when Namsoo suddenly stopped him and begged for mercy, stating that it is not his money, but his friend's who is a boxer. Feeling insulted by thinking it was a threat, Woojin beat Namsoo up.\nEpisode 35\nThe next day, he nervously informed about the whole incident to Zack. Much to his surprise, Zack didn't scold him nor hit him, but in fact felt guilty for not taking the shoes himself.\nYui\nthen came and joined the conversation. Yui suggested the idea for Zack to try ordering from them again, this time with his own phone, telling them that although it's a fake phone, they will most probably will still be using it for a while due to the high cost. She also told Zack to change his profile picture into someone else who looked like a pushover, and they all decided on using\nJiho's\npicture. Zack decided he would go and confront the thieves alone, but was surprised when\nDaniel\nvolunteered after prodding from Zack's lackeys. The five of them begin to leave. Yui grabs Namsoo and says they should go as well;\nMira\n, obviously worried for Zack, makes the excuse to go looking for books in that area.\nJay\nalso follows secretly on his motorcycle.\nEpisode 36\nWhile on the way there, Zack, his lackeys, and Daniel all run into\nVasco\nand\nJace\n. After explaining the situation, Vasco joins them, telling Jace not to come with. He and Zack's lackeys stay behind. Meanwhile, they are being followed by a troublesome trio, Yui, Namsoo and Mira. They all decide to rest at a cafe, and Zack makes a threatening face to some other guys (the lackeys to the thief who beat up Namsoo). Vasco ignores it, and Daniel is uncomfortable.\nZack notices the trio following and goes to greet them. The thug lackeys followed, and threaten Zack, telling him to follow them after noticing the pretty Yui and Mira. Namsoo then sees Woojin coming. Woojin surprises Zack with a punch to the face, then punches him a couple more times before he knows what's going on, much to Yui, Mira and Namsoo's horror.\nMira yells at Woojin and they walk away. Mira wants to report it, but Zack tells her not to. Next, Woojin and his two henchmen (a judo guy and a kicking guy) wait for the meeting with a supposed weakling. Zack, Vasco and Daniel appear; Zack is still bleeding from earlier.\nEpisode 37\nZack takes out the two henchmen temporarily, and uses the very technique that Daniel used on him to hurt Woojin, but Zack gets beaten by fatigue. A bunch of sophomores (more lackeys from Woojin's school) show up, and Vasco steps in. Soon enough his gang (\nthe Burn Knuckles\n, BNC) shows up.\nEpisode 38\nThey join the fight. Vasco waits patiently, and is jumped from behind by one of the three henchmen, the judo guy, who grabs Vasco's shoulders. Vasco easily raises his arms, breaking free effortlessly. Vasco uses his famous vice grip (shoulder grab) to bring him down. Everyone who's felt it sympathizes with the pain.\nMeanwhile, Jay smokes next to his motorcycle. Apparently, Woojin called more backup (freshmen), and Jay took them all down by himself. A new face (with another guy) appears, complimenting Jay's fighting skill, saying they don't like the kids from Gian High. He tells Jay that he should stop smoking or he won't get a lover, then he and the other guy leave. Jay drops his cigarette and decides to quit smoking.\nBack to the main events, we have Woojin feeling caged. He charges Daniel, since he mistakes Daniel's nervousness as weakness, and realizes that both Vasco and Zack just calmly watch. He wonders why, trying to punch Daniel, but of course our cinnamon roll dodges like a boss. Because of the girls behind him, Daniel knows he can't do anything but fight, so he jabs (quick punch) at Woojin. Woojin jumps back before it hits him. Daniel decides to retry a straight (Zack's signature punch, which Zack showed little Daniel before), and steps forward, hooking (swinging from the side) him in the stomach, then going for the straight, right in the face. The fight is over. Vasco tells Woojin to cherish his girlfriend. Haeri cries over Woojin, holding his hand, and Vasco cries out of jealousy. Vasco insists that the BNC walk home because they don't have helmets.\nGun\nwas watching the whole time, recognizing Daniel's improvement. The beaten Woojin, leaning on Haeri, and the big judo guy approach and notice Gun (they were in the same high school). They chitchat, and Gun's apparently the same age as them (has to take the qualifying exam for university).\nBack at school, Zack says Daniel must be a boxer and he lied, and wants a rematch in an official ring. Namsoo notices that Zack got his shoes in the end and envies it, knowing he couldn't have bought them for the amount of money he had. That's when Yui asks Zack if he'll study for mid-term exams (he won't), which makes Daniel realize he didn't study at all.\nNotes\nIt is implied Jay might have feelings for Daniel in this arc\nMany of the characters in this arc are seen in Taejun Park's other comic about smoking\n(The Real Anti-Smoking Campaign)\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

His footwear seems to be somewhat heavy-duty, and he wears a black jacket tied around his waist and occasionally wears\nCheonliang Fam\njacket over his shoulders.\nPhysically, he is shown to be quite muscular and handsome in a rugged way, with shaggy black hair that almost reaches his shoulders and solid black irises with prominent eye bags.\nHe has polydactyly, with six digits on both his hands and feet. Though he lost his extra appendages on both his hands and feet due to Shinmyung Cheon's cruelty in chapter 492, they have since been reattached.",
        "personality": "Seongji is shown to be quite rough in his demeanor, calling Vin Jin a funny bastard and threatening to kill him when called a monster during their first meeting.\nDespite this, he is a very dedicated man, choosing to fight the Kojima Brothers as well as three members of Generation 0 in order for the Cheonliang Fam to have a chance to escape. When they were caught, he would choose to take any punishment from the Shaman in Vin Jin's place.\nAs a result of serving as the offering, he has severe PTSD, choosing to live in the mountains to avoid the eyes of the village's people. This PTSD can even trigger a special kind of seizure that causes him to destroy everything and everyone around him, though he won't remember anything.",
        "history": "Early in his life, likely around the age of late elementary school, he was abandoned in Cheonliang by his family, leaving him for dead on its shores. It was there he would be found by Mujin Jin, who had recently plundered the treasure of the Shaman, including the Red Paper. However, Mujin wasn't able to read Japanese, so Seongji claimed he could before feigning amnesia to get Mujin to stay with him, the man agreeing to do so until Seongji remembered. Mujin taught Seongji how to be self-sufficient and raised him for a time, helping him to trust other people again. Mujin would then disappear without a trace, leaving behind Cheonliang's treasure for Seongji.\nAfterwards, he became a sacrifice for the Shaman's scams due to his polydactyl features and was trained to become a yaksha (a type of \"bodyguard\") for\nShaman\n's child, a\nCheon Taejin\n, which he never became. He eventually escaped, but upon realizing that he'd be similarly rejected by the outside world, believed that he wouldn't be able to leave and fell into his first seizure, afterward seeking refuge by hiding in the mountains. Since Shinmyeong had no further need of Seongji, planning to make Vin the new sacrifice, he would scheme against the young man by spreading rumors of a monster living in Cheonliang to the circles outside. After a lengthy amount of time spent getting into unwanted fights, he would meet Jichang Kwak.\nOne day, the children that would go on to be the\nCheonliang Fam\ncame across him, though Seongji met them with open arms and hospitality, teaching them about the truth of Cheonliang, with Vin and Sujin Kim joining the family later on.\nAfter Vin discovered the truth of his mother's death, he stormed the shaman's complex alone, causing Seongji to come to his aid while setting his shack alight to call in the other 1st Generation Kings. He would be able to defeat the two Yakshas easily, and would come face to face with\nJames Lee\n, awakening to three thresholds in the process and defeating the One Man Circle. However, since his fam would be captured, he allowed himself to be brutalized, even having his extra appendages severed, before the 1st Generation Kings intervened.\nIn the wake of that event, Seongji tried to distance himself from the fam to prevent them from being targeted by his enemies, as well as not to endanger them in his seizures.\nAfter being set up by Taejin Cheon to believe he was the murderer of\nSujin Kim\n, he committed suicide by walking into the ocean and tying a chain hooked to an anchor around his neck, resulting in him drowning.",
        "relationships": "Vin Jin\nHe and Vin Jin were quite close, as Seongji was his master and the head of the Cheonliang Fam. Vin deeply regrets not embracing Seongji during the set-up, and blames himself for the King's death.\nMujin Jin\nHe was Seongji Yuk's master, raising him after Seongji was abandoned by his parents.\nShigeaki\nand\nHiroaki Kojima\nThey taught him Kudo during his Yaksha training with them\nCheonliang Fam\nThey called him their master after escaping from the Shaman's scams.\n1st Generation\nDespite what some might think, Seongji was close enough to several members of Generation 1, namely\nTaesoo Ma\n,\nGongseob Ji\n,\nSeokdu Wang\n,\nJaegyeon Na\n, and\nJichang Kwak\n, for them to join forces to invade Cheonliang after Seongji sent them a message, likely asking for help, and even attacking\nJames\nand revenge for Seongji.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Due to the nature of Cheonliang's fighters, he was likely at the upper end of the 1st Generation. He has been shown to have immense grip strength, grabbing the ribs of two experienced fighters, three in each hand, and squeezing them to the point where they noticeably bend and crack. Later he was revealed to be the disciple of Ssireum legend,\nJin Mujin\n(Vin Jin's father and a man strong enough to rival the monsters of the 0 generation), he was also taught by the\nYamazaki brothers\nto be the Yaksha of\nCheon Taejin\nwhich he never became. His style mainly included\nJin Mujin's Ssireum,\na style where while fighting one can break opponents' bones with their grip strength and both\nGrapling and Striking Kudo\ntaught to him by the yakshas of the shaman. He was also proficient with\nJudo,\nwhich he taught to Mary Kim and the Cheonliang Fam.\nIn his fight with\nJames Lee\n, James states that\nSeongji has overcome two\nMasteries\n, of both toughness and power\n, putting them on a similar level. Despite lacking experience compared to James, he would be able to see his invisible attacks by believing in his eyes, allowing him to overcome\nthe\nMastery\nof speed\n, putting him a level above James, and allowing Seongji to be the first character in Lookism to defeat him, before James achieved the strength mastery.\nIn regards to sheer potential, Mujin Jin stated that Seongji was the one with the most potential in his life, and even James Lee attempts to scout him, stating that he'd be better than the two he currently had, likely referring to\nGoo Kim\nand\nGun Park\n.\nDue to having his extra appendages cut off by Shinmyung Cheon, his strength has been greatly lowered, likely reducing his fighting prowess permanently, but later his fingers were rejoined.\nQuotes\n\"I you haven't forgotten why they call me the\nKing of Cheonliang\n\"\n\"Also, you're not a Monster.

When she finds out he's being bullied, she charges at them despite being half their size and immediately transfers Daniel Park out of the school despite financial problems. She never considered Daniel as a burden to her. She is rarely seen scolding Daniel. She always tries to make good food for him and even saved up money for his glasses.\nWhen Daniel slowly became more responsible, she became very proud of him. She was really grateful for the gift he gave to her on Thanksgiving. She was also happy at her son's progress in academics and was glad he wasn't being bullied at J High.\nSecond Body\nWhile Daniel visited his mother in his other body, she treated him kindly and is very generous. She gave Daniel (currently in his other body) 5,000 won from picking up scraps and told him to take care of her son (Daniel in his normal body). She was grateful to new Daniel for not bullying her own son.\nDavid\n(Nephew)\nDylan\n(Nephew)\nSarah\n(niece)\nDaniel Friend's\nJay Hong\nShe is on good terms with Jae Yeol.

        "appearance": "Shingen was a tall and muscular middle-aged man with long black hair and white eyes with black clera. He had around his body from neck to toe tattoos who range from tiger-shaped patterns, one on his back and two on his broad shoulders and a bunch of cloud tattoos over his body. He wears nothing but a simple white tonga, but he casually wears a black hanfu tied by a dark gray rope under a dark gray kimono.",
        "personality": "Shingen's behavior by the time he had fathered Gun and his brothers is like that of a introvert, he is also cold to most of everyone he meets and sees, and it seems he doesn't even know the children that he has from all of his concubines, Gun is one of the many children of his.\nAs noted by his father and concubine, Shingen had once been an exceptionally vicious and blood thirsty man and was feared as a literal demon by both his syndicate and enemies. However, as implied, his defeat by\nGapryong Kim\nand his gang had caused a severe psychological blow to him. After his defeat, Shingen had become extremely lethargic and practically unresponsive to almost everyone and everything. So much so that he barely payed attention to \u201cconcubines\u201d, of which he barely payed conscious attention to and he himself had no idea that he even had children with them. This is shown where he hardly ever payed attention or noticed Gun\u2019s mother despite spending so much time together with her and despite her talking so much about their son and his accomplishments, Shingen had likely completely ignored her. Having no idea who Gun was when he came face to face with him and asked him who he was.\nDespite his generally lethergic and apathetic behavior, Shingen can come out of it should he find sufficient reason to. As shown when he had taken action to defend himself when the three vassal family heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate had tried to kill him. As shown, Shingen retains deep respect for his \u201copponent\u201d who is in Korea and he refused to die or be defeated by anyone elses hand.\nDuring his last fight against his twin brother, Shintaro, Shingen fully exhibited his emotions. As shown where he showcased the deep love, care and trust he had for his twin brother refusing to believe that he would betray him. Shingen himself admitted that if Shintaro has simply asked him for the position of the head of the Yamazaki, Shingen would give it to him no questions asked, with him expressing that he always believed that Shintaro was much more suited for the position.  Later, he would finally acknowledged Somi when she betrayed him and stabbed him, expressing interest in her when she began revealing her true emotions. When two of his sons came to his side to help him fend off Shintaro\u2019s forces, Shingen expressed surprise and developed a level of attachment to them immediatly, with him later expressing anger when Shintaro killed them. In the end, Shingen eventually acknowledged Gun and died protecting him.\nDuring his youth, Shingen also exhibited an outgoing personality and seemed generally positive as a person. It is likely that his circumstances were similar to Gun and the way he seemed \"vicious\" and \"bloodthirsty\" to others was most likely instilled into him by his father.",
        "relationships": "Gun Park\nShingen is seen to be cold to everyone, it is shown he doesn't really know who Gun is as the first interaction of him and Gun is strained and it seems that he could probably not know his other kids.\nDuring Shintaro's rebellion, Shingen started expressing interest in Gun, to the extent of even protecting him and losing an arm in the process. Before his death, Shingen apologises to Gun and saves Gun's life in one final act of sincerity in exchange for losing his life.\nShintaro Yamazaki\nShingen had a sibling and brotherly relationship with Shintaro, which was shown positively during their youth. Despite the internal turmoils and tragedy that would come in their adulthood, Shingen still loved his brother and believed that he wouldn't go as far as to deliberately start a rebellion on his own and that there was a misunderstanding, also admitting in tandem that he would've given him the position if he just asked. Shingen spent his last moments apologizing to Shintaro and understood why his anger came to be.\nSomi Park\nShingen initially showed signs of coldness towards Somi due to his lethargic state, but when the rebellion instigated by Shintaro came to be, Shingen admitted he was expressing interest in the latter and even spared her life despite being one of the traitors going against him.",
        "synopsis": "TBA",
        "fighting_prowess": "Shingen during the era of Gapryong's Fist.\nHe was one of the two people who were a threat to Gapryong Kim at the time. Due in part to his colossal size and muscularity, he fights ferociously and brutally, maiming many of the gang members who ambushed him effortlessly. He also possesses the \"Black Bone\" trait which supposedly makes him immune or somewhat invulnerable to blades and swords. Like all the generational heads of Yamazaki clan he also inherited Ultra Instinct State with a greater control over it, due to his ogre like build he has immense strength to fight all the vassals of Yamazaki clan who rebelled against him.\nEven in his lethargic state, Shingen was still powerful enough to gradually overwhelm Shintaro despite likely not having fought since his defeat at the hands of Gapryoung Kim. It was as such that Shintaro severely wounding him with the Yodo Muramasa and taking one of his arms away was due to Shingen deliberately letting him so, in an act to protect Gun, rather than Shingen not being able to intercept his attacks.\nCongenital Ultra Instinct\n\"Do you know why he fights alone when he wants to go all out? That's because while others adjust their Ultra Instincts to become stronger, Shingen adjusts his Ultra Instinct to suppress his strength, to avoid tearing his subordinates into pieces. The Trait of the Yamazaki is indiscriminate violence. The Child of the Reverse Eyes is the one born with that nature. The moment the child with the Reverse Eyes stops controlling his Ultra Instinct,\nthe Oni comes out.\"\n-\nGapryong Kim\n, CHAPTER 525\nBeing born with the Reverse Eyes congenitally, Shingen is also capable of entering a true-unconscious state where he relinquishes his control over his Ultra Instinct and starts fighting purely on his own instincts for battle. In this state, Shingen is incapable of distinguishing allies from foes, and is unconscious about his own strength.\nIn this state, not only was he capable of ripping bodies apart near effortlessly even with only one arm and fatal injuries all over his body, but was also vastly more powerful than Shintaro and even rendered the advantage of the Yodo Muramasa completely null.\nQuotes\n\"\nYamazaki Shintaro.\nI would've given you the position of the family head anytime if you just asked. But you dare break the moral laws of family traditions?\nAre you that desperate for this position?\n\" - Chapter 524\n\"Kid, Tell me. If there's something you want, I'll give it to you.\" - Chapter 525, to\nGun Park\n\"This is my first, and last bit of sincerity to you.

During her time serving him, Shinmyung is implied to have sexually assaulted her several times, likely from lust, though reasons related to vengeance may be possible. The shaman would ultimately strangle the woman to death in an act of rage.",
        "synopsis": "In chapter 495, he was cornered by the visiting first-generation kings before given a chance to escape by his believers. He managed to escape by climbing all the way up to the cliff only to get beaten by Vin Jin mercilessly, knocking nearly all of his teeth out before almost strangling him to death. Though Vin would ultimately relent so as to not kill him, Shinmyung tried to retaliate by lifting a huge rock above Vin's head to bludgeon him to death.

        "appearance": "Shintaro  Yamazaki is seen as a tall lean like man but is muscular, he has fairish skin like Shingen, he has a jet black colored slick back hair style similar to Gun's, he has broad shoulders, he is very handsome, has features like Shingen. He has Tiger tattoos too, except it doesn't cover his chest and torso part but at his sides and arms and down to the legs.\nHe is usually seen using a white Kimono and a white Haori with a black crest of the Yamazaki symbol, he also uses light grey Hakama pants, white tabi socks, and white geta clogs and he is usually see with a black fan that he is either holding or tucking it in his Hakama pant's waist area.",
        "personality": "Shintaro himself is noted to be exceptionally intelligent and capable, to the point that many in the Yamazaki Syndicate believe that he should be its leader.  However, Shintaro is a staunch believer in the Yamazaki Syndicate\u2019s rules and traditions to a fanatical degree. As shown, Shintaro is extremely devoted to his twin brother Shingen. Having viciously refused the offer of the three Branch Family Heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate to become the new head of the clan due to his brother\u2019s lethargy and proceeded to brutally execute them for betraying the syndicates traditions.  While he acknowledges that his brother\u2019s lethargy is determental to the orginization as a whole and him taking over the syndicate would beneifit and restore the syndicate to its former glory, Shintaro never the less continues to insist to follow the syndicate\u2019s rules despite the degredation and weakening of the group as a whole.\nA serious man who places the Yamazaki Clan's rules above all else, even commanding a young Gun Park to kill his son for dissuading him from becoming the next Clan Head. As noted by the Branch Family Leader\u2019s who he executed, him ordering the death of his own child had a deeper psychological effect on Shintaro than he initially believes and he may feel subconscious remorse at having done so and this has lead him to become even more fanatical in following the Syndicate\u2019s traditions and rules. Later on knowing the truth about his birth, he gets completely broken down mentally and goes on to kill Shingen to become the family head\nAs shown, after the truth of his birth was revealed, Shintaro immediatly felt immense guilt, despair and sadness at the death of his only son Haruto. Shintaro truly treasured and loved Haruto and fully acknolwedged his competence and skill as a leader and knew that if the Gun had become the next head of the Yamazaki, Haruto\u2019s supporters would likely revolt. Hence, the need for Haruto to die to preserved the syndicate and the rules and traditions Shintaro held so high. with Shintaro being able to initially maintain his sanity due to believing it was for the greater good of the syndicate. But when the truth was revealed to him on how he was the true firstborn and the true heir of the syndicate, Shintaro immediatly realized that Haruto\u2019s death was in vain and that as his own first born son, Haruto was always meant to be the heir.\nThis guilt of throwing away his son\u2019s life for nothing completely distabalized Shintaro\u2019s psyche. With him choosing to become the head of the Yamazaki clan due to him clinging to the rules and traditions he held and put the utmost importance in since the day he was born in order to avoid the despair of how pointlessly he had thrown away the life of his only son. With Shintaro even admitting that he never wanted to be the head in the first place and that he had only done so due to the \u201crules\u201d demanding that he take the position. Upon successfully taking the position however, Shintaro admitted that this only brought him more despair and made him feel emptier as time went on. As shown from Gun\u2019s return to the syndicate years later, Shintaro had already become suicidal and had long since decided that he wanted to die while still within the \u201crules\u201d he followed and valued so much; by having Gun kill him and take his place as the new Yamazaki Head. In the end of his life, Shintaro was relieved to have finally escaped the rules of the Yamazaki he had lived under for so long and died content leaving everything to Gun.",
        "relationships": "Haruto Yamazaki\nIt is seen that Shintaro doesn't have that much mercy on Haruto, as he was the one that made Haruto kill himself, as it was because he managed to make Gun see the bright side of things and almost turn down the role of the Yamazaki heir. When he realises that Haruto's suicide was a vain cause on learning the secret of his birth he completely breaks down.\nShingen Yamazaki\nIt is shown that Shintaro is dedicated to Shingen and even turned down the role of being the Yamazaki leader, as he said he will never break that Yamazaki protocol of the fact the oldest child gets to be the heir but on realising the sceret of his birth he gets a psycophathic trigger to kill his brother to follow the rule of the eldest child becomes the clan head. He also stated that he would correct the wrongdoings of the former oyabun and will become the clan leader himself.",
        "synopsis": "During birth both Shintaro and Shingen where born as twins but due to the Midwife's scheme Shingen became the eldest son and by succesion order he became the President of Yamazaki Syndicate,which was by birth right the position of Shintaro, even as the vice president of the syndicate he worked hard for the syndicate and helped it to flourish,their birth secret was known by former Yamazaki president and their father,Yamazaki Shinji, but he made no correction to this mistake as everyone thought Shintaro had no\nreverse eyes\nwhich\nwas the distingushing  feature of the family head( not succesion by birth).\nAfter the rebellion of the vassal families of the syndicate, When Shintaro came to know the truth form the midwife and the former oyabun he conspired against Shingen with Park Somi and even stabbed Shingen by manipulating Park Somi,killed the former oyabun killed the nameless descendants of Shingen who were protecting him and revealed that he also had Ultra Instinct.",

He also had same raw strength as Shingen and easily twisted the necks of Shingen's nameless children and crushed their skulls easily. Though, like his younger sibling, he inherited UI since birth. He is also proficient with Akido which helped him to fight on par with Shingen, he is also proficient with blades and katanas.\nYears after Shingen's death and his rise to leadership of the Yamazaki Syndicate, Shintaro became immensely powerful, where even though he fought in a carefree and depressed manner, he was able to overpower Gun Park, who had been training in Korea for years. Therefore, it is impossible to determine his true strength, since, even while fighting Gun in his cogenital \"Oni\" Ultra Instinct state, he was merely reflecting on his entire life and decisions with remorse. Even more so, he forced his own death by forcing Gun's fist to pierce his stomach.\nQuotes\nTBA\nTrivia\nGallery\nShiro Oni\nEp. 524\n- Shintaro using UI\nEp. 524\n- Shintaro using UI (Close Up)\nEp. 525\nEp. 525\nEp. 527\nEp. 526\n- Shintaro using Yodo Muramasa\nBusan (Arc)\nEp. 529\n- members of the Yamazaki Syndicate 1\nEp. 529\n- members of the Yamazaki Syndicate 1\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nMinor Character Navigation\nAdults\nAru Lee\n\u2022\nBrekdak\n\u2022\nDaniel's mother\n\u2022\nDaniel's Manager\n\u2022\nJohan's mother\n\u2022\nLasol\n\u2022\nOliver Jang\nMinors\nWoojin\n\u2022\nDaehoon Shin\n\u2022\nSeonong Ham\n\u2022\nSoomi\n\u2022\nStalker Girl\n\u2022\nTikTacTok Girl\n\u2022\nWally Lee\n\u2022\nYenna Jang\n\u2022\nYeonhui\n\u2022\nYong Lee\nAnimals\nEnu\n\u2022\nEden\n\u2022\nMiro\n\u2022\nRyan the Cat"

        "personality": "Sophia comes off as a stoic, expressionless woman with a no-nonsense, all-serious attitude. She shows clear intolerance for certain phrases, such as \"brought in\" or \"broke in.\" Beneath her seemingly emotionless exterior, however, lies a passionate, dedicated, and dutiful person, driven by a strong sense of honor and responsibility. She also has a mildly comical dense streak, as shown when she misinterpreted her employer's words due to a language barrier.\nRelationship\nAlexander Alyssa\n- It's mentioned that she's related to Sophia by blood, so she might be her daughter. However, given the sense of distance and the fact that they\u2019re seeing each other after a long time, it\u2019s more likely that they\u2019re relatives rather than immediate family.\nAlexander Valentina\n- She is related by blood, but upon hearing of the atrocities she committed, she became furious and declared that she would personally punish her.",
        "synopsis": "Sophia Alexander accompanied Steve Hong to\nDaniel Park\n's home. She knocked him out, and stood by Steve as he negotiated for Daniel Park to work for him. Once Daniel agreed to help fight against the Workers, she trained him to lose weight.\nShe is also responsible for\nJay\n's training in Systema and Kali/Arnis.",

As the one who taught\nJay Hong\nSystema and given her special forces background, her weapons skills are also top-notch. In a sparring scene with\nDaniel Park\n, she fought using a knife, making it likely that she was the one who taught Jae the Filipino martial art of Kali/Arnis.\nShe once knocked out the sturdy, durable Daniel with a single knee strike. Even Daniel\u2014who had greatly grown after fighting against\nGun Park\n,\nSenior Manager Kim\n, and\nTom Lee\n\u2014was so overwhelmed by her power that he lost all will to fight and could only watch as his body was dragged away in fear.\nAlthough she\u2019s not heavily featured in the story, Daniel\u2019s flashbacks portray her as a cold and ruthless trainer. At one point, she attacked him with a knife using her thick arms\u2014treating the training as if it were a live combat situation. This reflects the mindset of someone with a special forces background, where a single moment of carelessness can mean life or death.\nThe Systema used by Daniel is revealed to be the Alexander Systema, developed by Sophia herself. Considering that only a few characters in the Park Taejun Universe have created their own unique martial arts, Sophia's presence stands out all the more.\nQuotes\nTBA\nTrivia\nDaniel Park\ncalls her by the nickname \u201cSophie\u201d, implying that they grew emotionally close through harsh training.

They are missing a girl runner when Zack appears, having been in special training, and is intent on proving to\nMira\nthat he is better than Daniel.\nIn a men's soccer game between the Fashion and Practical Music departments, Zack scores a goal from close up. Fashion's costume is a honeybee while Practical Music is dressed as animals. As Daniel gets the ball, Zack thinks that Daniel cannot do any better than what he did, getting past ten guys. Then, Zack thinks of his experiences seeing his bullies kick a ball, and scores a long-distance shot.\nIn tug of war, Music vs Vocal and Dance, Practical Music prevails. The next is Fashion vs. Architecture, the latter dressed as riding dinosaurs, and\nVasco\nchallenges Daniel to a one-on-one tug of war contest.\nEpisode 92\nThe tug of war commences, and Zack causes a Fashion forefeit by purposefully tying Daniel's end of the rope to a basketball hoop, which Vasco pulls down anyway.\nVin\nkicks\nDuke\nto take out his frustration.\nIn Practical Music vs. Architecture's Break the Gourd, Practical Music wonders why none of the Architecture students are throwing. Then, they realize that they are just waiting for Vasco, who breaks the gourd in one shot. Zack also throws well in Fashion vs. Vocal and Dance, but Daniel also delivers the final blow. Again, Vin smacks Duke, callling him a roadblock. After Duke insists that he has done nothing wrong, he is beaten in a deserted alley. Vasco appears to help him, telling him that he is cool before taking off his shirt.\nEpisode 93\nVin's two sidekicks watch in horror as Vin mocks Vasco, calling him \"the fool from Construction Dept.\" However, as Vin tries a leg sweep on Vasco, the latter refuses to budge, and instead flips Zack with one hand, effectively removing his sunglasses. Duke asks Vasco if he can become strong as well, to which Vasco gives him his insane workout plan.\nThe last event is the relay race. Since the Beauty department has only one guy when there is need of two, Zack has volunteered to help, and he faces calls of traitor has he stands beside Daniel and Ho Jeong. As\nEli\nand Jay come racing, neck to neck, Daniel internally thanks Jay for the baton. Daniel and Zack race, and they are both running at the same speed.\nEpisode 94\nZack pulls ahead near the end of the race. Since Mira is watching, he is determined to win.\nYoung Mira shows young Zack her stuffed bear Brownie, calling it her best friend. Zack calls it childish, and asks what he is if the bear is her best friend. As Mira drops Brownie, Zack demands if this is how she treats her best friend when he realizes Mira is in pain. After running Mira to the hospital, it is revealed that Mira had burst her appendix, but she thanks Zack, saying that he was amazing.\nMeanwhile, in present day, Zack runs out of stamina. Daniel overtakes him by 0.04 seconds. In the talent show, Daniel and Duke perform again.\nZack is sitting on the steps, mourning his loss, when Mira and Daniel come to find him. He does not hear Daniel's explanation for being with Mira and instead assumes that it is because he is a loser. However, Mira drops her phone, which Daniel fails to catch. However, Zack is closer to the phone and is able to catch it. Mira says he has saved Brownie again, and Zack sees the bear keychain attached to her phone. Again, Zack is called amazing, and he is in renewed spirit as he heads to the party. At the party, he continues to catch anything that is dropped.\nEpisode 95\nIt's raining and dark out.\nMira\nand\nZack\nare sharing an umbrella as they walk to school. Mira had forgotten her cellphone at school, and Zack had agreed to accompany her to school.\nWhen at school, Mira suddenly sees two figures and screams. It turns out to be\nJace\nand\nVasco\n. Vasco clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. They great each other and ask if Zack's ok. Zack pretends he is, but he is actually frozen in fear.\nIt turns out that Vasco and Jace are there because of the story of the ghost lady. Apparently, at the end of the school corridor, there's a storage room that holds a portrait of the ghost lady. The story goes that the lady had married rich, but had been chased into the streets on a rainy day right after her children were born. Hence, she haunts the schoolyard when it rains, trying to find her children. If someone who isn't a child looks into her eyes, they will die unless they either cry like a baby or give her a doll. If they give her a doll, the ghost lady would be so glad that she would disappear and grant the person a wish.\nVasco says that he's come because he wanted to make a wish for people to stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Vasco's superstitious ideas, making fun of Vasco, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.\nWhen Zack arrives at the storage room, he realizes that the lights can't open. He then rushes over to a pane of glass, only to see the portrait of the ghost lady leering at him, bloodshot eyes wide. Zack hurriedly signs his name on the glass and skidaddles. As he runs back to the classroom, he cries like a baby just in case.\nAt the classroom, Jace is incredulous that Zack had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Vasco, but, Vasco, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.\nThe next morning, the school is abuzz with the news that Zack had signed his name on the portrait, and everyone flocks to the storage room to see if it is true.\nWhen they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane. Zack realizes that the portrait's lady's eyes are closed, and that he had actually seen the ghost the night before. He faints and wets his pants.\nIn the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.\nIn the epilogue,\nDaniel\nsays that he's felt as if someone was following for a while already. He wonders if he's ill. The ghost lady is seen following him, blushing. The chapter ends, saying that the ghost lady seems to have fallen in love.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "name": "Summary",
        "synopsis": "Episode 112\nVasco\nrealizes that, even though original\nDaniel\nhad persevered in exercising for 3 months already, he wasn't getting any thinner. So he's determined to find out why. That day, Vasco followed Daniel to the convenience store.\nWhen a customer began to berate Daniel for not heating up the food and was acting really confrontational, Vasco told him to heat it himself, and that store employees are still people. Daniel tries to get Vasco to stop because the customer is known for his bad temper, but, instead, the customer apologizes meekly.\nLater, when a middle-aged looking woman comes over to buy alcohol, Vasco asks for her identification. Angered, she asks how old they were to be ordering her around. Vasco replies he's 16. Daniel tries to explain that the lady has bought alcohol every day already, but, instead, the woman apologizes and calls Vasco \"oppa,\" showing that she was actually younger than them.\nWhen nobody was coming, Daniel began to exercise during the break. Vasco watches him, wondering why he wasn't losing any weight even though he was so diligent. Suddenly, Daniel sits down, saying he's very tired so he should replenish his energy. He starts wolfing down a hamburger. Vasco realizes the reason why Daniel can't lose any weight is because he's eating so much and orders that Daniel goes on a diet. Daniel can't stand it, and starts wondering why his other body wasn't getting fat even though they both eat the same amount. All of a sudden, he realizes the fifth truth: his other body's shape can't change.\nThe next day, at the cafeteria, Daniel heaps food onto his plate and wolfs it all down. Girls, seeing him, giggles and says he eats like a man. However, when Ji Ho tries to do the same thing, they call him uncivilized and dirty instead.\nHowever, at night, Daniel realizes that, no matter how much his new body eats, his original body is still very hungry. When he goes training with Vasco in the morning, he feels weak and hungry. He takes out a banana that he had saved from before, but Vasco snatches it away, saying that he shouldn't eat it. Daniel starts to cry, and, when Vasco takes a large bite of the banana, something breaks within Daniel because, whenever Daniel is very hungry, he would lose control. He rushes at Vasco, arms flailing. Vasco tries to tell him to calm down a little, but Daniel punches him hard, and Vasco is only barely able to block it.\nEpisode 113\nAfter\nDaniel\npunched him,\nVasco\n, frantic, gets into a fighting stance, trying to tell Daniel to calm down. As Daniel lunges to punch Vasco he hits Daniel in the neck, rendering him unconscious.\nDaniel wakes up in his new body, embarrassed that he had acted the way he did. He realizes that he had completely lost control and puts on his jacket to go and find Vasco and his unconscious other body. However, just as he tries to call Vasco, he sees his vision blurring again.\nIt turns out that Vasco, had woken him up by sticking the banana in his mouth. Apologizing and crying, he promises that Daniel can eat the banana. Daniel, realizing that his other body was now lying unconscious somewhere, tries to tell Vasco not to wake him up, only to feel himself losing consciousness again.\nDaniel wakes up in his new\nbody to see\na girl\nabove him, trying to wake him up. She asks if he's alright and apologizes, saying that she saw him suddenly faint. Daniel wonders if there had been someone there earlier, but thinks nothing of it. Thinking he must have scared her, he reassures her that he's fine and thanks her. The girl suddenly retreats, apologizing for touching him, and Daniel, thinking she must be very introverted, says she shouldn't apologize and if anything he should thank her for helping him.\nAt that moment, Vasco rushes over crying with original Daniel on his back. He explains that he called the emergency number 102 but nobody picked up. Daniel tells him it's 120, but secretly feels relieved that it was Vasco to find his body, because he couldn't remember the number to call the ambulance. Meanwhile, the girl thinks that Daniel has fallen in love with her and that, this time, her love wasn't one\nside. At the same time, she picks up the key to Daniel's room that Daniel had accidentally left behind.\nIn a flashback, the girl remembers her backstory. She used to have a crush on a boy called\nHeemin\n, but he rejected her because she was ugly. In school when she was older people would gossip about her, saying she's gloomy and that they're unlucky because they have to work in the same group with her for a project. Even now her neighbors would still gossip about her, going so far as to say that she should leave because she was bringing down the house prices. She would scratch at her arm, thinking that nobody loves her that she was very lonely.\nThe scene then cuts to PTJ's CEO\nDG\n.\nCrystal\nasks DG what he's plotting with her dad because her dad doesn't tell her anything. She congratulates him because he's looked happier after becoming the CEO, but he says that his good mood isn't because of his job but because his stalker finally stopped contacting him.\nDaniel is working in the convenience store while a storm is going on. He thinks to himself that it would be terrible if he had lost his key in this weather, so it's lucky that he found the key outside his front door. Meanwhile, his new body sleeps at home. As the thunder rolls, the girl he had met that morning crouches in front of him, grinning.\nEpisode 114\nDaniel wakes up the next morning to find that all the dishes in the sink were clean. He is confused because he doesn't remember cleaning the plates, but blames it all on the diet, saying that he's been rather forgetful lately. When he leaves to go to school, he sees the girl shivering outside his front door. She calls out Daniel's name and makes small talk with him. He wonders why she is sitting in the cold and realizes that she's eating something as well, but he doesn't comment on it.\nShe suddenly holds out her hand and asks if Daniel likes her ring, the same ring that she had shown her childhood crush. Daniel tells her it looks really pretty and asks if she's made it herself. Just when she's about to ask him another question,\nZoe\nshows up, offering to walk to school with him. The girl grows jealous of Zoe, who doesn't notice and hands her a hot pack. When they leave the girl remembers how Daniel had told her to go back home and believes Daniel would love her alone. She then takes out the key to his home, saying that she'll listen to him and return to their \"love nest.\"\nWhen she enters Daniel's home, she says \"I'm back,\" as if she were returning to her own home. She then smiles that hes's used her dishes, which she licks clean. The girl goes to fold the sheets, only to find original Daniel sleeping in them. She gets angry and grabs a kitchen knife to kill him.\nEpisode 115\nAt that moment Daniel arrives, coming home after a rough day. He looks around and sees that the room's suddenly become cleaner and wonders if he's hallucinating. He then notices the kitchen knife lying on the ground next to his mattress and the dishes are washed. As he takes a shower, he decides that his mother couldn't have come over and wonders if it is a manifestation of his dual bodies. Meanwhile, the stalker watches him take a shower.\nAs Daniel dries his hair, he walks over to his original body, slapping himself awake to get ready for work.Then, he uses his new body to continue drying his hair, saying that he doesn't want to go to work and deciding to eat before he goes. All this time, the stalker watches, wide-eyed, from behind the bathroom door.\nCrystal walks by Daniel's home to see the stalker taking out the trash. She says that there are only two boys living inside that house, and asks who she is. The stalker replies that she and Daniel are one and that they are family. She then asks if Crystal is his friend. Crystal replies \"ah, yes\" whist wondering if the stalker is his sister. The stalker girl, angered by this reply, asks if they are close, and Crystal is scared and answers no.\nMeanwhile, at Daniel's convenience store, Zoe is speculating whether or not the girl is stalking Daniel because she says she'd seen her before too, but hadn't paid much attention. She says that, now that she\nthinks about it, it seems kinda strange and wonders if the girl might have entered Daniel's home. At that moment, Crystal barges in worriedly, sweating from running. Crystal and Zoe both wonder who the other is, because they keep seeing each other around original Daniel. When he asks if she needs anything, Crystal replies that she's not there to buy anything but wants to know if he has a sister. He rushes home, scared, and looks around, only to find nobody there.\nThe next day, Daniel tapes pieces of tape to the door, and, when he rushes home, realizes that they hadn't been touched, showing nobody had opened the door during the day. He pushes the door open, and sees nothing has been touched and everything was just as messy as before. He rushes to the sink and is incredibly relieved to realize that the dishes hadn't been washed either.\nIn a moment of dramatic irony, the scene cuts to a cockroach, and then zooms out to show that it was crawling on the stalker girl's face as she lies in the space under the kitchen sink, grinning and saying that, as long as she's able to see Daniel, she would be happy. As she lies under the sink, she sees original Daniel slap his new body to get ready for school, and wonders why, whenever he switches bodies, one of them falls unconscious. She grins creepily as she realizes that it means that she should be able to take one of them.\nEpisode 116\nThe next morning, Daniel and Crystal see each other while jogging. Crystal asks him whether he comes exercising everyday after work. Daniel replies yes, and that he exercises with a friend (Vasco) every morning before going home. Crystal, finding something in common, exclaims that she also often exercises as well. Daniel looks at her suspiciously, wondering if she's bragging about staying in shape. At the same time Crystal thinks that original Daniel is kind, fond of small animals, determined, and hard working, and wonders why someone as good as him would live with someone like new Daniel.\nShe asks Daniel whether the stalker's been coming around anymore lately, and he replies that no, she hasn't, and thanks Crystal for helping, but asks how she knew which place was his. Crystal, not wanting to reveal that she's been investigating him under orders of her father, explains that she saw it when she came over to feed Enu. The stalker angrily wonders who she is and decides she must have her eyes on new Daniel and wants to steal him away.\nZoe comes over right afterwards, asking if he'd seen the stalker again and offering to walk to school with him. She then notices how the place where Daniel lives isn't really fancy so she asks what Daniel's parents do. He answers that his mother does a little of everything and Zoe mistakenly believes that his mother's in charge of a huge company that dabbles in a bit of everything and is incredibly impressed. Unbeknownst to them, the stalker watches them from within Daniel's room, and thinks that Zoe is there to seduce Daniel as well. She wonders when the permission form will be sent to her, and frantically check her cell phone only to smile when she realizes that it's just been approved.\nWhile at school, Daniel tells his classmates about his stalker. Zoe offers to walk with Daniel to school every morning, and says it'll be great if original Daniel comes along as well. Jay suddenly hands Daniel a utility knife and tells him to keep it. Daniel doesn't know why Jay is handing it to him but accepts. As he looks down at his hands he sees the ring the stalker had on, and realized that it must have been put onto him while he was asleep, showing that the girl was still in his home.\nFrantically, he runs back home and realizes that his original body had disappeared. He looks all over the place for a sign of the stalker. When he checks the space under the kitchen sink, he realizes that, although nobody was there, there were a lot of soiled adult diapers. The stalker girl appears behind him and tasers him.\nEpisode 117\nWhen Daniel wakes up, he finds that he isn't in pain and realizes that he's in his original body, but he can't move because he's been bound. The stalker is seen coming out of the bath, talking to an unconscious Daniel. She says that the two of them can live together forever, and that she's put the \"annoying pig\" in a place where nobody would ever find him.\nMeanwhile, original Daniel tries to scream under the tape on his mouth and flails in his bonds. He tries rolling around and falls onto the ground. Suddenly, he feels something sharp and starts to use it to cut at his bonds. When he is finally able to take off his blindfold and open his eyes, he finds himself in a room that is covered with his own photographs. He realizes he'd fallen out of the closet full of wine bottles, and the sharp object he had used to cut off the ropes was actually a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After wondering for a while what he should do, he decides to run to the police office.\nThe policeman, upon hearing his story, are surprised at hearing his story and commends him for running to report it immediately. When Daniel gives his address, the first policeman tells Daniel to wait a moment because the address Daniel had given was an hour away from the police station, which didn't fit with Daniel's story that he had directly ran to the police office after he saw the crime. The police then comments on how Daniel smells of alcohol, and decides he must be drunk. When Daniel replies he hadn't drank, the police admonish him for lying and begin interrogating him.\nSuddenly, Daniel loses consciousness as his other body wakes to find himself bound to a chair with his arms behind his back. They're in another room that's also covered with pictures of himself, and there's a circle of candles surrounding them. He asks her why she's doing this to him, to which she replies that they are one. She explains that this is their new home, and she'd specially decorated it for him, and that there were even some couple photos of them. She also explains that she's eating his fingernails and toenails as a snack, which she ate earlier when Daniel saw her outside his door.\nDaniel exclaims that she can't do this, that she'd also kidnapped his \"friend\" and that this was illegal. However, the stalker only turns around, grinning, saying that she knew his \"little secret\".\nEpisode 118\nThe stalker girl reveals that she knew about the fact that Daniel had two bodies, and that he changes by slapping himself. Daniel doesn't correct her, and decides to figure out where he is. When she refuses to tell him, he says that he won't marry her. The stalker is angry, thinking he's lying to her, and tasers him again.\nWhen Daniel wakes up in his original body, he's still in the police station, and the police still think he's lying. He asks Crystal for help. The police promise to help and are very reverent towards Crystal because it turns out she's very close to the department head. When Crystal asks how Daniel had contacted her without a cell phone, he explains he'd sent a message to original Crystal and asked her to pass the message on. Crystal offers to help find new Daniel, and Daniel thanks her and leaves, saying he's already found a lead.\nCrystal calls\nKouji\nand tells him to locate Daniel's cellphone. The Kouji tells her that he's not going to do it, but Crystal only tells him Daniel's phone number and hangs up. She looks incredibly angry and says that nobody should bully her Daniel.\nOriginal Daniel, on the other hand, heads to a telephone stand where he calls the number of the noodle restaurant where the stalker had called for takeaway. He'd memorized the phone number of the restaurant while tied up in his new body. He asks the restaurant to tell him the address of the woman who'd called for two bowls of noodles. However, when the restaurant owner hears his request, he seems to mistake Daniel for a stalker instead and hangs up.\nCrystal had already gotten the address from the Kouji through text. He tells her that it's a good thing Daniel's cell phone was still on, and tells her she shouldn't go alone and should bring Gun with her. She replies that Gun had went with Goo out of the country, and that it was an emergency, so she can deal with any danger by herself. The Kouji replies that it's true, she isn't pretty when she gets mad either, and tells her that it's free this time, but he wants her to think over his last request some more. As she gets closer to the address the Kouji's sent her, Crystal starts to get a little scared. However, when she arrives, she starts because she realizes she's been here before.\nEpisode 119\nThe stalker girl appears behind Crystal, and tasers her, believing she is there to seduce Daniel. She ties her up in a chair next to Daniel, saying that they should settle this dispute between themselves before \u201cher husband\u201d wakes up. Crystal then says that she knows the stalker, because she was also DG's stalker. The stalker asks if Crystal is talking about her ex-boyfriend, and says that she seems to have an interest in all of the stalker's past boyfriends. She continues to say that Crystal can have DG because she is already married now. The stalker's wearing a headdress, a white dress, and holding flowers, but Crystal realizes that the headdress is actually lace underwear and the stalker\u2019d made the wedding dress herself.\nCrystal asks her if she knows what she's doing. After all, she'd already kidnapped 3 people already. The stalker laughs and tells Crystal how she'd always been discriminated against because of her looks, but immediately starts talking about how a pig (original Daniel) would dare to sleep in her spot without even realizing how unfit he is. Crystal points out this discrepancy, telling the stalker that, even though she blames society's lookism, she herself is only attracted to handsome guys. Angered, the stalker lunges forward to taser her, only for original Daniel to walk in through the door.\nIn a flashback, original Daniel had continued to call the noodle restaurant, telling the owner that he was trying to help a friend who was in danger. The owner, hearing that he was trying to help a friend, changes his mind about the matter extremely quickly and tells Daniel the address. To his surprise, it turned out to be his home.\nThe stalker asks how he changed bodies when she hadn't slapped him, and Crystal is surprised to hear this. Daniel wants to use his strength to defeat the stalker, but the stalker throws a candle at him, and, when he's dodging the candle she tasers him. He falls unconscious and wakes up in his new body. Meanwhile, Crystal starts crying for the stalker to stop hurting original Daniel while the stalker continues to electrocute his unconscious body. She calls the girl a stalker, and the stalker tries to taser her but Daniel takes the hit, telling her not to hurt Crystal. The stalker begins to hit Daniel repeatedly until he is covered with blood.\nShe then tells him he should apologize, because then she'll forgive him, but she doesn't know he is only buying time for Crystal to escape while handing her Jay's utility knife. However, even though Crystal's hand was on the door knob, she hesitates to leave him behind.\nEpisode 120\nThe stalker noticed Daniel looking in her direction and launches herself at her, taser out. The scene cuts to\nGun\nwho is on the phone with the\nKouji\n. He tells him that Crystal had left alone, and worried for her, had phoned Gun to ask when he was coming back from overseas. Gun says he's coming back soon, and that Goo was still having a lot of fun beating someone up. He continued to say that he isn't worried about\nher because he'd taught her some moves earlier.\nCrystal kicks the stalker's head,causing blood to come out of the stalker's mouth. She says that this is a lot less than Daniel had to suffer and locks the door, telling the stalker to prepare to have her ass handed to her. The stalker cries and tries to squeeze Crystal but she aims her elbow at the stalker's back, incapacitating her in one blow. As the stalker falls to the ground, Crystal uses the taser to electrocute her. Daniel, thanks her, and she asks him why he'd let her go earlier. When he replies that it's because she's a girl, she continues to say that the stalker's a girl too, and tells him to stop judging people based on their looks. She realizes this may be the first time they\u2019d seen each other for who they were inside.\nThe police had arrived and had put the stalker in handcuffs. As the stalker is led to the police car, she cries for her \"husband\", trying to explain that her \"husband\" had two bodies. Meanwhile, the people around her snicker, saying she's lost her mind. Daniel smiles, thinking that nobody would believe the stalker's words, but, behind him, Crystal, wide-eyed, seems to realize the truth.\nEpilogue\nThe stalker girl asks two guys if they like her ring, and they answer that it's really pretty, if she made it herself, and that she was very good with her hands. They ask her if she has an accessories shop and where it's open. It turns out that the stalker had become really pretty. While in prison, she met a girl who had kept some makeup from the guards, realized the stalker girl could become really pretty, and taught her to apply makeup. When the stalker girl leaves prison, she uses the new technique to look beautiful, and she suddenly realizes that everyone's asking her for contact information and even offering her jobs. The story ends with the girl from prison telling her the moral that who you are inside doesn't matter because, in this world, everyone only cares about appearances.\nCookie\nIn the cookie we see a teacher in the staff room talking to someone about how close they were to becoming a Sophomore & finishing their first year, it's then revealed that the student the teacher was talking to was in fact\nLogan Lee\n, who wants to transfer due to a fight.\nNotes\nWhen the police are speaking to Crystal they use the term \"\u5343\u91d1\" in Chinese, which refers to a girl close enough to be your daughter.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "appearance": "Taesoo Ma is a muscular, tall, hulking man. He has black, messy, medium-length hair that is held back by a black headband. He has a rugged face paired with facial hair, he has a missing right eye and a scar in that area. His missing eye is a result of his fight with James Lee years ago and is now replaced with a removable fake eye.",
        "personality": "Taesoo Ma was a man with a strong belief, believing that using his right hand was manly and admirable. This belief slowly faded away after his fight with James Lee. He then started to train and use his left hand in hopes of beating James Lee/DG, discarding the belief of using his right hand.\nDespite his appearance, he can be quite caring as shown with his interactions and relationship with Hudson Ahn. He also prides himself as a member of the 1st Generation, boastfully stating that the 2nd Generation was not comparable to the 1st Generation.\nHe likes to be out in the wilderness so much that he\nbought an entire mountain\njust to hunt on it.",
        "relationships": "Ansan Public\nTaesoo Ma seems to have a teacher-alumni relationship with the leader of the\nAnsan Public\n,\nHudson Ahn\n. Taesoo Ma had seemed to be pestered by Hudson to teach him how to become as strong as him as Taesoo was considered the \"King of Ansan\" when Hudson was younger. Hudson seems to have met him around the age of 16, Hudson learned from Taesoo that he uses his right arm in fighting and only uses the left when needed. It seems Taesoo left Ansan in Hudson's care and Hudson thinks very highly of his \"Master\" Taesoo Ma.\n1st Generation\nNa Chaegyeon\nTaesoo and Chaegyeon have been shown to have an extremely bitter relationship, with Chaegyeon attempting to hit Taesoo with his car upon seeing him.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Taesoo's unorthodox fighting style comes from his philosophy, to be a \"man\". He fought with only his right fist, which is so strong that James Lee and Daniel Park were unable to parry, and gave Daniel the fear of his arms breaking off. It was also able to cause Beolgoo Lee  to bald. After his defeat by the hands of James Lee, Taesoo trained his whole body, including his left hand, abandoning his principles, this caused him to deteriorate and be humiliated yet again at the feet of James Lee in the One Night arc.\nAfter Taesoo realised he had betrayed his principles and lead as a bad example to Hudson, he got his act back together and retrained himself, developing the Ultimate Fist.\nUltimate Fist\nAfter training his whole body, Taesoo uses every single muscle in his body to use one strike, one that encompasses both Strength and Speed Mastery, to deal devastating damage to his opponent. This is his trump card only to be used against the strongest of opponents, such as James Lee.\nQuotes\nGood. Come at me with sincerity. Then I\u2019ll be sincere too. Let\u2019s have fun like we had in the first generation!\n[\n1\n]\n-Taesoo\nChapter 366\nI abandoned my faith and chose anger. It didn\u2019t matter. If I could beat you\u2026\n[\n2\n]\nThere\u2019s one thing I still have left. That is my rage to kill you\n[\n2\n]\nYou\u2019re going to feel the same despair that I felt\n[\n2\n]\nBelieve in yourself. Strong faith. If you don\u2019t start off believing in yourself, you\u2019ll never beat anyone.\n[\n2\n]\nI do not fight to be the strongest, I do not fight to win. There is only one reason why I use my fist: It is because I am a Man\n.\nGallery\nOne Night III\nEp. 364\n- Hudson's senior, the King of Ansan\nEp. 365\n- Taesoo arrives\nEp. 366\n- Hudson defeated\nEp. 366\n- Taesoo glaring at Daniel\nEp. 366\n- Taesoo talking to Daniel\nEp. 366\n- Taesoo defeated\nEp. 366\n- Taesoo hit by Zack\nEp. 367\n- Taesoo smiling\nEp. 368\n- The right-handed wonder Taesoo Ma\nEp. 368\n- Taesoo fighting James\nEp. 368\n- Taesoo vs DG\nEp. 368\n- Taesoo vs DG 2\nEp. 368\n- Taesoo being beaten by James\nEp. 368\n- Taesoo annoyed by Hudson\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)\nEp. 388\n- Taesoo sitting on car\nEp. 388\n- Taesoo's flashback 2\nEp. 388\n- Taesoo's flashback\nThe Kidnapping of Daniel Park\nEp. 397\n- Zack's flashback\nFirst Generation King\nEp. 406\n- Taesoo grilling\nEp. 406\n- Seokdu & Taesoo\nEp. 406\n- Taesoo eating\nEp. 408\n- Taesoo eating at a restaurant 1\nEp. 408\n- Taesoo eating at a restaurant 2\nEp. 408\n- Taesoo's flashback\nEp. 409\n- Taesoo talking about Mastery\nHolidays 2\nEp. 436\n- Taesoo cutting a snake\nEp. 436\n- Taesoo in his younger days 1\nEp. 436\n- Taesoo in his younger days 2\nEp. 436\n- Taesoo handing over his clothes\nEp. 436\n- Hudson wins angaist Jibeom Kwak\nEp. 438\n- James talking about Taesoo & Gongseob\nEp. 439\n- Jichang talking about Taesoo & Seokdu\nEp. 441\n- Charles talking about the Kings\nFuneral\nEp. 442\n- Taesoo shows up for funeral\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 454\n- Beolgu talking about Taesoo's defeat\nEp. 454\n- Hudson stands upon his principles\nEp. 467\n- Daniel copy\nEp. 468\n- Daniel's alteernative body copies Daniel's copy of Taesoo move\nCheonliang (Arc)\nEp. 481\n- Jaegyeon angry at Taesoo\nEp. 481\n- Jaegyeon angry at Taesoo 2\n1\n2\nBusan\nEp. 531\nUnknown chapter/Arc\nTrivia\nAccording to the author's\nlivestream\n, Taesoo Ma isn't barbaric, but he only hunts and eats wild animals because he owns the entire mountain.\nConsidering from Taesoon Ma's burn mark, it appears that the face was burnt with fire to prevent bleeding.\nTaesoo Ma is only smoker that smokes a cigar.\nReferences\n\u2191\nEpisode 366\n\u2191\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\nEpisode 368"

        "synopsis": "Episode 174\nAs the policeman tries to identify\nDaniel\nhe escapes onto the stairs. Daniel tries to run off with his body but they transferred him elsewhere. Daniel finds his original body in a different room with a new identity: a guy named James Lee. He wonders who his body really is.\nThe detective tells\nJiho\nthat everything is okay, he believes Jiho was a victim. He spins a story that Jiho was bullied by\nJames\nand Daniel and they fell as an accident. Jiho runs with this story and is placed in handcuffs because a witness saw that Jiho pushed Daniel. They decide to try him with attempted murder.\nEpisode 175\nThe detective tells Jiho he better call a lawyer because he isn't allowed to interrogate minors. Jiho's parents plead that he is innocent but the detective points out fingerprint evidence that Jiho had. He places Jiho in a holding cell. The policeman warns Jiho that if his victims die he will be tried for murder.\nDaniel takes the bus to the home address listed on James' file. He wonders if James has a family, and why they didn't contact him. He rings the door and hears someone answer.\nEpisode 176\nJiho's parents confront Daniel and ask him if he came to the address to settle with James. Daniel asks if they care about the victims and they leave upset. He enters the house to find it empty and unused, but there is a school uniform. Daniel breaks into the school and finds a trophy room full of James' stuff. He also finds a family photograph.\nDaniel visits the area in the photograph and begins searching for clues. He comes to an abandoned house with a date for moving house. He finds that James Lee moved to his old house. As he stands outside he hears a voice telling him to enter. That voice is that of\nCharles Choi\n, Crystal's father.\nEpisode 177\nCharles is angry at Daniel for wasting his talented second body. He tells Daniel that James Lee doesn't exist, and he covered for Daniel to avoid police suspicion. Charles tells Daniel he will reveal his secret to him if he can surpass\nDG\n, because he fears DG will become to powerful for him to control in the future.\nJiho's lawyer tells Jiho that he can get him out of jail if he plays the victim. Jiho has to lie and state he was bullied by Daniel and James. Jiho fails his case and is sentenced to juvenile prison. As he is brought to the prison yard he notices a sign on the wall saying 'No bad deed goes unpunished'.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\n\u201c\nCharles is about to undertake some major endeavor, and to test my fighting abilities... he sent me two kids in middle school?\n\u201d\n\u2014 Tom Lee to Gun Park and Goo Kim\nTom Lee\nis a secondary character in\nLookism.\nHe also makes an appearance in the\nManager Kim Webtoon.\n[1]",
        "background": "A man who fights wildly, known as the \"King of the Streets\" in Seoul, the \"Ultimate (Beggar) King\" during the 0th Generation. According to Jinyoung Park, he was a beggar that picked up by Gapryong Kim. After being picked up by Gapryong, he recruited Tom to his Fist Gang and became one of his closest companions alongside Elite and Jinyoung. Around at that time, he also raised Eli Jang and taught him how to fight. Unknowing of his actual name, Eli calls Tom \"Mr. Carpenter\".\nSometime before or after Gapryong's death, he joined Charles Choi and helped him form the Big Four Crews, becoming one of Charles'\nTen Geniuses\n. He also raised two children, Gun and Goo. Sometime after that, he formed the White Tiger Job Centre, an employment agency that will do anything for the right price.",
        "appearance": "Tom is a big middle aged muscular man with a square face, small eyes and long unkempt hair. He is often seen with a very wide smile. He always wears white gloves on his left hand, which hides the truth that he was an amputee due to unknown reason. He prefers fighting only in his boxers to avoid getting his expensive clothes dirty and is usually seen undressing himself right before fighting seriously. \nIn the past, he is seen wearing a bum hat and beggar-like clothes.",
        "personality": "Tom is a carefree, playful and easygoing person. He is a man motivated by and for money, evident when Charles Choi paid him to withdraw all his employees from the Workers, but then sent them again because the President of the Workers paid him more. Despite that, however, he seems to remain cautious and not careless about money. This is evident when he hunts down the child he once raised, Eli Jang. He once taught Eli that he should not take money carelessly because the money he received could have other intentions from the person who gave it.\nTom also has a strange interest, sometimes asking to see other people's \"birds\" or \"danglers\". He also dislikes being underestimated or being ordered by someone that he sees as being below him, such as Eugene testing him, which he was immediately infuriated by.\nTom also appears to be a caring and understanding person. This is shown when he hunts down Hostel, where he says that families shouldn't be separated and knows they will risk their lives for the sake of the family. Even so, he remains a professional, still doing his job well.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Tom Lee has no direct fighting style, choosing to fight wildly and crudely with his physical capabilities and figure, similarly to Eli Jang and Samuel Seo.\nTom is shown to be very fast for his hulking figure, as he was able to surprise\nJohan Seong\nwith his speed.\n[\n2\n]\nHis overall durability and endurance are on a whole different level compared to the other characters as he was able to take strikes from the likes of\nWarren Chae\n[\n3\n]\nand Johan Seong\n[\n2\n]\nwith ease showing little to no harm done to him. Tom also possesses immense physical strength being able to lift the back of a car with one hand\n[\n4\n]\nand hit Johan once and send him flying into a wall\n[\n2\n]\nHis many years of fighting experience were shown when he tricked Warren into thinking he was going for a headbutt to unpredictably bite one of his eyes instead. He can be quite ruthless in a fight, stomping out\nDaniel Park\nrelentlessly until he was completely knocked out. He fought with the Vice president of Workers,\nMandeok Bang\n, who held his own against Tom with the help of\nYuseong\n.\nAnother display of his inhuman strength is when he broke a wall by just flicking his fingers into it.\n[2]\nIt is stated by Manager Kim in his own series that he couldn't think of a way to beat Tom. Also it is considered and assumed that in the entire Pre Generation the only ones above him that could beat him is/was (when they were all in their prime) Gapryong Kim, Elite and Jinyoung Park.\nTrivia\nMajority of the characters whom have seen Tom at more than 50% of his strength have died.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\nManager Kim Webtoon Episode 47\n\u2191\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 301: Vs Johan Seong (2)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 298: Workers(4 Affiliates) (12)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 297: Workers(4 Affiliates) (11)"

        "synopsis": "Episode 81\nIt is the weekend, and\nDaniel\nis heading to\nVasco's\nbirthday party with\nEnu\n. Due to his drinking problem, Daniel assures himself that Vasco will hold the party at a normal cafe or restaurant. He reveals that both bodies were invited, but he wanted to go as his original.\nCrystal\nis also jogging in her original body, saying that it has become a habit to run. However, she meets Enu, who bites her, and realizes that Daniel is also close by. They make small talk, and both of them lament being in their original bodies; Daniel thinking that he cannot talk to her because if his new body had no chance, his original does not have any either, and Crystal thinking that she cannot talk to him because all guys like pretty girls. They both head to the Han River, thinking that they \"don't want to split.\"\nVasco turns out to be partying in the park, in the wintertime, on a blanket. He is incredibly happy that Daniel made it, and the latter excuses his new body by saying that he is sick. Vasco asks if Crystal is Daniel's girlfriend, which he denies. Three\nBurn Knuckles\nare there, as well as\nZack\nand\nMira\nand\nTaejoon\n. They are all freezing, and Daniel tries to ask Vasco to go indoors, but Vasco is so happy that no one has the heart to say it.\nThe Burn Knuckles apparently had a party at a pork restaurant, and they had drawn lots to see who would go to the park party, because \"we didn't all need to die,\"\nJace\nexplains to Daniel. Zack tries to leave the fool's party, but Mira convinces him to stay. They sing Happy Birthday to Vasco, and everyone is relieved when the candles are blown out, as surely Vasco would move inside now; but Vasco pretends not to notice and blows anyway.\nDaniel gives Vasco pictures of Enu's pups, since he knows about Vasco's love of dogs. Vasco is touched. Jace, who searched for months, presents Vasco with a Special Edition Heroman figurine. Vasco is moved. Zack grabs a rock and writes \"GOOD LUCK\" on it, insisting that it was a treasure from his mother and it will grant good luck to its owner. Vasco is again moved, as the others note that Zack isn't even bothering to hide the magic marker. Taejoon creates a Pacebook account for Vasco and gathers 100,000 followers, which Vasco responds to with apathy.\nVasco wants to play a recreational mating game, in which \"three\" consists of the third Burn Knuckle, Jace, and Daniel, the last two wondering what would happen to Vasco and Crystal. Jace tries again to move the party indoors but fails. Vasco calls \"two\" and reaches for Mira, but Zack, in a burst of fury, clips his nose. Vasco, blood streaming from his face, insists that it was an accident, and they move on.\nDaniel is chosen to play Duck, Duck, Goose. The three Burn Knuckles try again to talk to Vasco, but when he thanks Jace for always being his friend, Jace is too moved to speak. Zack tries to leave again, but it stopped by Mira. Then, Zack thinks about making Vasco mad. He takes out the Heroman figurine, replaces it with his rock, and throws the present into the river, saying that \"Heroman went for a swim in the water.\" Vasco jumps in after the present.\nEpisode 82\nVasco yells that he will not come out of the river until he finds Jace's present. Jace calls out to him, but Zack stops him, saying that if there is a fight to come, Vasco should use up his strength before it.\nPolice have arrived ono the scene, and Vasco has knocked out the entire Rescue Team. The Police ask if there is a tranquilizer gun for catching bears, to which the answer is negative. Zack realizes that Vasco's stamina is limitless. A reporter hears Vasco repeating the words \"gift\" and \"precious\" and deduces that he has been heartbroken by a lover. At last, Zack jumps into the river with the figurine that he took out earlier and calls to Vasco.\nVasco and Zack get out and have some warm drinks, but Vasco realizes that Zack's rock and the Heroman box are still missing. Vasco again jumps into the river, intent on finding the rock. All the guys jump into the water as Mira and Crystal wonder if they should call the authorities again. Daniel starts drowning and is saved by Enu. While Crystal is desperately trying to make Daniel wake up,\nEli\nappears on the scene and creates another Good Luck rock. He hands it to Zack, who waves it at Vasco again. Everyone starts getting out of the river when Vasco notices something.\nZack ceremoniously turns to present the rock to Vasco again when he sees Vasco holding both the box and the rock. Vasco demands to know who was at the root of the problem, and everyone points to Zack. The party ends with Zack's K.O.\nJay\nis seen watching the 9 o'clock news as he sees Crystal kneeling over Daniel on television.\nZoe\nalso sees this and wonders sadly why Daniel is with another girl. Crystal, now in her new body, snaps a picture of this scene of the TV and happily saves it as her background picture on her phone.\nNotes\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

        "synopsis": "Episode 178\nJace\nfinds a worried\nVasco\nin a cherry tree field and asks what the problem is. He is mortified to find out Vasco is going on a blind date. He consults the\nBurn Knuckles\nbut quickly realizes they have no experience with women. He asks\nZack Lee\n, and he teaches Vasco how to corner a girl into a wall like a romantic. He ignores this advice but Vasco is awed.\nJace finds\nLeonn\nsurrounded by girls and she asks him if he is going to the fireworks event that night. He tells her about Vasco's date and asks for advice. Vasco tells Leonn he wants to get married someday. Leonn is offended and kicks Vasco, telling him to change his fashion sense. Later, she is seen working out to release her anger towards Vasco. She calls him an idiot for not realizing that he had asked a girl for love advice.\nJace begs\nJay\nto help Vasco prepare to the date since he is good at fashion. When Jace and Leonn spy on Vasco's date they are shocked to see she is very pretty. When they see Vasco finally appear they do not recognize him because he looks a lot better than he did before.\nEpisode 179\nJay worked very hard to change Vasco's appearance, giving him nice clothing and fixing his hair. As Vasco approaches the girl he does Zack's wall trick, but there is no wall, which confuses the girl. He takes her to a fish store which serves disgusting food, but she tries to be polite to him. As Vasco remembers Jace's advice, he holds the girl's hair up as she is eating food. Leonn laughs at Vasco's idiocy and Jace is horrified.\nThe girl runs off in tears and almost trips when Vasco catches her. He tells her he is sorry for being a terrible date, and that he is only inexperienced. The girl falls for his kindness and decides to give him another chance. Jace is happy to hear it but Leonn is not. She kicks him and walks away, and Jace suspects she has a crush on Vasco.\nNear the Han river Leonn skips stones, upset that Vasco's date is going so well. Vasco appears with the fireworks and asks if he is late to the event. Leonn is surprised that he remembered, and Vasco tells her he left his date because the Burn Knuckles are more important to him than love. She chases him with the firecracker and laughs at his stupidity.\nCookie 1\nVasco explains to the girl that he cannot date her because he wants to raise a kangaroo. He leaves her to go to the Burn Knuckles, and Jace is confused.\nCookie 2\nThe girl visits J high to find Vasco. She is shocked to see his actual appearance and doesn't believe it. When she runs into Leonn she mistakes her for a boy and falls for her, but is rejected immediately.\nCookie 3\nThe Burn Knuckles are celebrating Vasco's success by setting up a venue on how to date girls. Onlookers warn girls to stay away from the Burn Knuckles.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

He realizes he neglected his mother in his absence and becomes upset. She gives him money to thank him for being a good friend and he decides to cherish her gift as his lucky charm.\nAs Daniel gets up to leave he is confronted by\nVasco\n, who witnessed the event.\nThe Burn Knuckles\nhang out in the caf\u00e9 because\nJace\nworks there. Vasco thought Daniel was being paid not to bully his fat self, and tells Daniel to follow him so he can beat him.\nEpisode 18\nVasco takes Daniel to an abandoned field and starts fighting him. When Daniel asks what he did wrong Vasco tells him to return the money. Daniel refuses, and they start fighting again. Vasco tries to hit him straight but Daniel twists and knocks him out with a backspin elbow hit. He is shocked to see his body moving so naturally when he hasn't trained. Jace and the Burn Knuckles return later to find Vasco and are shocked to see him knocked out.\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

She attempted to escape several times, but had her attempts blocked as everyone she interacted with was a follower of the shaman.\nWhen Vin was nine, the girl she had doted on confessed she had witnessed one of the Shaman's assaults, who tried to reassure her by excusing it as a Judo. The next time she was called by the Shaman, she asked for him to stop, only for Shinmyung to intimidate her by saying it would only get worse for her son. This caused her to break into tears, asking what she did wrong, sending the Shaman into a rage as he begin to beat her. He would then tell her why he had been so horrible to her, the actual details unknown but seeming to involve a dark skinned woman who could possibly be\nTaejin Cheon\n's mother, and her own husband, Mujin Jin. The Shaman then strangled her, before her body would be hung by a noose in her and Vin Jin's reisdence, framing her death as a suicide.",

        "appearance": "Vin Jin is a tall, muscular man. His crew cut hairstyle, which was later changed to shaggy bangs\n[\n2\n]\n, is often obscured by a cap. He has polycoria (multiple pupils) in his left eye, with two gray irises (and pupils) joined horizontally; Vin Jin hides it with heavily tinted sunglasses which makes vision nigh-impossible. During a few of his fights, he has been seen wearing tinted goggles. In the later chapters, He wears a white jacket which reads \u201cti\u0101n li\u01ceng\u201d (\u5929\u5006) In Chinese characters that read as \u201cHeavenly Skilled\u201d on the right side.\nHis clothing has always consisted of wearing designer brands, as well as commonly wearing chains.\n[1]",
        "personality": "Vin Jin has quite an arrogant and selfish personality, believing he is the most handsome student at J High. He wishes to be superior among everyone, feeling jealous when someone else is better than him. This leads to bullying being his resolve, stepping on others so he can remain at the top. His carelessness makes him get into fights that he has a major disadvantage in.\nWhenever it comes to his eyes, he is very secretive. He covers them with tinted sunglasses, making him considerably handicapped when it comes to his sight. It was once stated that he tinted one pair of his sunglasses six times and was virtually unable to see.\n[\n3\n]\nHowever,  Vin Jin is quite insecure about his eyes and attempts to hide them even without his sunglasses, panicking when faced with the prospect of having them taken off. It is revealed in Chapter 381 that  Vin Jin's insecurities stemmed from his polycoria, going as far as attempting to gouge it out as a child due to being stigmatized for it.\nWhen it comes to his friendship with Mary Kim, he is shown to cover his considerate feelings with his playful comments and makes objectionable ideas. Deep down, he cares greatly for her,\n[\n4\n]\ngoing as far as to beat up Hostel members for using photos of her in their business.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Vin Jin specializes in Judo,\n[\n3\n]\n[\n5\n]\na martial art of unarmed combat that derives from Jujitsu. It mainly consists of unbalancing or flipping the opponent using one's leverage abilities. Later, it is discovered that he also specializes in Kudo,\n[\n6\n]\na martial art that originates from Japan where one uses punches, kicks, and submission techniques to overwhelm their opponent. In addition to this, he is well informed of dirty fighting and Korean wrestling.\n[\n7\n]\nAt the beginning of the comic, he is largely known for acting better than others, causing fights he has no mercy in. Later on, revealing that his sunglasses handicap  Vin Jin to the point he is almost blind. It is found that he is an extremely proficient fighter and martial artist. Without wearing his handicap, his speed, strength, and techniques are exponentially enhanced, as demonstrated when he easily took out Ivan Park.\n[\n3\n]\nHe has stated that he could beat those who are on the same fighting level as Daniel, Logan, and Zack Lee when he was in middle school.  This had been the definite case before most of the\n2nd generation\nmain\ncharacters\nreached mastery. Furthermore, Eugene implied Vin's strength is greater than anyone else's who is capable of being in the circus through his letter grading and possibly comparable to the likes of\nRyuhei\n, or at the very least at the level of\nkings\n.\nBy the time the cast began fighting against the Workers Second Affiliate, Vin Jin was able to destroy trees barehandedly and pose a serious threat in the underground fighting ring.\nWhen  Vin Jin joined Allied to combat the workers with his own goal being revenge on Taejin Cheon for his crimes upon Sujin, the two from Cheonliang were given the opportunity to fight to the death. It was also stated, in the battle, that Vin had gotten stronger than his middle school prime. However, at the climax of their fight, Taejin revealed just how much of an astronomical gap there was between the two. This is still relevant to  Vin Jin because he had reached a point of being at the higher level of kings while being considered one when  Vin and Taejin in the past weren't far off from each other in level. The consideration in itself is due to him being likely responsible of overtaking Cheonliang by first murdering the Cheonliang king.\nThe final piece of information about  Vin's power is the relevancy of Cheonliang throughout all of the generations as it is the breeding ground of monsters. The other known example, besides the two from the 2nd generation and the Cheonliang king from the 1st generation, is Jinyoung Park.  Vin's narrative in the next arc of Cheonliang starts with his flashback/backstory, which will be about the 1st generation and himself 10 years ago.\nFights\nHe was shown to do basic slaps, punches, and kicks, additionally grabbing opponents by the hair or collar.\n[\n8\n]\nHe had attempted a leg sweep on\nVasco\nbut failed to cause damage, getting handled by Vasco's one-handed flip.\n[\n5\n]\nWhen in conflict with\nLogan\n, he grabs him by the collar, saying \"rubber rubber arms,\" (most likely referencing Luffy from One Piece). Then, he grabs Logan by the collar and forearm of his shirt, attempting to flip, but gets beaten in return.\nDuring  Vin Jin's fight with\nIvan\n, after the removal of  Vin's sunglasses, he can increasingly rely on Ivan. After Ivan's counter-attempt to  Vin's Judo flip,  Vin tackles Ivan by the neck. He successfully evades Ivan's grapple endeavors with speed, attempting to pull him down by the arm, and is captured in Ivan's arms. He breaks out with his strength and lifts his arms.  Vin Jin then counteracts with a forbidden Judo move called Kani Basami, similar to Wrestling's 'Scissor Takedown,' in which he interlocks his legs around his opponent's waist and can either lay them on their back or break their knees.\nDuring his fight with Akira during Worker's Second Affiliate Arc in the fighting ring, he showed monstrous reaction speed avoiding Akira's attacks and then he dislocated his arms rendering him unable to fight. While fighting Sato Kazuma in the lobby he was beaten one-sidedly but didn't flinch. Once he fought back, he pulverized Sato by lifting and slamming him on the ground thus ending the fight quickly.\nIn the recent chapter while fighting\nChangyong Ji\nhe was unfazed by this headbutt and his attacks he picked\nJi\nwith one hand and slammed him on the ground repeatedly. When Ji tried to remove his grip Vin didn't even budge thus it proved his monstrous grip strength.\nIt was later revealed that he was the disciple of the First Generation King of Cheonliang\nSeongji Yook\n, who taught him how to fight. Seongji said that  Vin Jin had a lot of potential and he just triggered it by training him, It is also revealed that he was the son of\nJin Mujin\nthe legend of Korean wrestling and ssireum, a fighter said to be on par with\nGapryong Kim\n. Yook also taught him his father's fighting style called the\nMujin Ssireum\n, where one can break the opponents' bones with their monstrous grip strength.\nIn Busan arc he fought with the crew succesors event breaking their body parts criplling them with his grip strength he slo fought Jangyeon Na with ALLIED overpowering him making other hallucinating him as Seonji Yuk.\nFighting Style:\nKudo\nJudo\nSsireum\nJin Mujin Sserieum\nTechniques\nBasic slaps, punches, and kicks\nCollar grab + flip\nGrabbing shoulder and wrist + flip\nKani Basami\nBone Breaking\nQuotes\nTrivia\nVin Jin has an extremely rare eye condition called polycoria, where one has multiple pupils in one eye.\n[\n9\n]\nDespite outwardly hating Duke, he is a large fan of his rapping, which he vehemently denies.\n[\n10\n]\nOne of  Vin Jin's sunglasses is tinted 6 times more than normal.\n[\n10\n]\nVin Jin hates handsome guys, due to him feeling insecure and jealous since he was often bullied for his eye condition, which others called a curse.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 250: Wuthering J High School (1)\n\u2191\n3.0\n3.1\n3.2\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 200: God Dog (02)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 219: Runaway Fam (01)\n\u2191\n5.0\n5.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 93\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 279: Hostel (10)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 269: Hostel [Vasco vs Vin Jin]\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 92\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 381: Workers (2nd Affiliate) (10)\n\u2191\n10.0\n10.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 217: Jacedaichi Case Files (03)"

While Vin Jin was in this gang, as the boss, they would choose their boss by fighting while the ground was covered in shards of glass.\n[\n2\n]\nWhen he was in elementary school, his mother took him to Cheongliang so a shaman could fix Vin Jin's polycoria. This was soon revealed to be a religious scam as a 'sacrifice' was offered in order to transfer Vin's 'curse', his polycoria. His mother would try to take Vin Jin with her to escape Cheongliang, but such a thing proved impossible as every authority figure was part of the shaman's cult. As the two were kept under constant surveillance, Vin's mother eventually committed suicide, leaving Vin to become the new sacrifice at the age of eight, as the old one had run away.\nHe would be relentlessly bullied for his condition until he even attempted to gouge out his own eye, before standing up for himself and beating the children who had bullied him. As he graduated elementary and entered middle school, he became infamous for his eye and his strength, but wasn't strong enough to escape his position as a sacrifice.\nAs he fulfilled this position for the first time in years, the other kids from his school were there to witness the ceremony, causing Vin to finally run away out of shame and a desire to die to escape his life. The method he chose to die was to enter the cave of Cheongliang Mountain, where a horned monster was said to dwell that ate humans.\nIt was there he met his teacher, the King of Cheongliang,\nSeongji Yook\n.\nReference\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 262: One Night (5)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 269: Hostel [Vasco vs Vin Jin]"

        "history": "When Vivi was young she met Xiaolung and gave him his name, this makes Xiaolung fall in love with her. Once she's older, she gets attacked, by the people who are meant to protect her because of her ignorant, rude behaviour towards them. But then Xiaolung comes and saves her, this is probably the moment she started to develop feelings for him. He then becomes her bodyguard because of the incident. Once she's in high school she confesses her feelings for Xiaolung but he rejects her because he has sworn to be her bodyguard and nothing else, even though he does return those feeling, although he does not explain that to her.\nShe goes to Korea so that she can less conspicuously do drugs, due to the fact that she's an addict, because in China you can get executed for doing drugs, and since she is a multi-billionaire's daughter it can also cause  large media commotion. Another reason she goes to Korea is to become a part of the third affiliate, along with her several bodyguards, who have sworn to protect her.\nOnce Xiaolung gets severely hurt she shows a clear compassion for her love for him by running over to him and comforting him in her arms. After that they move back to China and start living in an unknown forest of bamboos in a little hut, dedicating that she will do everything that he did for her, due to the fact that he can no longer walk, and that she will stop doing drugs. After that he requests her to get him a blanket so she runs to the hut to get one but when she returns he's not there because her father did not approve of the relationship. But only told her that he was dead so she wouldn't persist. Xiaolung knew this and accepted the fact that their love could never work and left, with his master. Vivi is left heartbroken.\nEpisode 320\nShe gets high on LSD, but a cleanup crew covers her tracks and cleans up the hotel room she is staying in. Later, she goes outside to eat fishsticks from Vasco's stand, and Vasco wonders if she's drunk because her eyes are so empty. She falls and is about to get caught by Jake, but her bodyguard appears out of nowhere and picks her up, speaking to her in Chinese. After she leaves, Vasco realizes that she didn't pay.",

        "appearance": "Warren is tall young man, roughly the same height as\nEli\n.\nWarren possesses pale skin, black gelled hair, and a developed musculature. He has a rough appearance overall, and mainly wears black and white. In his middle school years he had short hair cut close to his head.\nCurrently, Warren after joining the Workers, wears a formal suit with a golden badge with the symbol of the crew, in addition to now having a kind of formal topknot.",
        "personality": "During his middle school years, Warren was shown to be very prideful, taking offense to anyone who insulted him or Max and Derrick. Warren has a strong moral compass and does not like stealing or being dishonest. He is considerate for those he has formed bonds with, keeping dedication to them by risking his life to protect his family. Even in minor situations, he will take great lengths to avoid stirring them any sort of trouble.\nHe has taken a huge crush towards\nSally\n. Before realizing Sally had feelings for\nEli\n, Warren would make unnecessary comments implying him and Sally doing couple things together. Afterwards, he now stays heedful and respectful that Sally does not reciprocate her feelings. He still continues to be protective of her, covering her eyes so she doesn't have to watch hurtful things, and going as far as fighting to defend her.\nHe enjoys calling himself, \"Gangdong's Mighty Warren Chae,\" and has the habit of keeping a fight record. He naturally speaks in a matter with words omitted from his speech in inconvenient places, which has become an ongoing joke for characters to comment on, however he seems to have fixed this habit as of late.",

It is noted that he came to the orphanage when he was 10, and has been watching over Max and Derek for 5 years (As of the\nEli Jang Arc\n. He hated to be looked down and made fun of, and would recoil by getting into fights with the students.\nWarren always had a crush on Sally Park, and was jealous of Eli Jang. He offered to stay in Sally's home to protect her from Eli, who he thought was dangerous. After some time, he grew closer to Eli and joined him in creating Hostel. When Eli left Hostel, Warren stayed behind for Sally Park, waiting for Eli to return.",
        "fighting_prowess": "Warren is an experienced and accomplished fighter given his ability to have thousands of wins with only 4 defeats (those defeats coming from the other members of the original Hostel). Warren has shown to be powerful enough in his younger years to defeat the entire Back Door crew with help from Max and Derek and was even be praised by Gun.\nWhen he first met Vasco, he was impressed by his incredible strength considering they were on are relatively equal level.\nJerry Kwon\nalso has high respect for Warren Chae because of his endurance and lack of skill. Early in his life, Warren possessed little in the way of a set style though understood the fundamentals of fighting making him a brawler. Despite this, Warren possesses a sense of honour and pride concerning fighting with opponents that fight unfairly such as Eli being a strong counter towards Warren. As a direct result of his continual exposure to street fights with no professional training, Warren Chae unintentionally adopted the fighting philosophy of Jeet Kune Do (JKD) (though many, including the author himself, refer to JKD as a style in addition to a philosophy). Warren Chae and JKD's philosophy mirror each other in that they espouse attacking the weakest areas of the human body with as much force as possible.\nHowever, after his encounter with\nSenior Manager Kim\n(SMK) (whom stated Warren Chae mirrored himself to a near uncanny degree when he was younger), SMK decided to offer Warren his expertise in JKD. As such, Warren now possesses not only his immense physical strength, speed, and fortitude on par with Jerry Kwon, but technical foundations in martial arts as a result of formal tuition.\nAs a result of his development, Warren Chae has stated that he would win a rematch with Jerry or Eli.\nAs of Episode 380 we learn that Warren's fighting skills have been corrected by SMK and he now has a foundation of CQC as well as his JKD proficiency\nIt is stated by Sinu Han that along with Eli Jang that Warren Chae has achieved Mastery. Even though both Eli and Warren have gotten a lot stronger and even took out a 1st gen king together they still are not on the same level as Sinu Han, as in their fight the only damage Sinu took was from a cheap shot from Mandeok Bang while Warren and Eli were both bloodied up and damaged, but Sinu was surprised by their endurance as they didn't fall yet even with the damage they took.\nIn the current arc It's shown that Warren developed his own\n\"New CQC Style\"\n. While fighting\nJerry Kwon\nwho almost defeated Warren,Its shown that Warren decided to bring out his own CQC style. It is shown in the flashback that while training again with Manager Kim, Warren was able to  make him kneel on his feet by using his\nNew CQC\n(\nwhich he developed by mixing his self taught JKD with the CQC\n). He used it deflect Jerry's full force punch and land a series of attacks on him to thus defeating him. The only drawback of this style is that  it leaves him unable to fight anymore after using it as the style pushes Warren's body to it's utmost limit just like he was unable to move properly at the end of his fight with Jerry.\nEven\nSenior Manager Kim(SKM)\ntold that due to the not having a particular pattern this style would be difficult to be copied by the \"Genius\" (reffering to\nJohan Seong\nas  he was able to copy the old CQC shown by\nSKM)\n.\nQuotes\n\"Nice to meet you, let me introduce myself. 1083 matches, 1079 wins, and 4 defeats. I'm Gangdong's Might Warren Chae.\"\n[\n3\n]\n\"Mister, we're no thugs like you. You know what Eli, I think he just looked down on us. We're Hostel. What are you gonna do now, mister?\"\n[\n4\n]\n\"A man never regrets anything. You're coming back like this, Eli Jang.\"\n[\n5\n]\n\"...Alright, so you're rich. ...I guess you can afford dentures.\"\n[4]\n\"Whew... I almost let my emotions take over my punches.\"\n[5]\n[1]\nTrivia\nWarren's unintentional adoption of Jeet Kune Do as his martial art mirrors JKD's founder, Bruce Lee. With most historians and experts agreeing that Lee begun the development of his style as a result of mainly street fights and his tutelage under Wing Chun (which itself is a martial art mainly known for its street fighting applications).\nWarren has the ability to walk silently as a result of SMK's training.\nWarren's speech impediment has been implied to be as a result of brain damage due to it being compounded after his fight with Eli Jang wherein he faced great difficulty and eventually lost.\nHis 4 defeats were against Derek and Max, Eli Jang, Jerry Kwon, and Gun Park.\nReferences\n\u2191\nEpisode 234\n\u2191\nEpisode 277\n\u2191\nEpisode 248\n\u2191\nEpisode 242\n\u2191\nEpisode 267"

        "name": "Workers",
        "history": "TBA\nOrganization\nThey are known to be the crew that strictly earns their cash through legal methods and are said to be very business-like. Jace mentions that Workers are more of an enterprise than a crew when explaining the concepts of the 4 Big Crews to Daniel. Their method for maintaining that they aren't a crew is by earning money through legal matters and official businesses, also dressing in strict business attire.\nUnlike God Dog and Big Deal, and like Hostel, Workers is split into several factions that are all recognized as part of the crew, but are separate factions that operate independently but are aware of each other and use similar means of recognizing status. For Workers, these are small badges with colors and patterns:\nBlack:\nVVIPs - Individuals to be treated with the utmost importance, there are only five of them in total. The five VVIPs are\nGun Park\n,\nGoo Kim\n,\nCharles Choi\n,\nJinyeong Park\n, and\nYuseong\n.\nWhite Gold:\nPresidents of each affiliate - only five exist.\nGold + Symbol:\nSenior members of Workers (Executives), Combat Experts, and Directors - important figures in maintaining their factions.\nGold:\nHired mercenaries or new members of Workers - Paid by the Factions, but do not necessarily know that the company belongs to Workers.\nNone:\nNormal workers in the factions and does not recognize the company as part of Workers, but do understand the badge statuses.\nThe Workers currently consists of four major affiliates that operate through illegal means, but cover up with a legal fa\u00e7ade to hide traces. The Workers acquired\nK House\nand\nWhite Tiger Job Centre\nthrough recent purchases. There was also a fifth affiliate added later on.\nFirst Affiliate: The Grimm Plastic Surgery Center\nThe Grimm Plastic Surgery Tower\nThe First Affiliate of\nWorkers\nis a plastic surgery hospital located at the heart of Seoul, with its legal business being that of a plastic surgery clinic directly managed and owned by the affiliate's president\nHangyeoul Baek\n.\nTheir illegal business has two forms: Regular patients, and VIPs. The handling of regular patients involves the dispatch of the clinic's private ambulances, allowing them to show up to emergencies and extort high fees from the loved ones of the patient. The handling of VIPS has them hunt powerful and/or wealthy people so that they can use section 24 of the Mental Health Act, where they can commit a person to a mental hospital, even without the consent of the concerned party as long as consent has been obtained from two people responsible for the person and a mental health professional. When admitting the person, their belongings/properties are distributed to those responsible, effectively usurping their effects and influence. Even though it is outside the law, the psychiatric hospital admits these people and abuses them, acting outside of human rights, and not even allowing the supposed patient to call an attorney.\nSecond Affiliate: Lucky Casino\nLucky Cassino\nThe second affiliate's legal business consists of a casino, while the illegal business is called \"Circus\", where they kidnapped the world's dangerous criminals, and left them to fight and die for the entertainment of the casino's VIPs, after the entry of\nDoo Lee\n, the Circus was reformulated, starting to be separated into four games, namely:\nAnt Shaking: The game is comprised of a game of rock, paper, scissors against the executive\nHyottoko\n, if the player loses,\nHyottoko\nslaps him with all his strength, if the player wins, he moves on to the next game, if he survives\nHyottoko's\nslap, he also advances to the next game. This phase has a secret:\nHyottoko's\npose at the beginning of the game is a direct hint of his chosen move, allowing the player to predict his choice.\nGas Hell: After the first game, the arena is suddenly flooded with (what appears to be) tear gas.\nQuest-ism: The game consists of VIPs sending missions to players, if the player completes his mission, in addition to receiving a reward in Won, he moves on to the next round.\nCatch-the-God: Players must fight and defeat/kill Executive\nShiba\n(after Sinu Han's departure, it remains a mystery as to how the most recent fourth game turned out).\nIts CEO is\nMitsuki Soma\n, known as Neko but she is temporarily removed from the position due to emotional incapacity, with the branch currently being run by the executive\nRyuhei Kuroda\n.\nThird Affiliate: Club ViVi\nEntrance of Vivi Club\nClub ViVi is a nightclub owned by\nVivi\n, their former president. Their legal business consisted of running the nightclub, whereas their illegal business was creating and distributing drugs across Korea, one significant example being the Pungsan cult.\nAt some point, the 3rd Affiliate was the branch that hosted Circus, where players fought naked, presumably to death.\nThe third affiliate's current president is unknown as\nSamuel Seo\n, the one who inherited the affiliate from Vivi, was stripped of his position by Eugene.\nFourth Affiliate: ONE MCN\nAccess card for ONE MCN\nONE MCN is a company that employs streamers to make money. The streamers come from many platforms such as PaprikaTV, Kwitch, and others. Many of these streamers work with legal contracts, but ONE MCN also employs minors to work in their illegal streaming business using fraudulent contracts. These minors are locked in rooms of tempered glass in ONE MCN's basement floor. They are forced to work without pay and are not allowed to leave the facility. Streamers are monitored using cameras and are kept in line via threats from hired mercenaries of the\nWhite Tiger Job Centre\n.\nONE MCN was purchased by Alexander Hwang after he made a fortune from Bitcoin following middle school. Hwang was later replaced by Samuel Seo, his former director. Following the downfall of the fourth affiliate at the hands of\nTom Lee\n, Charles Choi bought the company and its building and became the official owner of the fourth affiliate.\nThe fourth affiliate's current president is unknown as\nSamuel Seo\n, the one who inherited the affiliate from\nHwang\n, was stripped of his position by Eugene.\nFifth Affiliate: Loaning Business\nThe Fifth Affiliate is a loaning business devised by\nEli Jang\nafter he was forced to join Workers along with\nWarren\n. Its duties consist of going outside Seoul and forcing people to take loans before they are forced to have to pay a ridiculous sum of money in order to repay the loan.\nThe fifth affiliate's current president is unknown as Eli Jang, the affiliate's founder and president, has since abandoned his position to return to Hostel with Warren.\nMembers\nChairman\nEugene\nVice Chairman\nMandeok Bang\nVVIPs\nCharles Choi\nJinyeong Park\nGun Park\nYuseong\nGoo Kim\nPresidents\nHangyeoul Baek\nMitsuki Soma\nHeadquarters\nShigeaki Kojima\nHiroaki Kojima\nExecutives\nNo. 1\nRyuhei Kuroda\nKenta Magami\nSato Kazuma\nTaegon Wi\nHwang Ho\nSowol Jin\nHuseong Ha\nOld Face\nJin Jang\nChangyong Ji\nDosu Lee\nFormer Members\nHannya\nKitsune\nShiba Inu\nVivi\nXiaolong\nAlexander Hwang\nSamuel Seo\nEli Jang\nWarren Chae\nLogan Lee\nTaejin Cheon\nIsu Jo",
        "synopsis": "Workers (4th Affiliate)\nDaniel Park\njoined ONE MCN after receiving a card from Gun. He signed a contract along with\nNatalie Cho\nand\nAmy Lee\nto stream for ONE MCN, but the three of them were held hostage and forced to become part of ONE MCN's illegal streaming business. Daniel, Warren and Doo Lee infiltrated ONE MCN as VVIPs to expose their business and save the kidnapped streamers. They managed to find the streamers but were only able to save Amy and Natalie: the other streamers were taken away by the White Tiger agency to the Workers third affiliate, including the president. Daniel lost all evidence of their crimes except for a spy cam he used on his coffee cup during his disguise.\nSamuel Seo abandoned ONE MCN afterwards, leaving the company without a leader. However, he still maintained his status as the head of the fourth affiliate. Charles Choi eventually bought ONE MCN from the Workers and became its owner.\nWorkers (3rd Affiliate)\nClub Vivi was infiltrated by Daniel, in order to confirm the dealings inside. Both his bodies were used in order to infiltrate it.\nThe club was managed by\nVivi\n, a Chinese lady who hid in Korea to escape her traditional family, and partly to escape her drug charges in China. She was with\nXiaolong\n, her loyal bodyguard.\nThe Club Vivi closed out in the aftermath of the incident, Vivi forces to return to China and do the arranged marriage her father organised, which Xiaolung intervened. The control came at the hands of Samuel.\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)\nSinu Han\ndisappeared after taking the deal. Daniel had to join forces with\nJake Kim\nand\nBig Deal\nto infiltrate the club run by\nMitsuki Soma\n, that has casinos as a front, but actually an underground gladiator coliseum underground.\nWith the help of pre-\nAllied\ncrew and Jake, they infiltrated the coliseum, joining the death game themselves. In the midst of it, chaos happened. Eventually, they rescued Sinu Han and returned to the Shopping Street.\nThe affiliate came under\nEugene\n's direct control, and gave the control to\nRyuhei Kuroda\n.\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nDaniel Park\nhad to form the\nAllied\ncrew to infiltrate the 1st affiliate, in order to talk to\nJinyeong Park\n, and find clues where his other body was hidden, at the behest of one of the Pre Generation's clues. He had also called on to\nJerry Kwon\nand\nJake Kim\nto assist him in infiltrating, with\nJay Hong\n's assistance of acquiring an ambulance and\nJibeom Kwak\ndriving it, and also he wants to rescue\nJihan Kwak\n.\nThe 1st Affiliate was formerly an underground battle royale called \"Hell\", where the worst of the worst criminals in Korea had to fight to survive. Eugene labelled this the place where \"only the strong will survive\". The reigining champion was\nCheon Taejin\n.\nAfterwards, the 1st Affiliate was converted into a mental asylum, where Private First-Aid responders, led by Cheon Taejin would lock up said \"mentally unstable\" individuals for an indefinite amount of time unless specified, as per request by individuals. VIP's here, are imprisoned by their own request and taken care of like royalty.\nThe Affiliate was originally run by Eugene himself, and later handed to\nGyeol Baek\n, assuming\nHangyeol Baek\n's identity.\nAfter the destruction of the affiliate, Daniel Park entered a truce with Eugene to take down Charles Choi.\nCrew Strength\nTBA\nFighting Capabilities\nDue to their large numbers, the Workers have a large amount of competent fighters, some able to contend with the likes of the crew heads, some able to overpower them momentarily.\nAllies and Subordinates\nAllied\nAfter Daniel Park's revelation and the destruction of the First Affiliate, he offered a truce with Eugene in exchange for 2 things:\nA meeting with Chairman Steve Hong\nThe residence of Gun Park\nWeakness\nThe Workers possess Jinyoung Park and James Lee, two figures of utmost significance to Charles Choi, an extremely powerful figure, formerly Eugene's boss and a follower of the legend of the 0th Generation gapryong kim and he has close ties with the Yamazaki Syndicate in Japan and runs the HNH Group. This would result in the Workers being under constant threat of destruction as Charles works towards finding Jinyoung and capturing Eugene.\nGallery\nEp. 149\n- Jace talking about Workers\nEp. 170\n- Workers in a bar\nEp. 280\n- Jin ready to take Workers on\nEp. 286\n- Daniel holding ONE MCN Business Card from Fourth Affiliation\nEp. 292 - VVIPs.png\nEp. 292\n- VVIPs\nEp. 318\n- Club Vivi\nEp. 319\n- Entrance of Club Vivi\nEp. 319\n- Workers 3rd Affiliation\nEp. 325\n- Club Vivi\nEp. 330\n- Hotel Vivi\nEp. 330\n- The card system at Hotel Vivi\nEp. 330\n- Workers third affiliate executives\nEp. 338\n- Workers 3rd Affiliation first meeting\nEp. 341\n- Eugene meets with Samuel\nEp. 422\n- Changyong giving Eli a drink\nEp. 422\n- Workers\nEp. 422\n- Workers 2\nEp. 423\n- Daniel in front of Workers\nEp. 430\n- Workers assembled\nEp. 431\n- Workers Headquarters\nEp. 441\n- The Grimm Plastic Surgery Tower\nEp. 442\n- 5th Affiliate\nEp. 450\n- Workers 1st Affiliation\nEp. 451\n- Allied vs Workers\nWorkers symbol\nLucky Cassino\nTrivia\nReferences"

        "synopsis": "Episode 372\nA month after\nJiho Park's death\n,\nDaniel Park\ncontinues to work for the\nWorkers\n,\nZack Lee\napproaches him to let him know that people are worried about whatever he is up to with the Workers. At the end of class, Daniel goes with\nEugene\nto a limousine.\nDaniel asks Eugene when he will go to the 2nd affiliate, Eugene soon replies that he will visit the affiliate now, Eugene asks Daniel a question about which place can reveal the dark side of the human being, Eugene soon replies that no there's no right answer, but he believes that's where they are: a casino,\nLucky Casino\n, the 2nd affiliate of the Workers.\nDaniel gets excited and accidentally shouts with joy telling Eugene that he will expose the affiliate, but Eugene responds, saying that a casino for foreigners is allowed by the government, since the objective may be the acquisition of foreign currency, like the Seven Luck Casino or Paradise Casino, so Eugene shows Daniel Park that there are no illegalities in the affiliate, which affects Eugene's trust in Daniel Park.\nUpon returning home, Daniel realizes and regrets his emotional attitude, and thinks how he could do to get into the 2nd affiliate now, he can think of a method to get into it again.\nThen we see\nMary Kim\nclimbing a huge ladder to find\nVin Jin\n, who was pulling trees out of the ground as a form of \"training\" Vin Jin says that he has returned to his prime, and that he will go after everyone who underestimated him, including\nDaniel Park\n.\nSoon after, we see\nWarren Chae\nin a small boat, with\nManager Kim\non an island, he seems to have just left a training session with the manager.\nIn the end, Eugene goes to visit the dark side of the 2nd affiliate and meets with CEO\nMitsuki Soma\n, who takes him to see the end of the Circus (the true illegality of the affiliate), he sees\na man with a mask of a dog\n, this man has just easily beaten several other men in orange clothes, so he introduces himself to\nEugene\nas \"chairman\"\nEpisode 373\nDaniel Park\nsets up a meeting with\nEugene\nto talk about joining the\n2nd affiliate\n, but Eugene doesn't want to allow it, until Daniel makes a proposal to enter with a condition that is yet to be revealed.\nDaniel Park thus manages to enter the affiliate, however, for that, he had to leave school, go only with a suitcase that would be searched and he could only leave the place with Eugene's permission.\nEugene\nnotifies\nSamuel Seo\nthat Daniel Park will be joining the 2nd affiliate, still with the condition undisclosed, Samuel says that, knowing the affiliate, he is worried about\nDaniel Park\n.\nThe next day,\nZoe Park\nnotices that\nDaniel\ndid not go to school and notifies\nZack Lee\n, soon after, he goes to the room where\nBurn Knuckles\nis to warn\nJace Park\nand\nVasco\n, Zack shows a lot of concern about what may have happened to Daniel .\nVin Jin\nand\nMary Kim\ngo back to school, Vin looks for Daniel Park and does not find him, he warns that Vin Jin from\nCheonliang\nis totally different from Vin of\nJ High\n.\nEugene\nand\nMandeok Bang\nwait for\nDaniel Park\nto arrive at Lucky Casino, Mandeok Bang searches Daniel and finds nothing suspicious and then proceeds through an elevator, which takes them to the dark side of the 2nd affiliate, there Eugene leaves Daniel without even introducing him to the executives, who are all (or appear to be) Japanese, Daniel, feeling intimidated by them, tries to say something in Japanese, the attempt is interrupted by an executive who is Korean, he mingles and talks with Daniel, until he reveals himself to be\nSinu Han\n.\nMeanwhile, on\nBig Deal\n's street,\nJerry Kwon\nmeets to let\nJake Kim\nknow that someone is wanting to talk to him, for some reason, Jake misses Sinu even more today.\nEpisode 374\nSinu asks Daniel who is looking for him. Daniel is about to mention Jake but is interrupted when Mitsuki approaches Sinu telling him not to take his mask off. Daniel bows and shakes hands with Mitsuki, but gets a glare from her. Mitsuki walks away with his arm around Sinu. Nomen then bumps into Daniel on purpose, angering Daniel. Hannya approaches Daniel and puts her hand around Daniel's neck.\nThe scene cuts to Hannya throwing Daniel against the wall in one of the rooms. Daniel is ready to fight Hannya, but then it is revealed that Hannya is Doo Lee, who wanted to push Daniel away, Doo Lee talks about the place being 100% guarded 24 hours a day, so it's impossible for them to plot anything there, and also introduces the other executives, Daruma, Hyotokko and Nohmen, both three are Japanese, the conversation between Daniel and Doo is interrupted by Nohmen, who enters the room, they quickly pretend a situation where Doo is beating Kitsune (Daniel), after that, Doo Lee showcases the affiliate's shady business.\nWe see several men, criminals and before anything can be seen, the scene is cut by Daniel, who left the place to vomit, after seeing what happened, after that, the condition of entry for Daniel Park in the 2nd affiliate of the Workers is revealed , he delivered 4 of his friends to fight in the affiliate's obscure business, the \"Circus\", being chosen by Eugene, Daniel counts on his friends to get through it.\nEpisode 375\nThe episode starts with\nSinu Han\nin the shower staring at the ceiling after a tournament.\nMitsuki\napproaches him from behind and hugs him while nude. She tells him \"Great job today, too\" in Japanese.\nDoo\nand\nDaniel\nare both meeting in Daniel's room. Doo asks Daniel again if Daniel's really planning to make his friends join the Circus. And Daniel confirms. Doo asks Daniel if he's out of his mind especially after Daniel saw what kind of games they plan in the Circus. But Daniel response that it doesn't matter and that he's going to betray the alliance.\nEugene is eating with Neko as\nMandeok\nguards behind Eugene and\nNomen\nguards behind Neko. Eugene tells Neko that he doesn't believe that Daniel is going to betray the alliance because Daniel was the one who destroyed the 3rd and 4th affiliates. Eugene believes that Daniel is planning to make Workers think that he betrayed the alliance just so he can destroy the 2nd affiliate. So, then Eugene says how he'll make members of the alliance participate in the alliance so that Workers can eliminate them. Eugene thanks Neko for helping him out. Neko thanks Eugene for letting her meet Sinu. But then she her knife at Eugene's neck telling him that if anyone dares to ruin what they have, she will murder them, including Eugene. Mandeok blocks the knife from getting any closer to Eugene and the two continue to talk. Mitsuki wonders if Daniel will form a group to clear the Circus. But Eugene tells her that there's no need to worry about that since Eugene chose specific participants for the Circus.\nWarren\n,\nSally\nand\nZack\nmeet Daniel's second body in a warehouse. Sally asks why he has called them over. Daniel then notices\nVin Jin\nwith the group. Vin Jin tells Daniel that he followed Zack to the location and asks Daniel to come at him. However, Zack runs up to Daniel grabbing him by the collar and asking why Daniel skipped school and that Zack was worried for him. But Daniel brushes Zack's hand off.\nEugene steps out from the second floor explaining to the four of them that Daniel has become part of\nWorkers\nand that they've fallen into Workers' trap. Daniel then runs up to Warren, giving him a kick. Daniel puts his kitsune mask on and tells them that he's one of the Workers now. The three of them besides Vin realizes that Daniel has betrayed them. Vin Jin is confused as to what Daniel is talking about, and Daniel wonders why Vin is there. Warren punches Daniel, and realizes that when Daniel was talking with Eugene at the summit, that was when Daniel had betrayed them.

        "synopsis": "Episode 330\nJake\ncalls\nJerry\nand\nLineman\ninto Hotel Vivi, all three of them disguised with tracksuits.\nMandeok\ntells\nEugene\nabout this and asks if this means they are at war with\nBig Deal\nnow. Eugene says it is not war since there are only three men, but that he won\u2019t sit back and do nothing.\nJake and the team go to\nOld Face\nwho is tied in the bathroom, and he tells them that the captives are on the top floor. To get there, they will need to take a badge from one of the four executives of the\nWorkers\nthird affiliate: Hwang Ho, Taegon Wi, Sowol Jin and Huseong Ha.\nDaniel\nis captured in a tub when he wakes up. The rich kids are screaming for him to be murdered, and\nViv\ni concocts a stronger version of hydrochloric acid to melt him with.\nJake Kim calls\nZack Lee\nand tells him that the Workers have Daniel, and Zack calls\nVasco\nand\nEli\nto Hotel Vivi. Hwang Ho is angry that he lost to Vasco, and is preparing to crush him.\nSamuel Seo\ngets a call from the Workers allowing him to dispatch to the third affiliate.\nZack arrives on a bicycle and finds the other two waiting for them, but the three of them are blocked by\nJohan Seong\n. He refuses to move since\nXiaolong\npromised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job.\nEpisode 331\nThe suited up worker is about to spill acid on Daniel when he trips and spills it on the ground. The bodyguards ask what he is doing and he bodies them while Daniel uses Sophia's bone squeeze escape technique to run out of the room. The worker removes his mask and reveals that he is Doo Lee, and he wanted to repay Daniel for the troubles he gave him at the convenience store.\nZack, Vasco and Eli are fighting Johan and they are all having a difficult time. The two of them grab Johan's legs and tell Eli to go ahead without them. When he disappears inside, Zack tells Vasco that he should go as well to help save people, although he is not sure if he can beat Johan.\nXiaolong tells a hotel couple to stay inside since there is a disturbance in the hotel. He is surprised that Daniel turned out to be one of the intruders, and he wonders if there are others working with him. Huseong hits Daniel out from the bathroom and prepares to kill him. Lineman steps out from his hiding place and tells Huseong to leave Daniel alone since he's just a kid. He tells Daniel to run and that he'll be fine, since he is a member of Big Deal, despite being afraid himself.\nEli Jang walks through the kitchen when he is attacked by Taegon Wi. He draws his weapon, but then realizes he brought Yenna's toy wand instead of his baton.\nEpisode 332\nXiaolong is informed about the intruders, who are fighting executives. He tells the guard to tell the executives they can kill any intruder. He locks Vivi in her room and guards the outside.\nTaegon Wi grew up without a family in China. He was targeted by kidnappers as a kid, and he did whatever he could to survive. When he became older he was approached by Xiaolong who offered him a position. Although he has been in Korea for some time, he hasn\u2019t found any opponents as strong as those in China.\nTaegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli\u2019s baton away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.\nLineman is still standing after taking a beating from Huseong. Huseong asks why his tattoos aren\u2019t colored in, because it looks amateur. Lineman says he can\u2019t color them because Jake called him Lineman. Huseong decides to end things when Jerry comes out of the bathroom. Lineman asks Jerry if his act was worthy of Big Deal before passing out.\nEpisode 333\nHuseong Ha was abandoned at a zoo when he was a newborn. A male gorilla decided to raise him, and he treated it like his mother. The authorities took Huseong out and he entered society, but he was always curious about why humans are weak. He joined the army and later founded the Gorilla gang. Later on, his gang was sold to the Bicheon gang by the authorities. Xiaolong approached him at dinner and asked him to help protect someone.\nHuseong asks Jerry if he is trying so hard because Jake is watching him. Jake offers to get the badge for Jerry but he tells Jake to take Lineman and Daniel and leave. Once they are gone, Jerry punches Huseong into the wall, and his head breaks a hole into it. Huseong realizes Jerry was hiding his strength to not outshine Jake. Lineman returns and sees the wreckage, and Jerry tells him not to reveal that he is stronger than Jake. Vasco comes across Hwang Ho and uses Brekdak\u2019s 7th forbidden move, dough kneading. Hwang sees it coming and blocks the attack.\nSamuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he\u2019s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn\u2019t need help, since Johan is reliable enough. Samuel offers to help out if Xiaolong barks like a dog.\nEpisode 334\nJake takes Daniel and Tiktaktok girl to a room so they can pretend to be guests, warning them not to leave. Daniel asks the girl to go to sleep, and he tries to turn into his other body but it won\u2019t wake up. Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what\u2019s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.\nThe disfigured men attack Eli and he is surprised how little they care about being damaged. They even injure each other trying to kill him. Elsewhere, Vasco tries to get the badge from Hwang but the henchmen grab him. They are doused with gasoline, and they light a match while holding Vasco. The three musketeers are climbing the elevator when they arrive at a floor filled with the disfigured henchmen. They are even on top of the elevator.\nSamuel explains that during the Great Chinese Fire, 103 children were burned. Xiaolong took them in and turned them into warriors to protect Vivi. They are part of the Bicheon gang (Bi meaning queen, Cheon meaning sky and heaven). Samuel doesn\u2019t think they are as strong as Big Deal however. Jake, Jerry and Lineman mow down the men and arrive at Vivi\u2019s room.\nEpisode 335\nVasco managed to avoid being burned, and the fire alarms have been turned on. In the wet, Vasco, Eli and Big Deal try to fend off the Bicheon gang, but they keep rising back up. Jerry grabs Lineman by the head and clears a path for Jake. Lineman pulls down a grate to block the horde.\nThe three of them face Xiaolong. Vivi breaks open the door and yells at Xiaolong for locking her inside, but he tells her to stay there and closes the door again, locking it with his spear. He tells Jake he will have to kill him if he wants to enter the door. Jake tells Xiaolong he isn\u2019t protecting Vivi simply out of loyalty, and the flashback begins.\nXiaolong was among 108 unregistered Chinese children. He participated in a brutal match where he had to slaughter his fellow brothers in order to be recognized by Vivi\u2019s father. He took him in as a guard to watch over Vivi. Xiaolong throws away Lineman and knocks Jerry into the ground.\nXiaolong says that Big Deal have already failed since their reinforcements are coming (Johan). Johan makes his way to Vivi\u2019s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he\u2019s working with the third affiliate when they\u2019re responsible for the Punsang cult.\nEpisode 336\nSowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. Jerry is fighting Xiaolong and he wishes to have seen his weapon, and Xiaolong says it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. He remembers killing his mutinous brothers and sisters when they decided to rise against Vivi. He trained hard to be able to protect Vivi with or without a weapon. Jake steps in to continue the fight for Jerry, who is out cold.\nEpisode 337\nXiaolong recalls when he sent Taegon Wi to monitor Jake Kim, going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well. He is shocked to see how powerful Jake was. Gun hears people comparing him to Xiaolong and says he would have to fight him in order to see how strong he truly is.\nJake tells Xiaolong that he\u2019s going to take Vivi to get information about the Workers No.8, Sinu Han. Jake runs towards Vivi\u2019s room and Xiaolong races after him. Jake throws the spear at Xiaolong, and when he\u2019s dodging he grabs his head and slams him into the ground. With Xialong incapacitated, he walks to Vivi\u2019s door.\nXiaolong recalls being promoted to Cheon No.1 by the current master Jiou Jeon. He is taught Cheon Hohuigong, a martial art that is passed down to the Cheon guards. It\u2019s about making the body into a weapon. Xiaolong declines the offer to protect the chairman because he wants to protect Vivi. Gun continues his narration by saying he would have had to fight Xiaolong because he doesn\u2019t know how he would fare against his martial art. In present day Xiaolong rises again to fight.\nJohan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.\nEpisode 338\nXiaolong starts using his broken arm as a whip. When Xiaolong dodges his fingers he slashes him in the face with his hair, which is concealing blades.\nHwang Ho recalls meeting with his peers: Huseong Ha of Gorilla gang, King Gon Taegon Wi, Hongwol Sowol Jin and Hwang Ho. Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest by fighting, and Hwang decided to challenge him. When Hwang asked why they were fighting, Taegon said because he is obviously the strongest of the four.\nHwang Ho decides he will go full force for Vasco, and Vasco warns him that people die from Brekdak\u2019s five most powerful skills. They prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away. Daniel starts climbing outside the hotel so he can get to the penthouse.\nEli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan says to give the badge or else he will kill him.\nEpisode 339\nGun is asked how strong Eli is compared to the others. He says Eli could have been strong if he continued fighting, but he took a three year break. Without doing any training in that time, the others would have surely surpassed him. However, Eli has been doing some training. When Tom Lee found out Eli had a daughter, he kidnapped her. He kept her away from Eli until Eli regained his animal instincts: namely, being sneaky with stronger opponents. In one month he managed to win back Yenna from Tom.\nJohan throws Eli\u2019s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna\u2019s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.\nJerry and Lineman wake up and are shocked to see Jake scarred from his fight. Jake tells Xiaolong he didn\u2019t want to get serious, because he was losing his mind thinking about revenge. He\u2019s willing to drop the facade for Xiaolong and pretend that he is Gun.\nEpisode 340\nThe juvenile detention guards are chatting about their worst inmates when one of them brings up Gun Park. He used to fight the most violent inmates every day, staining the walls with their blood. Jake Kim surpassed him though, making the bloodstains even higher.\nXiaolong gets beat into another flashback. He remembers Vivi giving him his name Xiaolong, meaning \u201cLittle Dragon\u201d. Vivi wanted to befriend Xiaolong, but he never had time for her because he didn\u2019t want to indulge in her feelings. She even confessed to him but he apologized and said he didn\u2019t deserve her. Xiaolong eventually became a eunuch so he could protect Vivi without her father\u2019s suspicion.\nJake breaks Xiaolong\u2019s two arms, and he tries to attack with his mouth. Jake grabs hold of Xiaolong and warns him that if he continues, he may never walk again. Xiaolong says he never intended to walk away from this battle, and Jake breaks his legs.\nJake opens the door for Vivi and tells her they are leaving. Vivi says that she isn\u2019t leaving without Xiaolong and she sees him broken on the ground. Xiaolong crawls to Vivi and she runs to embrace him. Vivi and Xiaolong cry together, and he barks like a dog. Samuel hears him and smirks.\nEpisode 341\nDaniel gets to the penthouse and releases the tied up influencers. They tell him there\u2019s one more guy locked in another room, and he goes to investigate.\nXiaolong tells Samuel he will do whatever he wants if he protects Vivi. Samuel says he doesn\u2019t want to. He was ordered by Eugene to help him break up the third affiliate\u2019s current leadership, since they\u2019re causing trouble. He wanted to make use of Vivi\u2019s relationship with her father, but the leader of T Company refused to do business with them. If Samuel can bring Vivi to Eugene, he will be able to run the third affiliate.\nSamuel mocks Xiaolong and tells Jake they are allies now. Jake asks what he is going to do with Vivi, because he needs her to tell him where Sinu is. Samuel says he will tell him about Sinu later but Jake doesn\u2019t trust him, and they start fighting. As they are fighting, Daniel is thrown out between them. He warns them to run. The lights start flickering and influencers run away screaming. Daniel\u2019s second body appears in ultra instinct form.\nEpisode 342\nDaniel tries to understand why his second body is moving on its own. Samuel and Jake try to attack UI Daniel, but they aren\u2019t doing damage. Jake is ashamed of fighting double, but at the moment all he can think of is survival. Jerry offers to help in spite of his fear. He gathers all his strength into one punch, but Daniel uses the punch to power his own kick. Jake takes the shot and is knocked into a building.\nSamuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.\nEpisode 343\nJohan\u2019s past enemies and friends hype up how powerful he is as he\u2019s fighting Daniel\u2019s UI form. Samuel and Jake watch the two of them fight. UI Daniel uses the kyokushin and a triple kick on Johan, followed by systema and capoeira.While Johan is simply copying moves, Daniel has mastered them. Johan keeps fighting in hopes that he can copy Daniel\u2019s moves and gain some experience for fighting Gun. He is eventually overpowered. Daniel is about to step on him when Goo arrives, carrying Xiaolong\u2019s spear. He takes in the situation and then gets serious with Daniel.\nEpisode 344\nGoo pretends he isn\u2019t interested in fighting Daniel before slicing at him with the spear. Daniel dodges it and the two of them begin fighting. Goo keeps on rambling and looking for openings, but Daniel isn\u2019t letting up. Daniel breaks his weapon and Goo becomes serious for once.\nLogan Lee arrives in the elevator to see Goo lying on the ground, bloodied and with a broken arm. Daniel is unconscious on the ground. Goo complains to Logan that he had to use\nbatto\n, and Goo corrects him that he used Korean kendo instead.\nLogan picks up Vivi and Xiaolong to take with him. Daniel tells him to leave them there or he\u2019ll kill him. Daniel remembers telling Sophia that the other reason he wanted to become strong was so he could beat Logan Lee, since he can also copy moves.\nEpisode 345\nGoo knocks out Logan and tells him to not cause any trouble. They have a stare down and Logan leaves. Jake tells Goo he can\u2019t take Vivi and Xiaolong. Goo asks if he can put a pause on his revenge scheme since there will be a war soon. He asks Jake to let him go just this once, and Jake begrudgingly obliges.\nVasco wakes up and is disappointed in his loss, vowing to be the main character next time. Zack is also depressed from his loss, and the fact that he cannot help his friend. He is filled with grief and his chest starts feeling hot. Samuel walks to Jake and asks if he still wants information from Vivi. Jake says Goo already left, but Samuel mentions there\u2019s a basement in Club Vivi that only the executives can go to. He says Jake can still meet Sinu if he wants.\nEpisode 346\nSamuel takes Jake to the basement, where there is a lit room with a stage and multiple bleachers. Sinu used to fight here in the Workers\u2019 underground fighting ring. He and other prisoners were treated like animals and had to fight year long under grueling conditions. Samuel used to talk to Sinu during his breaks, but Sinu only remembered Jake and how he would save him. Samuel wondered if it was a side effect of the drugs he was taking. He would give him a pen to write with so he could have some amount of freedom, and Sinu would write on the walls. He filled the walls and the floor with the names of the Big Deal members so he wouldn't forget. Jake demands Samuel tell him where SInu is captured. He tells Jake that Sinu was moved to a bigger stadium, and that he brought him to this room to have a private place to speak. Samuel also says he will help him find Sinu if Jake helps him become king.\nDaniel returns home and is upset that he didn\u2019t do much, but happy that everyone is safe. He managed to steal some of Vivi\u2019s cookies, so he plans on giving it to Steve Hong. He bumps into DG and drops the cookie, which the latter picks up and says he will be confiscating.\nNotes\nReferences\nNavigation\nv\n\u2022\ne\nEpisode

The viewers also comment on the lack of sleep she was getting, and the high amount of food she was eating. One streamer tells her to pick up a strawberry if she was kidnapped, and Jamie does so. Some of the viewers are skeptical, while others are concerned for her. Under the table, two grown men glare at her and urge to her behave. The introduction ends.\nAmy\nand\nNatalie\napply to a job at MCN. They get the job quickly after\nSamuel\n, the CEO, sees that they do not have a background. He introduces them to the five most popular Kwitch streamers, which the two girls find strange.\nAt school,\nDaniel\nholds up the One MCN card that\nGun\nhad given him and observes it, wondering what he should do.\nDoo Lee\nwalks up to him, fascinated. He says that he had been trying to get into streaming. He watched Doo Lee stream, but the viewers are not happy.\nAt home, Daniel tries it again in his old body, and instantly gets many people to watch him. He shows them what a loser he was in school, and the audience finds it relatable.\nThe next day, Daniel goes to MCN in his new body while carrying his old body in a suitcase. He has a brief encounter with Samuel, who confirms that he is a member of\nWorkers.\n[\n1\n]\nEpisode 288\nSamuel\nadmits that he is a member of the\nWorkers\n, which stands for \u201cThe Union of One Hundred Billion Dollars\u201d, and that their goal is to make that amount. He asks\nDaniel\nif there is a problem, and Daniel has no response. Samuel gives him an interview and says he wants Daniel to work with them since he is great at building an audience.

He is about to leave when he sees\none of the streamers\nblocking the doorway, the short one with an odd mouth. Daniel hides under the table with him as\nSamuel\nbursts into the room and then leaves.\nDaniel decides to sign the contract since he didn\u2019t get much information.

He also leads the Bicheon Gang which consists of 103 fire survivors from an incident.\nBefore meeting Vivi and her dad, as a child, he was among 108 unregistered people\u2014 no identity, nationality, or family. He was shown in bloodshed where he had killed his \u2018brothers\u2019 he'd grown up with and that ends with him earning his \u2018right\u2019. He was then introduced to Vivi\u2014 someone who [he] is going to protect forever, someone [he] has to give his life for.\nAfter fighting Jake Kim in the Hunt for Big Deal and realizing the truth, Xiaolung returned to China just in time to stop Vivi's arranged marriage and ran away with her so they could finally be together.",

Despite that, Xiaolung's fighting style has no difference whether or not he is physically holding the Guandao, being able to replicate the movements with the Guandao with nothing in his hand, making it appear as though he is striking with an unclenched fist. This martial art style is highly secretive, entitled \"\nCheon Hohuigong\".\nHe is immensely strong, enduring, and overwhelming Jerry Kwon with little difficulty and only later matched by Jake Kim after he trained for months in prison to surpass Gun. However, Xiaolung exhibits great durability and grit, having fought even after having his elbow dislocated by Jake. In fact, Xiaolung decided to fight with his broken arm like a whip.\nQuotes\nForgive me... I am merely a sword to protect you\nIt will be fine. And even if it\u2019s not fine...

After watching Daniel and Duke perform, she meets Daniel (in his new body) in class and starts flirting with him, stating that his performance was great. After that, Yui starts being exceedingly generous to Daniel, even offering him a wallet of an expensive brand. Startled at such a gift, Daniel rejects the present, stating that it is too much. Yui then seduces him with a flirty yet innocent look in her eyes. Daniel blushes and realizes that she may be interested in him. From then on, he starts to have a crush on her.\nDuring class, Zoe asks her friends if they want to go to karaoke. While everyone else in the group agrees to go, Yui states that she would prefer to go shopping. Everyone instantly changes their mind and decides to go shopping instead. When they all go shopping, Zoe brings out a light blue pouch with a picture of a doll and asks if she should buy it. Everyone else turns to Yui to wait for her opinion and she says that it looks ugly and that it doesn't suit her. Everyone else immediately agrees, which Zoe all sullen.\nNext morning, Zoe sees that Yui has the exact same pouch and gets confused by that fact that she called it ugly and then proceeded to buy it. When she tries to confront Yui about it, Yui and her friends ignore her and pretend that she didn't even say anything. Daniel enters the room and Zoe becomes delighted, but then she sees Yui flirt with him, with him shyly flirting back.\nLater that night, Yui continues broadcasting, acting all innocent and cute. She watches as some viewers were competing to see who could pay her more and she smiles sadistically. Yui then talks about how she started playing 'Heroes of the Storm' and asks her viewers if they want to challenge her in the game. A while after all the broadcasting had ended, Yui starts to take out a cigarette and smoke, just before a boy uncovers himself from under the blankets. He gets agitated and asks how long they are going to keep their relationship a secret, and Yui calls him a 'goof'.\nShe then proceeds to smile innocently while stating that people won't give her any balloons if they find out that she has a boyfriend and gives her boyfriend the wallet which she tried to give Daniel. Thrilled at such an expensive gift, Yui's boyfriend says that he can suck it up. Yui gets on top of him and acts all sweet and caring, only to think that he's a bore and she then starts to wonder what Daniel is up to.\n[\n2\n]\nDaniel, wanting to make sure that she'll accept his old body, asks Yui of what she thinks of fat people. She states that 'people are still people' and Daniel gets pleased at her response. He then thinks of her as 'innocent', 'sweet' and 'different from the other girls' while Yui smiles at him sweetly. Yui then proceeds to smile wickedly at Zoe in a sinister way while Zoe watches them in misery.\nWhile Daniel, Duke and Park Ji Ho hang out together, Kim Hui sits in front of her computer in anger as she stares at how high Zoe's rankings have become. Desperately wanting to be better than Zoe, Yui tries to act cute and innocent by saying that she 'poo-pooed', only to realize that just sounds weird. Even then, people give her balloons because they think she's cute and Yui sits there, gladdened, stating that pretty people get paid, no matter what.\nAfterwards, Yui and her boyfriend go to the shop which the old body of Daniel works at and Daniel gets thrilled to see Kim Yuk there and thinks that her boyfriend is actually just her brother. When Kim Yuk and her boyfriend bring a pack of condoms to counter, Daniel gets confused and asks himself why siblings would want to buy such an adult product together. Kim Yuk notices him staring at the box and asks if he's ever seen those before and calls him a pig.\nHe then sees that Yui's acting rude and he gazes at her in confusion, not saying anything. Her boyfriend, noticing him gazing at her, orders him to lower his eyes and says that he knows what Daniel is thinking when he looks at her. Yui glares at Daniel and coldly muttered that he makes her sick, which shows even more of her true colors. Daniel then gets reminded of how kind Yui acted towards him in his new body, not realizing that he was still gawking at her. She then tells her boyfriend that she thinks he's a pervert and her boyfriend immediately swings his arm at Daniel, only to have Daniel dodge it \u2014 to everyone's surprise. Getting embarrassed that he missed, Yui's boyfriend tries to punch Daniel again, only to be stopped by Zack. Zack calmly asks Yui's boyfriend to not hit Daniel, since he owes Daniel something. Yui's boyfriend, annoyed by this statement, goes towards Zack to fight, calling him 'arrogant' and 'a disrespectful kid'.\nZack notices the expensive branded wallet in Yui's boyfriend's hand, which Yui first tried to give to Daniel, and Zack states that she's nervy. He asks in surprise that she had a boyfriend all along and her boyfriend stares at him in confusion, not knowing what was going on. Zack then informs that she tried to give it to Daniel but he refused it, and Yui gets shocked.\nYui, not wanting her boyfriend to know, says that he's lying and pleads to her boyfriend so then that they could leave. Yui's boyfriend, interested, stops Yui and asks Zack to go on. To Yui's horror, Zack explains that Yui secretly loves a 'pretty boy' in her class and likes to give him presents, and that the 'pretty boy' likes her too. After going on about how she loves him and tries to get his attention, Yui's enraged boyfriend punches her in the nose, making it bleed. He continues to kick her body while she's on the ground and step on her head, and this shocks and angers Zack.\nZack walks towards Yui's boyfriend and says that he shouldn't hit a girl. This annoys her boyfriend and he tries to harm Zack, even though Zack kept punching him back. After finally beating Yui's boyfriend with his own two hands, Zack states that 'you should not hit a flower, even if it's with a girl' even though it's actually meant to be 'you should not hit a girl, even if it's with a flower'. Right then, Yui becomes grateful towards Zack and falls in love with him.\n[\n3\n]\nYui comes back to school with her face bruised. She approaches Daniel and Zack's seat with a handkerchief. To the surprise of Zack, instead of giving it to Daniel she offers it to Zack instead, thankful that he protected her. She also states that she broke it off with her boyfriend.\n[\n4\n]\nWorkers (4 Affiliates) Arc",

He doesn't have a martial art, said by Yohan, Yuseong has not learned anything about martial arts techniques, since his form is terrible, but with destructive blows\n[\n4\n]\n, therefore, Yohan concludes that he is strong by his fighting instinct.\nHis true strength was better demonstrated during his fight with Tom Lee. He was able to launch Tom Lee flying and was dodging most of his attacks. Tom Lee kept praising him, stating that he is very fast and despite his small body, he is able to keep up. Even though Tom Lee trained Eli and fought Johan, he regarded that Yuseong is probably the strongest among his peers.\nIn the Hunt for Big Deal arc we saw the heights of his power and it was immense, first off he was barely on the losing end of a fight with 'Base' Johan until he started smiling, what Eugene mentioned is that Yuseong was never seen smiling in a fight because winning a fight is too easy for Yuseong. Once Yuseong started smiling he demolished Johan without any effort, it was to the point that Johan couldn't react and see his attacks. After getting overwhelmed with zero effort by Yuseong, Johan attempted to copy (Perfect/2nd Body) UI Daniel Park (he obviously wasn't as strong or fast as him) and they were evenly matched with Yuseong outlasting the 10 seconds that Johan had and forced Johan more strain on his muscles and nervous system to release the signature \"Take it Back\" kick, but Yuseong blocked it and passed out for a couple seconds. Eugene claimed that Johan had won the fight but while Johan used CQC to try and take out Eugene, Yuseong got back up to take the attack and Johan gained a begrudging respect for Yuseong for being strong and protecting family. Also while Johan passed out and was out of the war Yuseong ended up going on to fight both Daniel Park and Gun Park. Yuseong has immense stamina, durability and endurance along with his strength and speed as he was able to effortlessly first destroy Jake Kim in a fight with Jake saying that he felt pathetic, then Yuseong jumped out of a window and ran down the school buildings wall, ran to Eugene's location, fought Johan Seong, took CQC and (Walmart UI) attacks, got up and fought Daniel and finally got knocked out by Gun Park.\nIn the Hunt For Gun arc, together with Mandeok Bang, Eugene was able to break one of Gun Park's arms at the expense of his knees, showing his strength.\nDue to the descriptions given by Johan, Yuseong may also have the same trait of\nInnate Strength\nas all known members of the Kim Bloodline.\nTrivia\nHe has been shown to use both his right and left hand to eat, indicating that he might be ambidextrous.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nAccording to Eugene, he is \"obsessed with strong guys\".\nHe exhibits childlike behaviors such as wearing dirty clothes, sucking flavoring off his finger, and playing with toys.\nBefore his face was revealed he was commonly referred to as Cap Guy\nGallery\nThe Summit Meeting\nEp. 348\n- Yuseong with phone\nEp. 349\n- Eugene is welcomed as the head of the Workers\nEp. 349\n- Eugene walking to the middle of the room\nEp. 349\n- Warren wondering who he is\nEp. 349\n- Workers surround Johan\nEp. 350\n- Jake & Yuseong watching\nEp. 351\n- Yuseong vs Daniel\nEp. 352\n- Eugene talking to Daniel\nEp. 353\n- Gangseo & Gangnam Union\nJames Lee (Arc)\nEp. 354\n- Jake's flashback 2\nEp. 355\n- Daniel talking to Eugene\nWorkers (2nd Affiliate)\nEp. 373\n- Eugene talking to Daniel\nEp. 374\n- Eugene Flashback\nEp. 375\n- Warren's Flashback\nEp. 385\n- VVIP in car\nEp. 391\n- Workers show up\nEp. 392\n- Workers\nEp. 393\n- VVIP dodges Tom\nEp. 393\n- Tom vs Workers\nThe Hunt for Hostel\nEp. 399\n- Jake's flashback\nEp. 403\n- Eugene arrives with his bodyguards\nFirst Generation King\nEp. 404\n- Eli explaining his business plan\nThe Hunt for Big Deal\nEp. 411\n- Workers\nEp. 411\n- Xiaolong arrives\nEp. 412\n- Lua talks about Workers strength\nEp. 413\n- Eugene sitting\nEp. 414\n- Yuseong playing with toys\nEp. 414\n- Yuseong's face reveal\nEp. 414\n- Yuseong's face\nEp. 414\n- Jake vs Xiaolong & Yuseong\nEp. 415\n- Jack vs Yuseong & Xiaolong\nEp. 416\n- Yuseong & Xiaolong fighting Jake\nEp. 417\n- Jake running at Xiaolong & Yuseong\nEp. 420\n- Yuseong saves Eugene\nEp. 421\n- Yuseong in Flashback (15 Years old)\nEp. 421\n- Johan copies Vasco\nEp. 422\n- Eugene's flashback\nEp. 424\n- Yuseong & Mandeok tired\nEp. 425\n- Eugene's flashback\nEp. 425\n- Daniel using Karate vs Yuseong\nEp. 426\n- Gun flipping everyone over\nEp. 426\n- Gun holding Yuseong\nEp. 429\n- Eugene's flashback\nThe United Four Major Crews\nEp. 430\n- Workers assembled\nEp. 431\n- Daniel talking about Workers power\nFuneral\nEp. 442\n- Mandeok & Yuseong standing guard\nWorkers (1st Affiliate)\nEp. 477\n- Eugene guards ready to fight\nEp. 478\n- Mandeok asking about the truce\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n[1]\nEpisode 421\n\u2191\n2.0\n2.1\nWebtoon, Episode 352\n\u2191\n3.0\n3.1\nWebtoon, Episode 353\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 421: The Hunt For Big Deal (11)"

He is a student in the fashion department of\nJ High School\n, as well as\nMira\n's love interest. He's also\nGongseob Ji's\n- The King of Daegu's disciple.",
        "appearance": "Zack is tall young man with a sturdy, muscular physique. He has slicked back black hair that is cut short on the sides, though his hair had been shaved off as a result of him getting into a fight after promising not to. After this incident, he started wearing a wig\n[\nCitation needed\n]\n. After some chapters that had him in it were introduced, it's most likely he grew his hair back.\nHe has a very good fashion sense, paying attention to his looks when it comes to outshining his peers. He tends to wear gray-scale colored brand clothing. On several occasions, he has worn earrings. Currently, he's wearing Gongseob Ji's clothes and glasses from when he was younger.\nZack has a serious resting face with sharp glaring eyes, which in turn easily intimidates those who look at him. He only occasionally smiles, and he only smiles when he is with Mira or when he is fighting someone of great strength and beating them. He wore a wish bracelet, but it had been taken off years ago.",
        "personality": "Prior to meeting Daniel, Zack was somehow kind at heart despite his poor manners and extremely high imprudence. He had helped both Mira and Johan in many situations regarding their pasts, such as rushing Mira to the hospital\n[\n2\n]\nand saving Johan from bullies, but this kindness was reserved for those that are close to him. As shown in the\nCult Arc\n, Zack was referred to as the strongest of his middle school.\n[\n3\n]\nThis greatly boosted his ego which, when in conjunction with his very short and bad temper, was the reason for most, if not all, his fights and was also the reason for his violence towards the weak.\nAfter meeting Daniel, Zack slowly changed in ways that he isn't very attentive to, although other characters such as\nMira Kim\nhave. Under the circumstances of promising his love interest not to fight, he's had to put a calm face towards those mocking him, and he learned the lives of how his own victims felt. He realized his immature empowerment actions were wrong, and began to stop bother those under him,\n[\n4\n]\neven being shown to be remorseful.\n[\n5\n]\nPeers commented on this behavior, although to Zack it just felt like a bother to waste time picking on others. He matured impressively in a short life span due to his tolerance.\nAlthough he has become somewhat diplomatic, he will try to reason with people that attempt to bother him, preferring to avoid conflict. Regarding his treatment towards others, he will tell people off for unjust actions, but tries to manage it before it resorts to violence. He controls his temper and apologizes, even if nothing is his fault. This is because he doesn't want to make Mira unhappy by having physical altercations with others, and results with others believing he's weak-willed.\nZack has had a strong affection for\nMira Kim\never since they were children. He cares for her deeply and attempts to impress her without making a fool of himself. He gets exceedingly jealous when others flirt with her, he is always considering keeping Mira safe from others due to her bad memories of predators. Although this plays off to be a lap-dog trait, always doing everything Mira desires of him.\nDespite the fact that Zack has developed into a person that truly wants to protect his friends, he is very hard on himself. He continues to blame himself for the fact that\nJiho\nhad attempted murder and that\nJasmine\nran away, although that's not the true underlying case. In addition to this, he had worked his body hard and trained for countless hours every day to achieve his goals of being stronger than Daniel and Johan, wanting to beat their mysterious talents with his pure effort. Zack pursued defeating Daniel,\n[\n6\n]\nhowever Daniel awoke in 'Ultra Instinct,' showing his true capabilities, and Zack continued to look down on himself for not being strong enough to obtain a victory.\n[\n7\n]\nAfter resuming training, Zack has shown himself to in complete subscription to boxing as not only a fighting style but fighting philosophy. The latter trait expressed with him taking 1-minute breaks after 3-minute intervals during his latest fight with Daniel Park (emulating the format of real boxing matches). In addition, he staunchly takes pride in his status as a boxer, calling himself a \"professional\" who would not engage in street fights. Despite that, he states that if he is to engage in street fights he would do so not as a boxer aiming to win but as someone aiming to kill.\nHowever, due to a bevy of defeats at the hands of Johan, Daniel Park, Mandeok, among others, Zack has shown a keen neuroticism concerning winning fights. This has led him to adopt dirty boxing as his trump card when pressed against stronger opponents, something which he loathes due to his pride as a professional. As such, when in this state of neuroticism, Zack acts in an exaggeratedly morose and depressed manner whilst maintaining his aggression - verbally lamenting his inability to win without resorting to dirty boxing.\nAfter not being able to get a single win against anyone in the 2nd Affiliate, even with dirty boxing, he was at a loss. He lamented about how everyone else around him was getting stronger and he seemed incapable of being so, frustrated to the point he didn't have any tears to cry about it anymore. His pity party was cut short when Cho Ma and Gong Ji found him sulking. After criticizing him for fighting, they told him to go to Daegu if he wanted to go continue ruining his life by getting stronger. There he found Gongseob Ji, a 1st Generation King who once ruled over Daegu. While hesitating at first to train him, Zack managed to touch Gongseob's heartstrings and began to learn iron boxing. While physically training him was part of it, the most important thing Gongseob trained Zack was mentally. In a month, Zack became a different person, No longer was he a guy quick to anger or someone filled with neuroticism, going down the path of self-loathing would leave him as a bird trapped in a cage unable to fly. He would only become stronger once he took pride in himself and everything he learned, and Zack Lee achieved it with flying colors.\nHe became someone who believes in himself and his abilities, now trying to block out any form of negative thoughts not cloud his judgment, and has even picked up the habit of crying out to the Buddha as a means of calming himself. After everything he's been through, Zack Lee has finally become a bird able to fly, now confident with the person he has became and no longer burdened with his shortcomings.\nZack in the current chapters apparently seems more relaxed in terms of humor, seen when he was sarcastic with\nJohan Seong\n, Calling him a crybaby after he was saddened by what happened to him by his mother. This shows that Zack seems to have more of a sense of humor, since in previous chapters, He always had a serious face, but now it's different, with him making expressions and mocking in the same way as his master,\nGongseob Ji",
        "history": "Zack comes from a rich family,referring to $500 as pocket change.\n[\n8\n]\nDuring the early parts of the story he was seen spending his money on top-notch clothing to impress Mira.\n[\n9\n]\nZack has known and had a crush on\nMira\nsince childhood. He used to accompany her on various extracurricular activities, not out of his own interest but rather to spend more time with her. Mira was the one who introduced Zack to the world of boxing being one of the activities she was attending at the time.\nAt some point, he befriended Johan, who was going to the same church he did when they were young. Zack wasn't aware of Johan's fighting potential until he saw him copying one of his boxing moves.\n[\n10\n]\nZack knew Johan had feelings for Mira, and it was part of the wedge that drove the two of them apart.\nHaving once enjoyed the bullying of the weak, Zack has since changed due to the influence of Mira, whom he is in love with, and is now on good terms with both sides of Daniel Park.",
        "fighting_prowess": "See article:\nIron Boxing\nZack is a very capable fighter who can hold his own against most of his peers in school and was placed in the same caliber as Vasco and Daniel. Unlike\nVasco\nor Daniel, Zack had neglected his training for quite some time as he was confident that his fighting ability was enough to hold his own against any opponent at the start of the series. His pride in his abilities has since been humbled by the staggering number of formidable fighters around him who possess even more talent than him. Once realizing he's no longer able to fully protect Mira, he has decided to resume training with a mindset that his hard work would surpass his enemy's and friend's talents.\n[\n11\n]\nZack is a proficient out-boxer, having trained since childhood and is considered a formidable opponent by his peers due to his outstanding talent earning him achievements in numerous competitions. His type of fighting style is a hit and run outboxer.\n[\n12\n]\nZack's out-boxing style is typical, relying heavily on speed to deliver quick combinations utilizing straight punches with little in the way of body blows. This fighting style effectively placing Zack in a position to attack and denying his opponents counterattack. When pressed, Zack will normally use his footwork and head movement to evade.\nWhen in a situation in which blocking is absolutely necessary, Zack has demonstrated an impressive understanding and application of the Philly Shell, a style popularized by Floyd Mayweather Jr. This style is characterized by the usage of the shoulder roll, resulting in opponent's punches being deflected and diffused off of the user's round shoulder.\nOnly a handful of fighters can actually keep up with Zack and dodge his punches such as Daniel Park and Johan. As such, Zack's speed has been used as a benchmark for other fighters. If the said opponent is on par with or surpasses Zack's speed, they are considered threats not to be taken lightly which is a further testament to the danger Zack's speed possesses.\nHowever, as a result of Zack's reliance on his speed, fighters that equal or surpass found themselves in a position much more favorable to victory.\nHowever, Zack is not set in his style, having created counters to techniques used against him such as being able to respond to Daniel's utilization of a body blow in Zack's later fight with Logan Lee. Beyond skill, Zack has also demonstrated vast improvements to himself after resuming training, giving up his pride in exchange for grit and determination. On a mental level, this has given Zack greater endurance and resolve to see his strategies through such as enduring Daniel Park's attacks to formulate his own counterattacks. On a physical level, this has resulted in Zack becoming immensely more powerful, stunning Johan and Daniel in a past fight with narration stating that he has the style and tendencies of an out-boxer but the power of a in-fighter.\nHowever, despite Zack's continual efforts to become stronger now, he held an inclination to not train in other styles, sticking only to boxing. Even when pressed to train in a mixed martial arts setting, he refused, and continued with boxing, despite his own coach's admission that Zack has essentially mastered all of boxing's techniques with any further advancement coming in the form of physical training. However, as of Chapter 352, Zack has begun to \"discard his pride\" and now utilizes dirty boxing, having used head-butts and pivot blows (spinning backfists). This could lead into a transition to other forms of martial arts. Recently, he enjoyed using chains as a weapon.\nHe loses confidence due to repeated defeats, falls into a state of self-loathing and his body starts \"burning up.\" This is called heat mode. It occurs when feeling self-hatred for not being able to achieve something. The body becomes really hot to the point where your heart is about to burst, causing you to have an awakening in strength.\nLater on, he is trains under Gongseop Ji, a king from the first generation whose fighting style consists of being able deal with and dish out heavy damage. This is shown by him being able to not only take hits, but also deal overwhelming damage to Mandeok Bang, who had previously been able to one-shot Zack. Zack also further improved his outboxer style, with intense training resulting with his movements being far quicker than before.\nAfter his training is finished he teams up with Daniel and Vasco to fight against the Workers. Eventually, after the battle is finished Zack joins the\nAllied\ncrew. During the 1 st affiliate Arc Zack fought Gen 0 fighter Gwang Yu on equal footing and defeated him ,such that he recognized Zack to be the true Iron Boxer ,he also fought a drugged Johan Seong  on equal footing defeating him, tanking every hit and countering with equal force, he also developed the Gongseob Ji Counter during this fight. During Hunt for Gun Park arc he with other memembers stalled the Yamazaki leader for a long time gaining his praise. By the time of Busan Arc he become so strong that he defeated the succesors of Busan crew and was fighting\nJangyeon Na (King of Incheon)\non equal footing with Allied crew.\nQuotes\nTrivia\nWhenever Zack Lee is drunk, he becomes a weak, weeping face, even hugging and kissing Daniel.\n[\n13\n]\nZack currently possesses 2 masteries- endurance and speed, much like his master.\nSome have said that an appearance of Jin Sung resembles the famous tattoo maker, Kiji (named after Instagram: Kijikush).\nZack's English name is the same as Zack Lee, an Indonesian born British boxer and actor.\n[\n14\n]\nOne of the supporting characters, Cho Ma (student of the 2nd Fashion Department), resembles the face of Jin Sung. The difference between the two is his long curly hair, while Zack keeps his fringe of hair gelled back.\nHe was an atheist\n[\n12\n]\nhowever, after he met\nGongseob Ji\n, He was \"converted\" to buddhism.\nIn Chapter 27 of \"My Life as a Loser\" (another series by Park Taejun), a boxing genius named Gu Sangmin is said to be the 3rd best in middle school boxing competition. Zack Lee (2nd) and Johan Seong (1st) are the two who he could not beat.\nZack possesses phasmaphobia (the irrational fear of poltergeists, ghosts, and other similar creatures).\n[\n15\n]\nIn episode 14 of webtoon he was able to get the highest score in the arcade punching bag which was 892, but it was shortly beaten by Vasco with a score of 910.\nIn chapter 428,\nJames Lee\nmentions that Zack must improve his breathing control to emulate\nGongseob Ji\n.\nReferences\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 94\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 133\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 19\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 30\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 273\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 274\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 215: Jacedaichi Case Files (01)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 15\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 136: Cult (05)\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 131: First Love (Conclusion)\n\u2191\n12.0\n12.1\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 125\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nEpisode 12\n\u2191\nZack Lee\non\nWikipedia\n\u2191\nLookism,\nChapter 96"

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nExposition\nChapter 2\nThe protagonist, Daniel, first meets Jin Sung on the streets after Daniel, in his original body, had just gotten a haircut. Daniel thought his haircut had made him very handsome, but nobody else seemed to think so. When Daniel finds Mijin looking at him, he thinks that she is interested in him, so he smiles at her. Jin Sung sees Daniel smile at Mijin and thinks he's propositioning her. He confronts Daniel, and may have gotten into a fight if Mijin had not steered him away, telling him not to act aggressively in public. While walking away, Mijin smiles apologetically at Daniel for Jin Sung's behaviour. However, Daniel takes the smile for flirting and asks Mijin and Jin Sung out for coffee. Unable to keep his anger under control, Jin Sung punches Daniel in the face while bystanders took pictures and uploaded them online.\nChapter 4\nThe first day of school, Daniel realizes that his seat is right next to Jin Sung's. When Ha Neul begins flirting with Daniel, Jin Sung tells her to stop flirting because it was annoying.\nWhen Jin Sung sees Mijin staring at Daniel, he begins to hate Daniel for being handsome because he thinks that Mijin likes Daniel.\nChapter 5\nWhen Jin Sung goes to the convenience store where Daniel works at night, he is upset because he thinks Mijin is attracted to Daniel in his new body. He tries to extort free alcohol and cigarettes from Daniel despite the fact that he and his friends were all underage.\nIt was also revealed that Chapter 2 was Jin Sung's date with Mijin. Moreover, Jin Sung had asked Mijin out, but she had refused.\nJin Sung was so upset by all this that he beats Daniel up. In order to ensure that Daniel doesn't say anything, they take pictures of him with his pants down.\nThe next day, Daniel in his new body walk in on Jin Sung, his friends from last night, and Ha Neul talking about the way Jin Sung had beat him up the night before. Jin Sung's friend was showing off the picture he had taken of Daniel with his pants down. Ha Neul waves at Daniel, telling him that Jin Sung's friend had something fun to show them. Daniel gets mad because they were making fun of him.\nChapter 6\nWhen Jin Sung's friends show off the picture of Daniel and compliment Jin Sung's speed, Jin Sung tells them that he isn't proud of hitting Daniel even though he actually wants them to speak up louder so Mijin would hear. He thinks that Mijin would think he is cool for being very strong. Instead, Mijin says that he hates the way Jin Sung fights all the time. She explains that in Chapter 2 Jin Sung had invited her to the movies only to get into a fight (with Daniel). The girl chatting with Mijin tells her that Jin Sung used to be a rising boxer in middle school.\nJin Sung brags about his fighting expertise by explaining that he shouldn't have hit Daniel with a straight punch but instead with a jab.\nHe and his friends then laugh that Daniel's mother must also be \"a pig,\" and Mijin thinks they are disgusting.\nOne of Jin Sung's friends then says that he will take both Daniel in his original body and his mother. He goes on to say that Daniel's mother would not have been happy when she gave birth to him and that, if he were her, he would have had an abortion.\nDaniel realizes that his mother was being insulted because of him and gets up to tell Jin Sung and his friends that they have gone too far. With this, Jae Yeol, friends of Jin Sung, Mijin and Ha Neul seem surprised, while Jin Sung is outraged because Daniel made a fool in front of Mijin.\nJin Sung then takes a fight with Daniel, raising his own table and telling Daniel to get up.\nAutumn Boot Camp Arc\nDaniel sits next to Jin Sung on the bus to the camp.\nWhen in the camp, after the talent show, Jin Sung and Daniel are invited by Hyun Do to drink with him and several girls from the Department of Beauty. Jin Sung makes an excuse to leave, and Daniel follows. Jin Sung takes Daniel to Mijin's room where they drink with Mijin, Ha Neul, Ji Ho and another girl. Because they all fainted after being drunk, except for Mira, who did not drink a drop, they were not caught by the camp counselors.\nLater, when Mijin was nowhere to be found, Jin Sung ran to find her, alerting Daniel that something was wrong. Jin Sung finds Mijin in a shed, crying and bleeding, trying to keep\nZeus\n, the camp instructor who was trying to untie her pants, out of it. Infuriated, Jin Sung attacks him, only for Zeus to seize him. Jin Sung realizes belatedly that Zeus knows Muay Thai, and Zeus is able to break his ribs and both arms. Zeus thinks he has won, but Won Bin suddenly grabs Zeus's leg. Won Bin, unable to stand, crawled to stop Zeus. Jin Sung soca Zeus in the face, despite his broken arms. When Daniel encounters Jin Sung and Mijin, they find Jin Sung out of his mind, repeatedly punching Zeus in the face.\nAs Zeus is being taken away by the police, viewers comment that he looks too handsome to be a sex offender and speculates on this to be a false accusation. Meanwhile, they laugh at the fact that Won Bin looks more like the perpetrator than the hero. Jin Sung, sitting in the back of an ambulance, confronts the onlookers, telling them to care about their mouths. He bows to Wo Bin, thanking him for protecting him and Mijin. When Mijin asks if Jin Sung is well, Jin Sung energetically replies that he is totally fine and tells her to stay with the police. As soon as Mijin leaves, he collapses. Jin Sung was so injured that it took two months to recover, and Mijin was taken to take apples in the hospital bed and thanked him for saving her.\nEun Tae says he came because he wanted to make people stop saying he's dumb. Jin Sung, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Eun Tae's superstitious ideas, making fun of Eun Tae, saying that ghosts do not really exist. Bum Jae tells him that if he is not afraid, he should sign his name on the glass frame around the picture.\nWhen Jin Sung arrives at the warehouse, he realizes that the lights can not be lit. He then rushes to a glass panel, only to see the portrait of the ghost woman staring maliciously at him, bloodshot eyes wide open. Jin Sung hastily signs his name on glass and skedaddles. As he runs back into the classroom, he cries like a baby, just in case.\nIn the classroom, Bum Jae is incredulous that Jin Sung signed his name on the portrait. He wants to take an immediate look at Eun Tae, but Eun Tae, scared, tells him to go tomorrow.\nThe next morning, the school is agitated with the news that Jin Sung has signed his name on the portrait, and they all head to the storage room to see if it's true.\nWhen they get there, they realize that Jin Sung's signature is not in the glass frame outside the picture, but in the windowpane. Jin Sung realizes that the lady's eyes of the picture are closed and that he actually saw the ghost the night before. He faints and wet his pants.\nIn the end, he explains that if he had hallucinated due to fear or actually seen a ghost, the important thing was that Mijin saw him wet his pants.\nJay's Wallet\nWhen Jae Yeol rushes to the seat of Daniel to teach him a problem, Jin Sung can be seen sleeping next to Daniel in the classroom.\nTroubled Transfer\nHe is seen by\nJay-gal Song\nwith Mira in the lunchroom. Jay-gal pretends to accidentally bump into him, making food from his lunch tray hit Logan Lee. When Zack apologizes and brushes the food off, Logan glares at him. Zack responds by apologizing submissively, much to the anger of Jay-gal. Zack and Mira leave without getting into a fight.\nThey take a seat and Mira prays, with Zack pretending to pray to please her. However, in the middle of Mira's prayer, Logan dumps food on Mira's head on purpose.\n[\n1\n]\nJay-gal giddily thinks that Zack is going to get angry at Logan, but Zack instead takes a napkin and wipes the food off Mira, asking if she's okay. He asks a girl to take Mira to wash off in the bathroom. Logan mistakenly thinks that Zack is just an idiot. When Mira leaves, Zack suddenly punches Logan in the face, catching him off guard.\nJay-gal thinks that Logan is going to beat Zack, but Zack punches Logan and he is surprised by Zack's speed. Logan wipes the blood off his nose and Zack says he is surprised by Logan's defense. Zack says he can deal with someone bothering him, but not Mira.\nZack goes in to kick him when Logan counters with a \"body blow\" which Zack blocks with his arms. In his head, he worries that his arms are broken again. Logan is shocked that his punch was blocked, but quickly recovers. He tackles Zack into the floor and he screams, which makes Vasco overhear the fight.\n[\n2\n]\nLogan pours food onto him. Zack tries to get up, but he can't because he hadn't worked out in a while. He said that he wouldn't regret it, yet he did. He is unable to get off the ground. A wet-haired Mira steps between him and Logan. Logan pulls her hair, which makes Zack extremely angry and he punches Logan in the nose. He tells Mira to dry her hair or else she'd get a cold and Mira is touched by his concern.\nVasco grabs him Logan by the shoulder to try and stop the fight, but Zack tells him not to interfere. At that moment, Jin Vin steps through the door and wants to rechallenge Logan. The three want to challenge Logan to fight.\n[\n3\n]\nCult Arc\nYoung Johan, Mira, and Zack are in church and they pray to God. Zack prays that he would get together with Mira. Someone holds out a basket for an offering and Zack asks if giving more money would mean better things, and Johan mysteriously tells him not necessarily. Zack then shoves the money back in his pocket, saying that he was saving the money for the arcade anyways.\nThe young trio and in a neighborhood getting haircuts, and Zack says that the neighborhood was crappy. Zack aggressively asks Yohan's mom if she was doing his hair correctly, and Mira angrily scolds him.\nThe three get wish bracelets, and Zack wishes to marry Mira in the future.\nAt 15 years old, Zack saves Johan from a group of bullies, but Johan runs away and refuses to acknowledge that he knows Zack. Mira sees them, but doesn't talk to Zack until after Johan runs away.\n[\n4\n]\nReferences\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 124\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 125\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 126\n\u2191\nWebtoon,\nChapter 132"

        "appearance": "Though it has never been explicitly said throughout the Manhwa, Zoe is considered to be a very beautiful young lady. She is rather tall, clocking in at 5'8, taller than most characters who suffered the Lookism such as Daniel. She has a curvy figure, with her biggest assist being her noticeable bust. She has shoulder-length black hair curls up on her shoulders while sporting bangs, in the anime it's just kept as straight black hair, clear fair skin, and brown eyes as seen in the anime.\nShe is mainly shown wearing the standard J high female uniform without the tan-colored vest. Outside of school, she is seen wearing a variety of fashionable outfits, they are never consistent and are usually one-off appearances, but her most notable non-school outfit is the one she wears while visiting Little Daniel at his part-time job at the start of the series. Consisting of a black shirt covered with a gray zip-up sweater, blue sweat shorts, and white socks with pink-colored shoes, it's the design they use for the mobile game.",
        "personality": "She initially came off as a shallow person. At school she was known to be a flirt, trying to get with guys based on their looks alone. She immediately attempted to flirt with Big\nDaniel Park\nand fell in love with him just because of his perfect looks. The same logic can be applied in reverse, she judges people due to their unconventional appearances rather than looking at the content of their character.\nHowever, after being saved from a stalker by Daniel in his original body, even after how she treated him, She begins to have a crush on Daniel's original body, this time not because of his appearance but for the content of his character. It was shown that she was genuinely a good person, as seen how protective of those close to her, as seen by the struggles she went through at the hands of Logan Lee to protect small Daniel, but had her morals in the wrong places. After this in-counter with Little Daniel, she continuously has shown to be kind to everyone, including strangers, even when it isn't beneficial to her, trying to show others the kindness Daniel showed her that day. This is shown when she puts a band-aid on\nLogan Lee\nwhen she gives\nStalker Girl\na hot pack.\nQuotes\nTrivia\nZoe's japanese name name\nMirei\nmeans \"beautiful\" (\u7f8e) (\nmi\n) and \"wise\" (\u601c) (\nrei\n). Mirei's surname\nKagawa\nmeans \"fragrance, fragrant\" (\u9999) (\nka\n) and \"river, stream\" (\u5ddd) (\nkawa\n/\ngawa\n).\nZoe is a fan of\nBTS\n, as shown in Chapter 39 when she is excited that they had replied to one of her comments.\nZoe's dream is to gain 10 million subscribers online. She has lessened her activity online after she was stalked, but is still determined to reach her goal even after the incident.\nZoe has the highest score in maths for the fashion department.\nAfter the stalker incident Zoe is often shown internally struggling with who she likes most (Big Daniel and Small Daniel).\nReferences\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile\n\u2191\nListed in the Japanese Profile"

        "relationships": "Image Gallery\nLove Interests\nDaniel Park\nZoe realizing Daniels height growth\nZoe first met Daniel in his new body. Being the first person to ever flirt with Daniel, she initially came off as a shallow person, only pressurizing him for his looks, a practice she would always do every time she sees a good-looking guy. The same logic applied to his original body, she judged and didn't respect him due to his unconventional appearance. However, after being saved from a stalker by Daniel in his original body, even after how she treated him, she realizes that she shouldn't just like someone for their looks. She begins to have a crush on Daniel's original body, this time not because of his appearance but for the content of his character. She would try to repay the kindness he showed him, whether that be keeping him company convenience store late at night or checking up on him by asking Big Daniel how Little Daniel was doing or just asking him things about him to know more about him. Her nickname for his old body is \"Piggy\", once a way to insult him, became a name she would use rather affectionately towards him. While Daniel was taken aback by this change of attitude, he would soon warm up to her and the two would become close friends, something he would hold dearly. He was so comfortable with her that she was the only person he willingly shared his past of being bullied and an outcast, something he claimed he couldn't be honest with his friends due to the fear of losing them if they found out and when Logan came back into his life, Daniel was willing to leave everything behind if it meant that Logan could no longer take advantage of him to get closer to her.\nDaniel waring Zoe of accepting free Plastic Surgery from the First Affiliate\nZoe cried that day, she realized that almost everyone in his life (including her) treated him horribly because of his appearance, and even if it was in a misguided effort to do so, he would do anything to protect her. Zoe didn't want Daniel to suffer anymore, and to protect him, she confronted Logan. Logan took advantage of this desperation and forced her into a contract, they would go on six dates to try and make her fall in love with him and if didn't work, he would leave both of them alone. However, he didn't make it easy, regularly abusing her physically and emotionally with threats of killing Daniel if she did not comply with his wishes. Zoe felt trapped in a box, a box she concluded that Daniel was in after all his years of bullying, but it didn't matter to her. No matter how many times she was talked bad about, no more how many times she was hit, no matter how many times she cried, it will all be worth it if it meant that Daniel could just sit back and not suffer anymore. So when she found Daniel at her doorstep with the words \"You're finally looking at me.\" with nothing but a smile on his face after beating Logan. She hugged him, and to see that the struggles she went through to protect Daniel paid off, she cried tears of relief and happiness.\nDespite it still being unconfirmed whether or not Daniel shares the same feelings she does, it's undeniable the two of them are the closest of friends. Whether it be Daniel literary storming the First Affiliate to save Zoe from a botched plastic surgery to Zoe putting her body and feelings on the line to protect Daniel from his bullies the smaller thing like Daniel denouncing the rumors of Zoe being considered 'easy' to get with to Zoe supporting and celebrating Daniels weight loss. Both have mutual respect and deeply care for each other well being.\nLogan Lee\nZoe is Logan's ex-girlfriend. She dated him out of fear that he would hurt Daniel if she refused,\u00a0but was spared when Daniel fought Logan for her freedom.\u00a0She hates Logan due to his\u00a0terrible personality. Despite this Logan still likes her and carries\u00a0a band-aid that she gave him long ago.\nFriends\nZack Lee\nZack Lee used to see Zoe as a flirt,\n[\n1\n]\nbut after Daniel becomes friends with both of them, they get along.\nMira Kim\nZoe is good friends with Mira, to Zack's annoyance.\nCrystal Choi\nZoe is friends with Crystal, despite her ill-will for her romantic interest towards Daniel. She wished Crystal well regarding her relationship with Daniel when she was dating Logan.\nZoe started liking Crystal in her old body, Crystal saved her and Zoe's friends from girls in Potato High. Zoe also developed a crush on Crystal's second body in the Wuthering J high school\n[\n1\n]\narc.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0\n1.1\nWebtoon,\nChapter 251"
