Summary
Daniel tells Vasco that the man is his superior and Vasco apologizes. The manager asks Vasco if he wants piercings like Duke and he gets triggered and beats him. The higher ups at PTJ do not report the incident because they don't want it getting out.
Aru meets with the board at PTJ and they are discussing her new film. She is mad that DG won't pay attention to her compared to the other men. DG prepares to leave early for a meeting but they ask him to stay. He invites Crystal over to PTJ so he can talk to her, and the men fawn over Crystal. They even ask her to take Aru's place.
Aru is jealous of how DG treats Crystal with kindness and favors her. She cries to her boyfriend and makes plans for revenge.
