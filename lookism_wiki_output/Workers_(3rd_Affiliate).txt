Synopsis
Episode 330
Jake
calls
Jerry
and
Lineman
into Hotel Vivi, all three of them disguised with tracksuits.
Mandeok
tells
Eugene
about this and asks if this means they are at war with
Big Deal
now. Eugene says it is not war since there are only three men, but that he won’t sit back and do nothing.
Jake and the team go to
Old Face
who is tied in the bathroom, and he tells them that the captives are on the top floor. To get there, they will need to take a badge from one of the four executives of the
Workers
third affiliate: Hwang Ho, Taegon Wi, Sowol Jin and Huseong Ha.
Daniel
is captured in a tub when he wakes up. The rich kids are screaming for him to be murdered, and
Viv
i concocts a stronger version of hydrochloric acid to melt him with.
Jake Kim calls
Zack Lee
and tells him that the Workers have Daniel, and Zack calls
Vasco
and
Eli
to Hotel Vivi. Hwang Ho is angry that he lost to Vasco, and is preparing to crush him.
Samuel Seo
gets a call from the Workers allowing him to dispatch to the third affiliate.
Zack arrives on a bicycle and finds the other two waiting for them, but the three of them are blocked by
Johan Seong
. He refuses to move since
Xiaolong
promised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job.
Episode 331
The suited up worker is about to spill acid on Daniel when he trips and spills it on the ground. The bodyguards ask what he is doing and he bodies them while Daniel uses Sophia's bone squeeze escape technique to run out of the room. The worker removes his mask and reveals that he is Doo Lee, and he wanted to repay Daniel for the troubles he gave him at the convenience store.
Zack, Vasco and Eli are fighting Johan and they are all having a difficult time. The two of them grab Johan's legs and tell Eli to go ahead without them. When he disappears inside, Zack tells Vasco that he should go as well to help save people, although he is not sure if he can beat Johan.
Xiaolong tells a hotel couple to stay inside since there is a disturbance in the hotel. He is surprised that Daniel turned out to be one of the intruders, and he wonders if there are others working with him. Huseong hits Daniel out from the bathroom and prepares to kill him. Lineman steps out from his hiding place and tells Huseong to leave Daniel alone since he's just a kid. He tells Daniel to run and that he'll be fine, since he is a member of Big Deal, despite being afraid himself.
Eli Jang walks through the kitchen when he is attacked by Taegon Wi. He draws his weapon, but then realizes he brought Yenna's toy wand instead of his baton.
Episode 332
Xiaolong is informed about the intruders, who are fighting executives. He tells the guard to tell the executives they can kill any intruder. He locks Vivi in her room and guards the outside.
Taegon Wi grew up without a family in China. He was targeted by kidnappers as a kid, and he did whatever he could to survive. When he became older he was approached by Xiaolong who offered him a position. Although he has been in Korea for some time, he hasn’t found any opponents as strong as those in China.
Taegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli’s baton away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.
Lineman is still standing after taking a beating from Huseong. Huseong asks why his tattoos aren’t colored in, because it looks amateur. Lineman says he can’t color them because Jake called him Lineman. Huseong decides to end things when Jerry comes out of the bathroom. Lineman asks Jerry if his act was worthy of Big Deal before passing out.
Episode 333
Huseong Ha was abandoned at a zoo when he was a newborn. A male gorilla decided to raise him, and he treated it like his mother. The authorities took Huseong out and he entered society, but he was always curious about why humans are weak. He joined the army and later founded the Gorilla gang. Later on, his gang was sold to the Bicheon gang by the authorities. Xiaolong approached him at dinner and asked him to help protect someone.
Huseong asks Jerry if he is trying so hard because Jake is watching him. Jake offers to get the badge for Jerry but he tells Jake to take Lineman and Daniel and leave. Once they are gone, Jerry punches Huseong into the wall, and his head breaks a hole into it. Huseong realizes Jerry was hiding his strength to not outshine Jake. Lineman returns and sees the wreckage, and Jerry tells him not to reveal that he is stronger than Jake. Vasco comes across Hwang Ho and uses Brekdak’s 7th forbidden move, dough kneading. Hwang sees it coming and blocks the attack.
Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he’s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn’t need help, since Johan is reliable enough. Samuel offers to help out if Xiaolong barks like a dog.
Episode 334
Jake takes Daniel and Tiktaktok girl to a room so they can pretend to be guests, warning them not to leave. Daniel asks the girl to go to sleep, and he tries to turn into his other body but it won’t wake up. Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.
The disfigured men attack Eli and he is surprised how little they care about being damaged. They even injure each other trying to kill him. Elsewhere, Vasco tries to get the badge from Hwang but the henchmen grab him. They are doused with gasoline, and they light a match while holding Vasco. The three musketeers are climbing the elevator when they arrive at a floor filled with the disfigured henchmen. They are even on top of the elevator.
Samuel explains that during the Great Chinese Fire, 103 children were burned. Xiaolong took them in and turned them into warriors to protect Vivi. They are part of the Bicheon gang (Bi meaning queen, Cheon meaning sky and heaven). Samuel doesn’t think they are as strong as Big Deal however. Jake, Jerry and Lineman mow down the men and arrive at Vivi’s room.
Episode 335
Vasco managed to avoid being burned, and the fire alarms have been turned on. In the wet, Vasco, Eli and Big Deal try to fend off the Bicheon gang, but they keep rising back up. Jerry grabs Lineman by the head and clears a path for Jake. Lineman pulls down a grate to block the horde.
The three of them face Xiaolong. Vivi breaks open the door and yells at Xiaolong for locking her inside, but he tells her to stay there and closes the door again, locking it with his spear. He tells Jake he will have to kill him if he wants to enter the door. Jake tells Xiaolong he isn’t protecting Vivi simply out of loyalty, and the flashback begins.
Xiaolong was among 108 unregistered Chinese children. He participated in a brutal match where he had to slaughter his fellow brothers in order to be recognized by Vivi’s father. He took him in as a guard to watch over Vivi. Xiaolong throws away Lineman and knocks Jerry into the ground.
Xiaolong says that Big Deal have already failed since their reinforcements are coming (Johan). Johan makes his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he’s working with the third affiliate when they’re responsible for the Punsang cult.
Episode 336
Sowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. Jerry is fighting Xiaolong and he wishes to have seen his weapon, and Xiaolong says it wouldn’t make a difference. He remembers killing his mutinous brothers and sisters when they decided to rise against Vivi. He trained hard to be able to protect Vivi with or without a weapon. Jake steps in to continue the fight for Jerry, who is out cold.
Episode 337
Xiaolong recalls when he sent Taegon Wi to monitor Jake Kim, going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well. He is shocked to see how powerful Jake was. Gun hears people comparing him to Xiaolong and says he would have to fight him in order to see how strong he truly is.
Jake tells Xiaolong that he’s going to take Vivi to get information about the Workers No.8, Sinu Han. Jake runs towards Vivi’s room and Xiaolong races after him. Jake throws the spear at Xiaolong, and when he’s dodging he grabs his head and slams him into the ground. With Xialong incapacitated, he walks to Vivi’s door.
Xiaolong recalls being promoted to Cheon No.1 by the current master Jiou Jeon. He is taught Cheon Hohuigong, a martial art that is passed down to the Cheon guards. It’s about making the body into a weapon. Xiaolong declines the offer to protect the chairman because he wants to protect Vivi. Gun continues his narration by saying he would have had to fight Xiaolong because he doesn’t know how he would fare against his martial art. In present day Xiaolong rises again to fight.
Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.
Episode 338
Xiaolong starts using his broken arm as a whip. When Xiaolong dodges his fingers he slashes him in the face with his hair, which is concealing blades.
Hwang Ho recalls meeting with his peers: Huseong Ha of Gorilla gang, King Gon Taegon Wi, Hongwol Sowol Jin and Hwang Ho. Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest by fighting, and Hwang decided to challenge him. When Hwang asked why they were fighting, Taegon said because he is obviously the strongest of the four.
Hwang Ho decides he will go full force for Vasco, and Vasco warns him that people die from Brekdak’s five most powerful skills. They prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away. Daniel starts climbing outside the hotel so he can get to the penthouse.
Eli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan says to give the badge or else he will kill him.
Episode 339
Gun is asked how strong Eli is compared to the others. He says Eli could have been strong if he continued fighting, but he took a three year break. Without doing any training in that time, the others would have surely surpassed him. However, Eli has been doing some training. When Tom Lee found out Eli had a daughter, he kidnapped her. He kept her away from Eli until Eli regained his animal instincts: namely, being sneaky with stronger opponents. In one month he managed to win back Yenna from Tom.
Johan throws Eli’s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna’s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.
Jerry and Lineman wake up and are shocked to see Jake scarred from his fight. Jake tells Xiaolong he didn’t want to get serious, because he was losing his mind thinking about revenge. He’s willing to drop the facade for Xiaolong and pretend that he is Gun.
Episode 340
The juvenile detention guards are chatting about their worst inmates when one of them brings up Gun Park. He used to fight the most violent inmates every day, staining the walls with their blood. Jake Kim surpassed him though, making the bloodstains even higher.
Xiaolong gets beat into another flashback. He remembers Vivi giving him his name Xiaolong, meaning “Little Dragon”. Vivi wanted to befriend Xiaolong, but he never had time for her because he didn’t want to indulge in her feelings. She even confessed to him but he apologized and said he didn’t deserve her. Xiaolong eventually became a eunuch so he could protect Vivi without her father’s suspicion.
Jake breaks Xiaolong’s two arms, and he tries to attack with his mouth. Jake grabs hold of Xiaolong and warns him that if he continues, he may never walk again. Xiaolong says he never intended to walk away from this battle, and Jake breaks his legs.
Jake opens the door for Vivi and tells her they are leaving. Vivi says that she isn’t leaving without Xiaolong and she sees him broken on the ground. Xiaolong crawls to Vivi and she runs to embrace him. Vivi and Xiaolong cry together, and he barks like a dog. Samuel hears him and smirks.
Episode 341
Daniel gets to the penthouse and releases the tied up influencers. They tell him there’s one more guy locked in another room, and he goes to investigate.
Xiaolong tells Samuel he will do whatever he wants if he protects Vivi. Samuel says he doesn’t want to. He was ordered by Eugene to help him break up the third affiliate’s current leadership, since they’re causing trouble. He wanted to make use of Vivi’s relationship with her father, but the leader of T Company refused to do business with them. If Samuel can bring Vivi to Eugene, he will be able to run the third affiliate.
Samuel mocks Xiaolong and tells Jake they are allies now. Jake asks what he is going to do with Vivi, because he needs her to tell him where Sinu is. Samuel says he will tell him about Sinu later but Jake doesn’t trust him, and they start fighting. As they are fighting, Daniel is thrown out between them. He warns them to run. The lights start flickering and influencers run away screaming. Daniel’s second body appears in ultra instinct form.
Episode 342
Daniel tries to understand why his second body is moving on its own. Samuel and Jake try to attack UI Daniel, but they aren’t doing damage. Jake is ashamed of fighting double, but at the moment all he can think of is survival. Jerry offers to help in spite of his fear. He gathers all his strength into one punch, but Daniel uses the punch to power his own kick. Jake takes the shot and is knocked into a building.
Samuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.
Episode 343
Johan’s past enemies and friends hype up how powerful he is as he’s fighting Daniel’s UI form. Samuel and Jake watch the two of them fight. UI Daniel uses the kyokushin and a triple kick on Johan, followed by systema and capoeira.While Johan is simply copying moves, Daniel has mastered them. Johan keeps fighting in hopes that he can copy Daniel’s moves and gain some experience for fighting Gun. He is eventually overpowered. Daniel is about to step on him when Goo arrives, carrying Xiaolong’s spear. He takes in the situation and then gets serious with Daniel.
Episode 344
Goo pretends he isn’t interested in fighting Daniel before slicing at him with the spear. Daniel dodges it and the two of them begin fighting. Goo keeps on rambling and looking for openings, but Daniel isn’t letting up. Daniel breaks his weapon and Goo becomes serious for once.
Logan Lee arrives in the elevator to see Goo lying on the ground, bloodied and with a broken arm. Daniel is unconscious on the ground. Goo complains to Logan that he had to use
batto
, and Goo corrects him that he used Korean kendo instead.
Logan picks up Vivi and Xiaolong to take with him. Daniel tells him to leave them there or he’ll kill him. Daniel remembers telling Sophia that the other reason he wanted to become strong was so he could beat Logan Lee, since he can also copy moves.
Episode 345
Goo knocks out Logan and tells him to not cause any trouble. They have a stare down and Logan leaves. Jake tells Goo he can’t take Vivi and Xiaolong. Goo asks if he can put a pause on his revenge scheme since there will be a war soon. He asks Jake to let him go just this once, and Jake begrudgingly obliges.
Vasco wakes up and is disappointed in his loss, vowing to be the main character next time. Zack is also depressed from his loss, and the fact that he cannot help his friend. He is filled with grief and his chest starts feeling hot. Samuel walks to Jake and asks if he still wants information from Vivi. Jake says Goo already left, but Samuel mentions there’s a basement in Club Vivi that only the executives can go to. He says Jake can still meet Sinu if he wants.
Episode 346
Samuel takes Jake to the basement, where there is a lit room with a stage and multiple bleachers. Sinu used to fight here in the Workers’ underground fighting ring. He and other prisoners were treated like animals and had to fight year long under grueling conditions. Samuel used to talk to Sinu during his breaks, but Sinu only remembered Jake and how he would save him. Samuel wondered if it was a side effect of the drugs he was taking. He would give him a pen to write with so he could have some amount of freedom, and Sinu would write on the walls. He filled the walls and the floor with the names of the Big Deal members so he wouldn't forget. Jake demands Samuel tell him where SInu is captured. He tells Jake that Sinu was moved to a bigger stadium, and that he brought him to this room to have a private place to speak. Samuel also says he will help him find Sinu if Jake helps him become king.
Daniel returns home and is upset that he didn’t do much, but happy that everyone is safe. He managed to steal some of Vivi’s cookies, so he plans on giving it to Steve Hong. He bumps into DG and drops the cookie, which the latter picks up and says he will be confiscating.
