Summary
Vin's two sidekicks watch in horror as Vin mocks Vasco, calling him "the fool from Construction Dept." However, as Vin tries a leg sweep on Vasco, the latter refuses to budge, and instead flips Zack with one hand, effectively removing his sunglasses. Duke asks Vasco if he can become strong as well, to which Vasco gives him his insane workout plan.
The last event is the relay race. Since the Beauty department has only one guy when there is need of two, Zack has volunteered to help, and he faces calls of traitor has he stands beside Daniel and Ho Jeong. As
Eli
and Jay come racing, neck to neck, Daniel internally thanks Jay for the baton. Daniel and Zack race, and they are both running at the same speed.
