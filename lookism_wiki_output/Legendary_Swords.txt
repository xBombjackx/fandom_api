The
Legendary Swords
are a unique set of legendary swords so sharp that in the hands of a skilled swordsman they can cut through anything, even the indestructible
Black Bone
of the
Yamazaki Clan
, which is immune to cuts. Currently there are only two examples of renowned swords in the world, one in Japan in the possession of the Yamazaki Syndicate and one in Korea in Incheon.
