Summary
Kouji explains that losing the money was a necessary step to gain access to the system. He makes a bot who tells the gamblers that the system made a deposit into their accounts, and the accounts fill with money. Kouji takes all the money from the gambling account and gives Jiho his amount, telling him to live better.
Vasco and Jace are shocked to see Jake defeated by Gun. Vasco asks if he is weak and Gun responds that he doesn't remember the names of weak guys. He then proceeds to call him "Tabasco". Jiho goes back to school happy and cured of his addiction.
