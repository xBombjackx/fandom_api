Summary
As Gun marvels at Eli's savagery, Jerry and Johan quarrel over the right to Gangdong. Jerry says he will allow Johan if he can land a scratch on his face, and Johan uses Lyon to scratch him. Eli and Johan begin fighting, with Johan easily winning the fight. Gun and Jerry analyze their fighting style, with Jerry saying he doesn't like how ruthless Johan is. Johan doesn't seem to care about fairness, saying that the only thing that matters in the world is power.
When Johan knocks Eli out he asks Gun to give him the right to Gangdong. Gun refuses because Johan is too weak, and Eli proves this by knocking him out in one shot. Gun asks Jerry to take Johan home and asks Eli what makes him so desperate. Eli responds that he wants to take care of his family, and Gun is triggered and decides to destroy Hostel as revenge for ruining Backdoor.
He begins his assault by grabbing Max and Derrick and threatening them. Warren laughs at Gun because Max and Derrick are the only people he ever lost to. Warren, Eli, Max and Derrick surround Gun and prepare to fight him four on one.
