Summary
At first,
Duke
is embarrassed to reveal he is poor to
Daniel
, but Daniel does not care about it. He has a good voice but not that much practice, and he and Duke practice. Daniel practices at his night job and runs into
the pretty girl
, who compliments his voice. He also meets
Jiho
and Duke, and Jiho apologizes to him.
The three of them sit outside the store and reminisce about their days being bullied.
Vasco
overhears and asks about Daniel. He learns that Daniel genuinely cares about his friends and feels bad he misjudged him. He tells Daniel he is not weak and he can help him work out. Duke is impressed to see Daniel improved overnight and is confident about the festival.
