Summary
Samuel
and
Eli
are grappling. Eli asks Samuel why he is holding back, and Samuel asks Eli what he wants. The chart he was looking at earlier with
Jin Jang
was the chart of crew heads he had to get on his side.
Jake
tells
Vasco
that he shouldn't change and become a bad guy, and Vasco rejects this notion, preparing to slam him with elbows.
Eugene
tells
Mandeok
to test
Daniel
, but
Zack
interrupts and starts monologuing about how he loses despite trying his best. Mandeok punches him but Zack gets up as though nothing happened, saying it is comical how often he fights without winning. He then does an instinctual spin that Daniel recognizes from his ultra instinct mode. Zack tells Mandeok the reason he keeps losing is because he tried to get rid of negative emotions, when he should have gotten rid of all emotion entirely. Eugene tells Mandeok to ask his name, and Zack introduces himself as a wimp. Daniel takes the chance to lunge at Eugene, but
the guy in the cap
stops him. Daniel senses that he is the strongest one there.
