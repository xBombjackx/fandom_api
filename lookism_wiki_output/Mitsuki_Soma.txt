Mitsuki Soma
(
相馬美月 Sōma Midzuki
)
also known as Neko is the CEO of the 2nd Worker Affiliate.
Appearance
Neko has a mole under her eye, fair light skin, a slender yet fit body and has long hair with the sides cut short.
Personality
Neko tends to be possessive with things she loves especially with Sinu Han whom she has feelings for. She loves the feeling of power and loves to give threatening glares to people who oppose her.
She believes that all men are disgusting, thanks to her father failing to uphold his business because of his lack of sexual discipline. Later, it was shown that he missed Mitsuki’s mother's anniversary of passing due to the same reason, causing Mitsuki to reinforce this belief. Mitsuki is shown to be extremely twisted, often taking pleasure in manipulating Sinu Han to fight for her.

Past
In Mitsuki’s flashback, she was the hostess of a casino after taking her father’s legacy, who was an irresponsible man which made her despise him. Soon then, Vivi introduced her to Eugene and brought her to the 3rd affiliate, where it was still built for the underground fight club.
When Eugene escorted Mitsuki into the building, he showed her the arena where there was a brawl going on, and that was where she met Sinu for the first time. Eugene explained Sinu’s past after Mitsuki questioned about him, and she began to like him due to his ideal personality which was completely different from her father’s.
Not so long after, Mitsuki wanted to take Sinu with her, but Eugene refused because he belonged to Workers, which made her displeased. Eugene suddenly offered her a position as the head of the affiliate, and he would allow her to work with Sinu as in return, which she agreed eventually.
Someday, Mitsuki got worried and ran to Sinu after the show, but he turned her down because he’s not interested in her, saying he only followed her orders for the sake of his friends in Gangseo. Thus, she broke down in tears and demanded Eugene to brainwash him, so he came up with an idea of making a room that looks similar to the stores in Big Deal’s area.
When Mitsuki woke Sinu up, he found himself laying on her lap inside the room, and she manipulated him by telling him there was an incident that killed all of his friends including Jake Kim and proclaimed herself as Yeonhee.
