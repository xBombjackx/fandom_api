Logan Lee
(이태성 Lee Tae Sung)
is a former student of the comics department of J High School, and
Daniel Park's
archenemy.
Appearance
Logan is a young man with a overweight, yet buff, build. He is also tall, at 190 cm (6’3”) and became even taller later, making him one of the tallest characters in Lookism, possibly to make him more intimidating as an antagonist. He has black hair that stands up abnormally. Logan is usually seen with a bored face due to nothing entertaining him, such as a fight. Most of the time, he is seen either looking down upon those who are weak or glaring angrily at males who are considered attractive. He has a signature scowl of belittlement and judgment on his face when being called out. Due to his large size, his neck barely tapers to give a depth of his head to shoulder ratio.
Logan is usually seen wearing a black tiger shirt with a loose white dress shirt and slim black jeans. Oftentimes, he prefers not to wear his black shirt and leaves his dress shirt loose to expose the tattoos on his body.
He has a tattoo of Buddha on his stomach and a carp on his right arm. His back and the rest of his body are covered with tattoos in a wing-like pattern.
After being rejected by
Zoe
, Logan was heartbroken and trapped himself within his room for a long time eventually losing a lot of weight and became very thin.

Thin Logan is deemed quite attractive, as girls would stare at him in infatuation as he walked by. His tattoos looked different when he lost weight: his Buddha tattoo appeared as Gandhi, while the carp on his right arm appeared as small as a sardine fish. He did not maintain this look for long. Once he realized he was now attractive, he tried to use his looks to get to Zoe but was rejected again. This caused him to reason power and strength was greater than romance and binge eat his weight back.
Personality
Logan is a hateful person who will beat up anybody, including women. However, when he entered the animation department, he realized that he couldn't bully them because they all appeared to him as sheep.

Logan has a narcissistic attitude and is accompanied by his large, intimidating stature. He is always shown as the leader in the group at his old middle school prior to J High School.
Due to his hunger for blood and violence, he is known to transfer out of many schools.
Logan has a habit of not having people to look down on him, which makes him start up fights.
He has demonstrated his cruel behavior, when he attempted to break Vasco's leg after getting him into a leg lock.

He has a hatred towards women and attractive men due to his poor experiences within middle school. Because of this, he has no sympathy in inflicting pain on either man or woman.
Fighting Prowess
Logan is immensely powerful and strong, able to beat three upperclassmen who were twice his size. He has a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience when it comes to fighting. Logan is powerful in all areas (speed, strength, technique, and power), but his defense is most likely the most significant and distinguished factor which Logan, as an individual, is overwhelmingly best at.
Logan has a body that is perfect for any way of fighting he chooses but focuses most on power and strength since his body allows him to deliver blows with immense strength. Despite his huge stature, Logan is capable of moving at incredible speeds. He was even able to surprise
Zack
(a fighter well known for his speed) with a lightning-quick tackle that won him the fight. Even a tactical approach that focuses on technique is possible for Logan due to his experience in fighting. Best of all is his unbelievable endurance, which is one of the most impressive shows to date. Logan was able to fight 3 of the Jae Won high's top fighters all in one day with no desire to back down. He is able to endure hard jabs and punches, seen when he took multiple shots to the face from Zack without inflicting serious damage.
Logan has exceptional knowledge over wrestling and demonstrated it in when he tackled Zack after transferring to J High School.

One of his signature fighting tactics is to jab his targets straight into the solar plexus. He has demonstrated this many times to
Daniel
,
Zack
,
Vasco
, and
Vin Jin
.
When he had decided to lose weight Logan was faster than Zack Lee but had none of the endurance and strength he once had, thus becoming a punching bag for the entire school.
As noted by Goo during the Hostel Arc Logan has the ability to adapt to one's fighting style, especially if it is weapon oriented, this combined with his jiu-Jitsu, emphasis on dogfighting, his reliance and use of weaponry made him a true monster.

In fact, his endurance is so strong he can even fully recharge his stamina after 30 minutes of rest.

Trivia
After falling in love with Zoe, he was left heartbroken after realizing she was with someone else. After nearly a month, he returns to the school having lost 100 kg. Not only did he lose much of his body mass and muscle (Tattoos of Buddha becoming Gandhi, and a carp into a minnow), but he also became handsome.

Though he realized how wonderful it is to be handsome and be able to influence others, he also became aware of how weak he has become. Despite being more attractive to Zoe, he was rejected for his attitude and returned with an even bigger weight and bigger tendency for violence.

He has an incredible sense of technique, that combined with immense power and size makes him one of the most prominent fighters in the story. Whilst he has held his own against the likes of Vasco, Vin, Jay, Daniel, and Zack; the only fight that he has presumably lost was against Goo. During the Stalker Arc, Goo was seen confronting him due to Lee beating up multiple seniors who were collecting money from the lowerclassmen students, which caused trouble to Gun and Goo's business. Logan later stated that Goo almost broke his shoulder during their fight, and was seen with several bruises and marks on his face in the aftermath when Logan was told that he was transferring schools
Logan is often described as a bear on peak of food chain. However, he is depicted as a raptor when he is furious.
