Summary
Jin Jang suspects that Eli will be in trouble because he hasn't fought in a while, and Jay was overprotected as a child. Jace thinks otherwise, believing that Jay and Eli are just hiding their strength. Eli has difficulty fighting the Park brothers because they are trained and he is a streetfighter, and Jay has the opposite problem. Jin reveals that he set up these matches so they would have no chance of winning.
Jace has faith that Eli will win his fight regardless of his weaknesses because Eli has determination and willpower. He will do anything for
Yenna
, and when he realizes he is late to pick her up he goes into savage mode. Jace is also unconcerned for Jay, believing that Jay still has one trick up his sleeve: the contents of his suitcase that nobody knows. With these words Jay pulls out a gun and aims a laser at Dominic's forehead.
