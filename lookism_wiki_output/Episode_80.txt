Summary
Daniel runs into Vasco while getting robbed on the way. He explains to Vasco the situation and he instantly believes him, saying Daniel does not tell lies. As Eli stares at Crystal she remembers how kind he has been towards her and wonders if he is attracted to her. She denies it because no one can be attracted to her fat body.
Daniel returns to the escort service to settle everything and meets the woman from before. She gives him the rice cooker he asked for but it is filled with money. He doesn't accept the money but is thankful. When he calls his mother he realizes he is ashamed of the work he did and lies about it. He goes back to working at the convenience store.
Cookie
Daniel thanks Jay for washing the suit he lent him. Jay did not actually wash the suit though; he just bought him a new one because he couldn't wash it, and let the dogs wear the older one.
