is horrified to find out that
Vasco
has no plans for the future. He drags him around the different departments where Vasco finds out everyone has a plan for when they graduate, even the bullies.
Gordon Park comes across the principal, who is very disappointed in the chaotic behavior of the architecture students. He warns Mr. Park to get them under control or he will be fired. When he hears that
Jasmine Huh
has lost her wallet he decides to do a locker sweep to catch the person who stole it.
The architecture students are surprised Mr. Park would suspect them. Vasco does not believe any one of them is guilty, and encourages the homeroom teacher to expel the culprit if he finds them. He is shocked to find Jasmine's wallet is in his locker, and Mr. Park decides to expel him.
