—Yamazaki Shingen  in
episode 521
Shingen Yamazaki is the father of
Gun Park
and the former President of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
He is the
Great Power
which the 0th Generation fought against. He has fought
Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang
at some point before Gun's birth and this led to him falling into a lethargic stupor. He is revealed to have been the younger brother of Shintaro Yamazaki all along, who became the head of the clan due to the midwife's scheme.
Appearance
Shingen was a tall and muscular middle-aged man with long black hair and white eyes with black clera. He had around his body from neck to toe tattoos who range from tiger-shaped patterns, one on his back and two on his broad shoulders and a bunch of cloud tattoos over his body. He wears nothing but a simple white tonga, but he casually wears a black hanfu tied by a dark gray rope under a dark gray kimono.
Personality
Shingen's behavior by the time he had fathered Gun and his brothers is like that of a introvert, he is also cold to most of everyone he meets and sees, and it seems he doesn't even know the children that he has from all of his concubines, Gun is one of the many children of his.
As noted by his father and concubine, Shingen had once been an exceptionally vicious and blood thirsty man and was feared as a literal demon by both his syndicate and enemies. However, as implied, his defeat by
Gapryong Kim
and his gang had caused a severe psychological blow to him. After his defeat, Shingen had become extremely lethargic and practically unresponsive to almost everyone and everything. So much so that he barely payed attention to “concubines”, of which he barely payed conscious attention to and he himself had no idea that he even had children with them. This is shown where he hardly ever payed attention or noticed Gun’s mother despite spending so much time together with her and despite her talking so much about their son and his accomplishments, Shingen had likely completely ignored her. Having no idea who Gun was when he came face to face with him and asked him who he was.
Despite his generally lethergic and apathetic behavior, Shingen can come out of it should he find sufficient reason to. As shown when he had taken action to defend himself when the three vassal family heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate had tried to kill him. As shown, Shingen retains deep respect for his “opponent” who is in Korea and he refused to die or be defeated by anyone elses hand.
During his last fight against his twin brother, Shintaro, Shingen fully exhibited his emotions. As shown where he showcased the deep love, care and trust he had for his twin brother refusing to believe that he would betray him. Shingen himself admitted that if Shintaro has simply asked him for the position of the head of the Yamazaki, Shingen would give it to him no questions asked, with him expressing that he always believed that Shintaro was much more suited for the position.  Later, he would finally acknowledged Somi when she betrayed him and stabbed him, expressing interest in her when she began revealing her true emotions. When two of his sons came to his side to help him fend off Shintaro’s forces, Shingen expressed surprise and developed a level of attachment to them immediatly, with him later expressing anger when Shintaro killed them. In the end, Shingen eventually acknowledged Gun and died protecting him.
During his youth, Shingen also exhibited an outgoing personality and seemed generally positive as a person. It is likely that his circumstances were similar to Gun and the way he seemed "vicious" and "bloodthirsty" to others was most likely instilled into him by his father.
Relationships
Gun Park
Shingen is seen to be cold to everyone, it is shown he doesn't really know who Gun is as the first interaction of him and Gun is strained and it seems that he could probably not know his other kids.
During Shintaro's rebellion, Shingen started expressing interest in Gun, to the extent of even protecting him and losing an arm in the process. Before his death, Shingen apologises to Gun and saves Gun's life in one final act of sincerity in exchange for losing his life.
Shintaro Yamazaki
Shingen had a sibling and brotherly relationship with Shintaro, which was shown positively during their youth. Despite the internal turmoils and tragedy that would come in their adulthood, Shingen still loved his brother and believed that he wouldn't go as far as to deliberately start a rebellion on his own and that there was a misunderstanding, also admitting in tandem that he would've given him the position if he just asked. Shingen spent his last moments apologizing to Shintaro and understood why his anger came to be.
Somi Park
Shingen initially showed signs of coldness towards Somi due to his lethargic state, but when the rebellion instigated by Shintaro came to be, Shingen admitted he was expressing interest in the latter and even spared her life despite being one of the traitors going against him.
Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
Shingen during the era of Gapryong's Fist.
He was one of the two people who were a threat to Gapryong Kim at the time. Due in part to his colossal size and muscularity, he fights ferociously and brutally, maiming many of the gang members who ambushed him effortlessly. He also possesses the "Black Bone" trait which supposedly makes him immune or somewhat invulnerable to blades and swords. Like all the generational heads of Yamazaki clan he also inherited Ultra Instinct State with a greater control over it, due to his ogre like build he has immense strength to fight all the vassals of Yamazaki clan who rebelled against him.
Even in his lethargic state, Shingen was still powerful enough to gradually overwhelm Shintaro despite likely not having fought since his defeat at the hands of Gapryoung Kim. It was as such that Shintaro severely wounding him with the Yodo Muramasa and taking one of his arms away was due to Shingen deliberately letting him so, in an act to protect Gun, rather than Shingen not being able to intercept his attacks.
Congenital Ultra Instinct
"Do you know why he fights alone when he wants to go all out? That's because while others adjust their Ultra Instincts to become stronger, Shingen adjusts his Ultra Instinct to suppress his strength, to avoid tearing his subordinates into pieces. The Trait of the Yamazaki is indiscriminate violence. The Child of the Reverse Eyes is the one born with that nature. The moment the child with the Reverse Eyes stops controlling his Ultra Instinct,
the Oni comes out."
-
Gapryong Kim
, CHAPTER 525
Being born with the Reverse Eyes congenitally, Shingen is also capable of entering a true-unconscious state where he relinquishes his control over his Ultra Instinct and starts fighting purely on his own instincts for battle. In this state, Shingen is incapable of distinguishing allies from foes, and is unconscious about his own strength.
In this state, not only was he capable of ripping bodies apart near effortlessly even with only one arm and fatal injuries all over his body, but was also vastly more powerful than Shintaro and even rendered the advantage of the Yodo Muramasa completely null.
