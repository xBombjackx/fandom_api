History
Possibly kept in the inventory of the Yamazaki Syndicate, the Yodo Muramasa was used by Shintaro Yamazaki during his rebellion to seize control of the Syndicate. Using it, Shintaro was able to cut off Shingen Yamazaki's left arm, as both he and his brother possessed the Black Bone at birth. Later on the night of the rebellion, the Yodo Muramasa was used along with several other swords to kill Shingen Yamazaki.
More than 5 years later, after Gun Park's return to Japan. Shintaro overwhelms Gun with his strength and immobilizes him to execute him with the Yodo Muramasa, however, Somi Park instinctively steps in front of the attack, killing her. After that, Gun enters a state of unconsciousness similar to Shingen's, thus defeating and killing Shintaro with his own hands.
This night was the last where the Yodo Muramasa was seen in the series.
