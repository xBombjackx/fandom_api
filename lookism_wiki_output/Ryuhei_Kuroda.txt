Ryuhei Kuroda (
黒田竜平 Kuroda Ryūhei
)
also known as "Nomen" and "Kagiroi" is an executive of the 2nd Affiliate of Workers and serves as Neko's bodyguard. He is the leader of Kanto's strongest biker gang which is also named Kagiroi.
Appearance
Nomen is an attractive young man who has dyed yellow spiky hair and black eyes. He is very tall and has a slim body figure. He usually wears a black suit with an orange tie and a white coat with the sleeve that has the Japanese kanji (天上天下/てんじょうてん　げ) which means “throughout heaven and earth). Nomen's jacket is an item he has held from his past as Kagiroi's leader with the rest of his outfit being the standard Workers uniform.
Nomen's outfit whilst operating as the Kagiroi was seen to be all white with loafers, dress pants, and a button-up shirt with a red trim.
Personality
Nomen's core characteristic is his extreme drive. This drive has manifested in both his conquering of the Kanto region of Japan whilst operating as nothing more than a biker gang whilst he was contending with the Yakuza. This drive has also manifested lustfully as his extreme attraction towards Neko or Mitsuki despite her open and extreme adoration towards Sinu Han.
In either case, he displays a relaxed aura both towards his gang and whilst flirting and openly soliciting sex with Neko. This results in him being viewed as highly charismatic and intimidating by his gang and other fighters but as nothing more than obnoxious by Neko. The above leads to Nomen openly antagonising all people that make advances or seem to make advances on Neko.
However, this bellies Nomen's own genuine love for Neko. Nomen's lustful actions manifesting partially out of his prior experience of simply and easily obtaining women due to his position and charisma. Nomen is willing to lay down his own life for Neko not simply out of a mere desire for sex.
Nomen is also able to display genuine respect for others, seeing Sinu Han as a rival vying for Neko's attraction alongside himself.
Relationships
Workers 2nd Affiliation
Mitsuki Soma
She is Nomen's main love interest, though their relationship is one-sided with Mitsuki actively disliking Nomen due to their first meeting and her misandry.
Sinu Han
He is viewed by Nomen as his "rival" with Nomen antagonising him though he does respect him.
Synopsis
History
Before Nomen was a member of Workers as Mitsuki's bodyguard, he was the leader of a biker gang in the Kanto region entitled "Kagiroi". Kagiroi's presence was such that they were mythologised as a boogeyman to scare children into being quiet. Kagiroi was strong enough to conquer the Yakuza in the Kanto region even leading to them being known by Gun.
Despite this, Nomen suffered from one thing: erectile dysfunction. The cause of this was unknown to him, and caused him great distress, emasculating him and depriving him of multiple sexual encounters. However, his continual dismissal of women that wanted him appeared to his gang as him simply having a high standard for women.
Eventually, after Soma Mitsuki took over her father's business, she approached Kagiroi as a business partner and her first bodyguard. Nomen, upon seeing Mitsuki gained an erection for the first time in multiple years. Nomen immediately asked Mitsuki out to view the fireworks. Mitsuki was understandably disgusted by this, her disgust compounded by her pre-existing misandry. However, Mitsuki's disgust only increased Nomen's attraction for her leading him to vow that he would make her his woman.
Fighting Prowess
Nomen is a powerful fighter with seemingly no martial arts background. However, his fighting ability is correlated to his motivation, seemingly compounded greatly if he is in a situation wherein he is threatened.
Nomen's fighting is completely ad-hoc with pure strength as its cornerstone with seemingly no grappling skills.
Ryuhei also has an insane level of weapon proficiency when wielding his Berserker a wooden sword wrapped in chains he was able to use this weapon to trade hits with
Gun Park

Trivia
