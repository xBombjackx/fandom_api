Summary
On his way to find the baby, Zack is hit by a car. He doesn't stop running until he sees Mira with the baby. She placed her phone number in her pocket and the baby called her when she realized she was lost.
Zack buys a baby carrier and he and Mira go to a restaurant. On the street they are harassed by older people who complain that they are irresponsible teens. Zack ignores the comments and they go out to eat. The owners of the restaurant reminisce about their first child while watching them.
Mira and Zack return the baby to the police department. As Zack is leaving, the baby holds his finger and calls him Papa, bringing him to tears.
