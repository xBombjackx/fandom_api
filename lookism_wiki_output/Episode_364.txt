Summary
As
Daniel
is fighting
Hudson
, Hudson recalls his call with
his senior
. He told the guy that
James Lee
may arrive in Seoul to squash the people using his name. His senior tells him not to use that name in vain, and Hudson says he is not joking. Daniel continues to slash Hudson in real time, and he says that the King of Ansan is coming, and he can’t let him see this mess. He rips off his shirt.
Channing
remembers when he used to bully people in school, tormenting his victims out of boredom. He tells
Vasco
he wants to be remembered forever as well, and slashes him with his tattoo gun. He mocks Vasco for playing crew with the
Burn Knuckles
, who are scrubs. Vasco says that he knows this, and it doesn’t matter because he will fight on their behalf. He said the same thing to the Burn Knuckles before, and
Jake
acknowledges this side of Vasco to
Lineman.
He punches Channing in the face, breaking the ground underneath him. Channing is stunned by the blow, and pulls out some more needles but Vasco keeps beating him. He wails that he was recognized by
Gun
and
Goo
three years ago, and Vasco uses
Brekdak’s
fifth forbidden move, and then a compressed low kick (his third forbidden move). Channing’s legs are crippled and Vasco tries to turn himself in, but the cop refuses.
Ethan
carries
Darius
out of the building so he and the other
Backdoor
members can guard the entrance of the hideout.
DG
arrives and asks who is using his name. Darius orders Backdoor to capture DG, and he decides fists will work better than words.
