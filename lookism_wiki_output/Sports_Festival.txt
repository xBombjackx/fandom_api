Synopsis
Episode 91
Zack
has not been to school lately, and
Jiho
asks the class president who will run on Sports Day.
Yui
is in the second position, and the president decides that anyone fast enough to dodge
Zack's
punches can run quickly as well.
Daniel
is put as the third runner, and after seeing this,
Jay
volunteers for second. They are missing a girl runner when Zack appears, having been in special training, and is intent on proving to
Mira
that he is better than Daniel.
In a men's soccer game between the Fashion and Practical Music departments, Zack scores a goal from close up. Fashion's costume is a honeybee while Practical Music is dressed as animals. As Daniel gets the ball, Zack thinks that Daniel cannot do any better than what he did, getting past ten guys. Then, Zack thinks of his experiences seeing his bullies kick a ball, and scores a long-distance shot.
In tug of war, Music vs Vocal and Dance, Practical Music prevails. The next is Fashion vs. Architecture, the latter dressed as riding dinosaurs, and
Vasco
challenges Daniel to a one-on-one tug of war contest.
Episode 92
The tug of war commences, and Zack causes a Fashion forefeit by purposefully tying Daniel's end of the rope to a basketball hoop, which Vasco pulls down anyway.
Vin
kicks
Duke
to take out his frustration.
In Practical Music vs. Architecture's Break the Gourd, Practical Music wonders why none of the Architecture students are throwing. Then, they realize that they are just waiting for Vasco, who breaks the gourd in one shot. Zack also throws well in Fashion vs. Vocal and Dance, but Daniel also delivers the final blow. Again, Vin smacks Duke, callling him a roadblock. After Duke insists that he has done nothing wrong, he is beaten in a deserted alley. Vasco appears to help him, telling him that he is cool before taking off his shirt.
Episode 93
Vin's two sidekicks watch in horror as Vin mocks Vasco, calling him "the fool from Construction Dept." However, as Vin tries a leg sweep on Vasco, the latter refuses to budge, and instead flips Zack with one hand, effectively removing his sunglasses. Duke asks Vasco if he can become strong as well, to which Vasco gives him his insane workout plan.
The last event is the relay race. Since the Beauty department has only one guy when there is need of two, Zack has volunteered to help, and he faces calls of traitor has he stands beside Daniel and Ho Jeong. As
Eli
and Jay come racing, neck to neck, Daniel internally thanks Jay for the baton. Daniel and Zack race, and they are both running at the same speed.
Episode 94
Zack pulls ahead near the end of the race. Since Mira is watching, he is determined to win.
Young Mira shows young Zack her stuffed bear Brownie, calling it her best friend. Zack calls it childish, and asks what he is if the bear is her best friend. As Mira drops Brownie, Zack demands if this is how she treats her best friend when he realizes Mira is in pain. After running Mira to the hospital, it is revealed that Mira had burst her appendix, but she thanks Zack, saying that he was amazing.
Meanwhile, in present day, Zack runs out of stamina. Daniel overtakes him by 0.04 seconds. In the talent show, Daniel and Duke perform again.
Zack is sitting on the steps, mourning his loss, when Mira and Daniel come to find him. He does not hear Daniel's explanation for being with Mira and instead assumes that it is because he is a loser. However, Mira drops her phone, which Daniel fails to catch. However, Zack is closer to the phone and is able to catch it. Mira says he has saved Brownie again, and Zack sees the bear keychain attached to her phone. Again, Zack is called amazing, and he is in renewed spirit as he heads to the party. At the party, he continues to catch anything that is dropped.
Episode 95
It's raining and dark out.
Mira
and
Zack
are sharing an umbrella as they walk to school. Mira had forgotten her cellphone at school, and Zack had agreed to accompany her to school.
When at school, Mira suddenly sees two figures and screams. It turns out to be
Jace
and
Vasco
. Vasco clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. They great each other and ask if Zack's ok. Zack pretends he is, but he is actually frozen in fear.
It turns out that Vasco and Jace are there because of the story of the ghost lady. Apparently, at the end of the school corridor, there's a storage room that holds a portrait of the ghost lady. The story goes that the lady had married rich, but had been chased into the streets on a rainy day right after her children were born. Hence, she haunts the schoolyard when it rains, trying to find her children. If someone who isn't a child looks into her eyes, they will die unless they either cry like a baby or give her a doll. If they give her a doll, the ghost lady would be so glad that she would disappear and grant the person a wish.
Vasco says that he's come because he wanted to make a wish for people to stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Vasco's superstitious ideas, making fun of Vasco, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.
When Zack arrives at the storage room, he realizes that the lights can't open. He then rushes over to a pane of glass, only to see the portrait of the ghost lady leering at him, bloodshot eyes wide. Zack hurriedly signs his name on the glass and skidaddles. As he runs back to the classroom, he cries like a baby just in case.
At the classroom, Jace is incredulous that Zack had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Vasco, but, Vasco, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.
The next morning, the school is abuzz with the news that Zack had signed his name on the portrait, and everyone flocks to the storage room to see if it is true.
When they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane. Zack realizes that the portrait's lady's eyes are closed, and that he had actually seen the ghost the night before. He faints and wets his pants.
In the end, he explains that whether he had hallucinated due to fear or had actually seen a ghost, the important thing is that Mira saw him wet his pants.
In the epilogue,
Daniel
says that he's felt as if someone was following for a while already. He wonders if he's ill. The ghost lady is seen following him, blushing. The chapter ends, saying that the ghost lady seems to have fallen in love.
