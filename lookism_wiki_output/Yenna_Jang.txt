Yenna,
nicknamed
Zami
by
Zack
, is a minor character in Lookism. She is the daughter of
Eli Jang
And
Heather
and is the youngest member of
Hostel B
.
Appearance
She shares her mother's her big black eyes and has brown hair, which is odd, since both Eli and Heather share black hair. One can assume that both of them shared this recessive trait or Eli simply dyed it. The combination of these two traits gave her a strikingly similar appearance to
Mira
, so much so that even Zack mistook her for Mira's child.
Yenna is shown to usually wear a yellow frock with collars and a front pocket. She wears yellow shoes with white socks.
Personality
Yenna is a toddler and has yet to develop a personality of her own, she is usually seen smiling innocently at everyone. However, in the time she spent with Mira and Zack, it was shown that she shared a lot of parallels with Zack. Both of them find it troublesome to meet new people but quickly open up to them and try to show as much kindness to them, Yenna acted so much like Zack that the officer at the police station commented that if they didn't know any better, he could be mistaken as her father.
Relationships
Eli Jang
As her father and only guardian, Yenna loves her father a lot. According to Eli, she is the greatest gift he ever had, even if she may be troublesome. He works very hard for her and looks after her even during his work all while juggling with his school work too. He is very protective of Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he has ever got.
A God Dog threatens to hurt Yena.
He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew, when they threatened to hurt Yenna.
He usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna, as can be seen when he did not protest even though some of the God Dogs treated him harshly.
When Choi Soo Jung volunteered to look after Yenna, he was very hesitant as he did not want her to leave his eyesight. He probably had this attitude from the beginning itself, but it must have been reinforced after Yenna went missing for the first time.
Eli is noted to be a very good father by
Crystal Choi
.
Zack Lee

At first, Zack found her troublesome but soon his affection grew for her as he realized how adorable she was. When she went missing, he was very desperate to find her, even though he was severely injured.
By the time he and
Mira
returned her to the police station, he was so overprotective of her, the officer at work commented that he could be mistaken as her father.
He is the one who nicknamed her
Zami
(in the English version), which is his and Mi Jin's names combined.
Mira Kim
Mira found her at the restaurant where she and Zack were supposed to have their date. She took care of Yenna till Zack came and suggested that they take her to the police station. She is very fond of her and rather protective of her.
She was very angry when Yenna went missing under Zack's watch. Since she didn't want Yenna to go missing again, she had put her phone number in Yenna's pocket, which shows how much she cared for Yenna.
Crystal Choi
Yenna is shown to be fond of Crystal. This is also the reason why Crystal volunteered to take care of her while Eli worked.
