Synopsis
Episode 370
The police arrive at the convenience store and find Daniel passed out on the ground, and Wally popping bottles of butane. Daniel warns them that Jiho is on the run. Jiho threatens a taxi driver to take him to Gangbuk. Jiho heads to Ansan Public's base and says they still have a chance of winning if they can use Daniel's female friends as hostages. Jacky and Channing blame Jiho for their injuries and refuse to help in the slightest. Jiho wonders who he can go to for help, since Darius is missing. He remembers Jake Kim and decides to go to him. On the way though he runs into some old bullies from J High, and they pee on him.
Jiho comes to Big Deal's base and asks to see Jake. Jake Kim comes out and Jiho starts explaining his plan about taking over Seoul. Jake stops Jiho and tells him to go to the hospital first, since he's not okay. Jiho takes this as Jake abandoning him, and he takes out a knife. He says he'll tell Jake about Daniel's secret if he offers to take him in.
Episode 371
Without hesitating, Jiho tells Jake that Daniel has two bodies. Jake grabs Jiho and yells at him to get it together, and that Jiho should have never left prison without taking care of his condition. He asks Jiho who he met in prison, and Jiho runs away. Worried about him, Jake sends two of his men after Jiho.
Jake talks to Brad and Jason about Jiho. Jason mentions how Jiho got a lighter sentence of two years despite his charge of attempted homicide, and Brad says it's understandable he wouldn't want to be caught. A Big Deal member comes in to tell Jake they've found Jiho, but there's a problem. Daniel Park and the detective run to a building where Jiho is on the roof, talking to someone. At some point, Jiho falls off the roof and Daniel fails to catch him.
At Jiho's funeral his parents weep for him. The detective goes over his medical report and notes that the reason for his early release was a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. The police searched the security cameras after the incident, but they couldn't find a second person. Only Jiho had entered the building. It turns out Jiho had been talking to a younger version of himself, who assured him that he has a plan to win before pushing him off the building. As he falls, Jiho thinks that he isn't a bug.
Eugene is on the phone when someone asks him why he seems happy. He mentions that a friend of his passed recently, but also that the sales of his circus have been rising. He compliments the Workers 2nd affiliate.
