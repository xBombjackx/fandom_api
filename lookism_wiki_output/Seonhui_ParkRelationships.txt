Daniel's Grandmother
Daniel Park
First Body
As Daniel's mother, she is very protective of him. When she finds out he's being bullied, she charges at them despite being half their size and immediately transfers Daniel Park out of the school despite financial problems. She never considered Daniel as a burden to her. She is rarely seen scolding Daniel. She always tries to make good food for him and even saved up money for his glasses.
When Daniel slowly became more responsible, she became very proud of him. She was really grateful for the gift he gave to her on Thanksgiving. She was also happy at her son's progress in academics and was glad he wasn't being bullied at J High.
Second Body
While Daniel visited his mother in his other body, she treated him kindly and is very generous. She gave Daniel (currently in his other body) 5,000 won from picking up scraps and told him to take care of her son (Daniel in his normal body). She was grateful to new Daniel for not bullying her own son.
