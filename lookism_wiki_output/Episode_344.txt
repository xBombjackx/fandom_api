Summary
Goo pretends he isn’t interested in fighting Daniel before slicing at him with the spear. Daniel dodges it and the two of them begin fighting. Goo keeps on rambling and looking for openings, but Daniel isn’t letting up. Daniel breaks his weapon and Goo becomes serious for once.
Logan Lee arrives in the elevator to see Goo lying on the ground, bloodied and with a broken arm. Daniel is unconscious on the ground. Goo complains to Logan that he had to use
batto
, and Goo corrects him that he used Korean kendo instead.
Logan picks up Vivi and Xiaolong to take with him. Daniel tells him to leave them there or he’ll kill him. Daniel remembers telling Sophia that the other reason he wanted to become strong was so he could beat Logan Lee, since he can also copy moves.
