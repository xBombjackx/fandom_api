Background
Logan at a young age
During his middle school years, he once dated
Mae's ex-girlfriend
and was considered the King. One day, he was excited to meet his girlfriend after school and hoped to meet her so he could give her a present. He tried to text her in a 'manly' way, asking if she wanted to meet. His girlfriend replied, saying that they couldn't meet because she had a curfew. Not believing this excuse so easily, he replied again repeating his question. Logan looked up to see his girlfriend sitting with another guy across the park. He overheard their conversation in which they were insulting him behind his back and talking about how they should reveal that they're a couple.
Logan's first Appearance in chapter 1
Logan, enraged at his two-faced girlfriend who cheated on him and her boyfriend (who pretended to care about him), punched both of them in the face. From that day onward, he had an inferiority complex around attractive guys and hated girls when it came to romance because he thought that they were shallow people who only care about looks.
Exposition
Logan and a girl are smoking in the bathroom together. He tells Daniel that if a teacher came, Daniel had to use his fat body to stop him. he tells Daniel to act like Pikachu to amuse himself, and puts his wet shoe to Daniel's face to kick him into the urinal.
In the classroom, he nails Daniel in the stomach. His friend laughs with him because he made Daniel faint. Daniel abruptly gets up when he is told to imitate Pikachu, and he imitates Pikachu's thunderbolt move on command. Upon request, he lets his friend borrow Daniel for the day to deliver a gift for a 100th day anniversary.

Troubled Transfer Arc
He enters to bathroom, mumbling "watashiwa" to himself because the class he was in kept repeating it. Jin Vin and the others in the bathroom hear him and make fun of him for it, and they say he must have been from the comics department.
Jin Vin licks his finger and rubs it on one of Logan's tattoos. Logan asks if he was trying to start something, and Jin Vin just laughs at him, not taking the threat seriously. Jin Vin attempts to spin Logan onto the floor, but Logan grabs him and headbutts him instead. Jin Vin's glasses break and he covers his eyes. Jay-gal Gong sees how Logan took down Jin Vin and is shocked that someone in his department would have skill.
Logan tries to move Jin Vin's eyes away to see his face, but Jin Vin is stubborn and refuses to let anyone see. Teachers come before Logan can finish. Logan goes out the window before he can get caught, and the teachers only see Jin Vin, his two friends, and a broken window.

Jay-gal Gong later goes to Logan and asks to be his friend. Logan slaps him and tells him to avert his eyes. He then stands up and tells everyone not to step out of line, or else they'll be crushed. Jay-gal happily thinks that the comics department could rise. He offers Logan a box f apple juice later in the day, and while Logan thinks that he's annoying, he might also be useful to have around.
Jay-gal sees Zack around, and he gets the idea of starting a fight between Zack and Logan. Logan ends up angry at Zack, and he pours food on Mira. Once Zack had made sure Mira was alright, he throws the first fist at Logan. Logan ends up tackling Zack to the ground and Zack screams, alerting Vasco.

In the cafeteria, Mira returns and steps in front of Zack to defend him. Logan grabs the girl's hair, but Zack gets up and punches him from under the jaw. Before Zack and Logan can get back into their fight, Vasco grabs Logan's shoulder and tells them not to fight. He squeezes Logan's shoulder and Logan falls to the ground.
Jin Vin also returns in a new pair of goggles, and he steps into the door and demands a rematch from Logan. In the end, Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin all challenge Logan to fight. Logan comments that the three are a balance of technique, strength, and speed. He thinks that the school is fun. He takes off his shirt and tells all of them to bring it on. This moment was Logan's debut at the new school.
Daniel shivers as he remembers how Logan bullied him at his old school. Jay glances at Logan, who was the cause of Daniel's shaking. Daniel goes to the nurse for his shaking. Later, Daniel and Logan are on opposite sides of the door to the nurse, and they are about to open it.

First Love Arc
Logan Lee tells Daniel to get out of his way when he walks into the door. He doesn't recognize Daniel, but gets instantly angry at him when Zoe tries to get close to Daniel. He grabs Daniel by the shoulder and is surprised to see that Daniel doesn't immediately collapse. He thinks to himself that Daniel was stronger than Zack, Vasco, and Jin Vin. Daniel kneels regardless because it was conditioned in him to kneel down to Logan. Logan is confused and wonders if Daniel was faking it.
Zoe demands that Logan let him go. He thinks that the girls in the school were also very brave. Logan tells her to get lost, and that she only cared about whether or not a guy had a nice face. Zoe yells out loud that she liked "the piggy", and that makes Logan release Daniel. He looks at Zoe and tells her that she was crazy and leaves. He doesn't believe that she would like Daniel in his original body.

He cries on the bench instead and chooses to miss school.

Logan enters the comics classroom, and a few girls watch him go in. After class, he thinks that people used to look at him in disgust, but now they looked at him in fondness. He goes behind a wall to smoke. The girls who were watching him catch up to him and ask him for a cigar. He tells them to leave him alone and they swoon, thinking he's playing hard to get. He gets extremely confused by their flirting.
He goes into the bathroom to examine himself. He says the carp tattoo on his arm changed into an anchovy and the buddha on his stomach into a gandhi. Two guys make fun of him, but instantly apologize after he glares at them. The two guys don't recognize him anymore. He thinks that his world had completely changed, even though he didn't act differently he was treated differently. Logan thinks that he could now confess to Zoe because he became handsome.
He doesn't see her, but he sees Mira. He drapes his arm around her because he thinks she'd like him, but Zack throws a bottle of Coke at him.

However, he is unable to lift Zack up anymore so Zack punches him in the jaw and he is much more strongly affected than before. His fighting style no longer suited his new figure.
He uncounters Jin Vin in the hall who also doesn't remember him and gets knocked out. When he wakes up, Vasco, who doesn't remember him either tries to help him up.Logan threatens him and Vasco sighs. He walks away with Jace when his help is refused. Jay-gal says that Logan no longer looks like a master. They fight, and Logan struggles to beat Jay-gal, although he could usually win without effort.
He continues to try to find Zoe, but a classmate says she is sick. He peers inside a classroom and sees a familiar head, mistaking Crystal for Daniel's original body. He says "Pikachu" out loud. Logan walks up to Crystal, and only then does he realize that it is not Daniel. She insults him, and he lifts his hand up to slap her, but is grabbed by Daniel.

Zoe finally appears at school and she helps him up. He asks for her number and she gives it to him. Zoe thinks that he is extremely handsome. They go out for juice, and Logan asks her out, but she declines. She says it's because she hated his personality. She then leaves because she sees Daniel's original body. Logan passes out from shame.

Zoe somehow still does not remember him. He then remembers how she said she liked Daniel's original body, and that leads him to the conclusion that Zoe liked him because she liked pigs.
