Lookism
.
Appearance
Wally is short and skinny, normally walking with his back hunched. He has long, straight black hair and whited-out eyes.
Personality
During the series he has shown unstable behaviour showing little care about people around, the only time he shown care was towards his so called lover Juliet a plant in the room and
Jiho
who watered Juliet. But this can change very quickly as when Wally sees that Jiho didn't water Juliet he tries to kill him. It could be possible that his behaviour is most likely due to drug usage as in Juvenile his name tag was blue.

Jiho Park
Earlier, he is shown to have protected Jiho from Darius Hong and his other cellmates, but it is revealed that he was not actually protecting Jiho but only his plant Juliet. He attacks Jiho and almost kills him when he sees his plant dying due to lack of water.
After Jiho is released from solitary confinement, he takes over all the cellmates including Wally using fear, making them do his dirty work and taking the blame for him. Wally attacked
Jason Yoon
on Jiho's orders after Jason challenged Jiho.
Darius Hong
