episode 520
The
mother of
Gun Park
.
She was one of the 8 women tasked to bear the child of
Yamazaki Shingen
as a member of the Hangure Family. As a punishment for coveting Shingen's body, she and the 7 other women had to cut off their left pinkies.
She told Gun to not partake in leisurely activities until Shingen gave him a proper name. Her brainwashing Gun to become ruthless lead to Gun slapping her which she accepted happily. After
Yamazaki Shintaro
and Somi betray Shingen, she helped Gun escape to Korea.
Later on, she passed away while trying to save Gun from being cut down by Shintaro.
Appearance
Missing her left pinky.
Has a carp tattoo on her right shoulder.
Personality
As shown, Somi was a woman of ambition and driven primarily out of loyalty and duty to her own family. As noted by
Shintaro Yamazaki
, Somi had willingly volunteered to become one of Shingen’s concubines was in order to elevate the  position and power of her family. Due to this, Somi constantly pushed Gun to become the ideal heir of the Yamazaki Family, frequently punishing him when he acts “unbefitting” as the future leader of the clan, such as when he acted like a regular child during his childhood, and pushed him to become more and more ruthless. With Somi validating this treatment and parenting towards him due to her placing her hope on him to help her achieve her aspirations.  Somi later showcased to have a fixation with Shingen and pushed her son to gain his acknowledgement, with the initial underlying reason being that she was in love with Shingen and hoped that Gun gaining his approval would finally get him to “see” her. However, Somi would later admit that she truly did not love or care either about Gun or Shingen, agreeing to Shintaro’s proposal to have her help him usurp Shingen’s position as the syndicate head when he offered to make him his new wife and have new son together with him to solidify her position and power as the true head wife of the Yamazaki. Agreeing to having both Shingen killed and Gun executed to secure Shintaro’s position as the new head. Ultimately showing that she did not truly love and care for Gun as her son nor love or care for Shingen as a romantic partner, but instead saw them as tools to further elevate her position and power in the Yamazaki clan.
However, as revealed, despite her actions being fueld by ambition and strong sense of duty to her family, Somi does indeed harbor genuine care and love for Gun. As shown where she had secretly helped him escape Japan after the death of his father to protect him and avoid being killed by Shintaro and the rest of the Yamazaki Syndicate to solidify the change of power. Later, she would die shielding Gun from Shintaro’s sword, saving his life. As shown, Somi herself is greatly preplexed by her maternal love and instincts, with her actively wondering why she felt such a strong urge to protect Gun when she had only had him to use as a tool for her and her family’s ambitions. In the end of her life, Somi eventually realized that like Shingen, she truly did care for and love her son and did not regret sacrificing herself to protect him.
Relationships
Gun Park
Somi Park's relationship with her son, Gun Park, was built on strict discipline and high expectations. She saw him as the hope of the Yamazaki Family and refused to let him engage in leisure until he was given a proper name by Yamazaki Shingen. Her harsh parenting shaped Gun into a ruthless fighter, conditioning him to suppress emotions and prioritize strength. Despite this, she ultimately proved her love for him by sacrificing herself to save him from Shintaro Yamazaki’s attack. Her death deeply impacted Gun, triggering his true Ultra Instinct.
Yamazaki Shingen
Somi was one of the eight women selected to bear a child for Yamazaki Shingen, the powerful leader of the Yamazaki Clan. She harbored feelings for him but, like the others, was forced to sever her left pinky as a sign of her commitment. Her loyalty to Shingen was unwavering, and she raised Gun with the sole purpose of making him worthy of his lineage. While it is unclear how deep her personal connection with Shingen was, she dedicated her life to ensuring his legacy through Gun.

Trivia
Somi was shown to have been deeply disliked and hated by Shingen’s other Concubines. Due to Gun being the only one of Shingen’s children to inherit the Yamazaki’s clan’s “
Reverse Eyes
”, the other children he had fathered were treated like they never existed by the rest of the clan.  Causing their mothers to frequently harass her in their frustration.
It was confirmed by Shingen’s other concubines that Somi also had Korean blood. It was later clarified that the “Park Family” was vassal yakuza family sworn to the Yamazaki. However, due to their Korean Blood, their standing amongst the rest of the syndicate was not high, nor were they respected much by the other vassal families. It was only with Somi’s actions in becoming Shingen’s concubine and bearing Gun and later marrying Shintaro and becoming the official legal wife of the Yamazaki, was her family properly acknowledged and treated rightfully.
Unlike typical mothers, she raised Gun Park with extreme discipline, refusing to let him play or act like a normal child. Her methods contributed to Gun’s cold and calculating nature.
