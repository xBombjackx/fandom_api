Summary
Goo knocks out Logan and tells him to not cause any trouble. They have a stare down and Logan leaves. Jake tells Goo he can’t take Vivi and Xiaolong. Goo asks if he can put a pause on his revenge scheme since there will be a war soon. He asks Jake to let him go just this once, and Jake begrudgingly obliges.
Vasco wakes up and is disappointed in his loss, vowing to be the main character next time. Zack is also depressed from his loss, and the fact that he cannot help his friend. He is filled with grief and his chest starts feeling hot. Samuel walks to Jake and asks if he still wants information from Vivi. Jake says Goo already left, but Samuel mentions there’s a basement in Club Vivi that only the executives can go to. He says Jake can still meet Sinu if he wants.
