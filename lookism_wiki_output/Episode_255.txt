Summary
The guys and girls are on the train to Cheongliang when the girls catch the eye of a small crew in Cheongliang, who are also a bunch of perverts. They want to approach the girls but cannot because they are sitting with
Daniel
and
Zack
. As they enjoy the ride Daniel realizes how much he missed not having to fight.
In another compartment
Jace
and
Vasco
are seated on the train, but in different compartments. They are on a mission to get information on Hostel's branch operation in Cheongliang. A girl comes to sit next to Jace and offers him candy. He tries to ignore her but he eventually falls for her.
The train perverts make their way over and begin harassing the gang, first by spilling Coca-Cola on Zack. He gets up to fight but is reprimanded by Daniel and decides not to. They are intimidated by Vasco, who tells them to fuck off. The perverts return to their leader Matt Kang and warn him of the gangster they just met (Vasco).
On a pit stop Vasco gets down to eat some sausage bars. He buys two for himself and Jace, but he took a lot of time and misses the train. Jace does not notice until his seatmate points it out. He tells Vasco to not to worry about the missed train, and that he will meet him at the destination they decided. Vasco yells at him to notice that the girl he is seated with has a tattoo of an 'h' on her wrist, and is therefore a member of Hostel.
