Summary
Jin Jang
begins spreading rumors in
J high
about who is the best fighter. He learns that
Daniel
is the strongest but that
Zack
is determined to beat him. He believes
Logan
is stronger than
Vasco
but the
Burn Knuckles
protest that nobody is stronger than him. He learns that
Jay
and
Eli
are not fans of fighting and fails to mention Vin or Mary, which triggers Vin.
In the bathroom Jin is preparing what to do with this information when he is approached by
Jace
, who tells him he knows why Jin came. Jin reveals that he is not yet done with his analysis as he has yet to analyze Jay or Eli. He set up an ambush for both of them using the
God Dog
OBs; Eli is stopped by the Park brothers and Jay is stopped by Scott Kwon and Dominic Min.
