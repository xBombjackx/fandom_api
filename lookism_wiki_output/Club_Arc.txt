Synopsis
Episode 325
Daniel has lost a lot of weight since training with
Sophia
and he is starting to see positive results. As he is stepping out of the house he smells soap in the air, and a girl his age passes by.
Doo Lee and Alexander Hwang are getting yelled at for talking too much while working. Doo was taken from the fourth affiliate to work in the third affiliate's cleanup crew. Alexander was sent to the third affiliate to do odd jobs after being taken by
Tom Lee
. Daniel runs into them crying on the road and decides to buy them some fried chicken. He is reminded of
Like What
and
Hilarious
and sees one of the waitresses being harassed by her boss. Daniel intercepts the boss as he tries to grab the girl, and the boss moves away. He tells the girl she should try making money in other avenues, and that he knows a guy (himself) who made it large using TikTacTok.
Johan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers. Daniel hands Jake his ID, which says he is 90 years old. Jake tells Daniel minors aren't allowed inside, and Daniel reveals his black VVIP badge.
Episode 326
Jake believes Daniel must know something about
Sinu Han
since he is a VVIP. He tries to send a signal by sneezing, and Daniel doesn't understand but tries to send his own signals asking about drugs and secrets of the third affiliate.
Vivi's friends Antonio, Michael and Jonathan ask her why she is working in the club, and she tells them about how difficult it is to sell and use drugs in China compared to Korea. They ask her about her other drug business, Pungsan. Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
Jake and Daniel are finding it difficult to tease information out of each other. Jake gives up and asks Daniel to ask the president about Sinu Han if he sees them, because Sinu is his long lost brother. Daniel says he will, and they go to ask Xiaolong to see the president since he is a VVIP. Vivi and her friends are high in a room lined with mushrooms, so Xiaolong denies them. Daniel says he'll report this to the Workers and Xiaolong grabs him by the neck, saying he doesn't care if Daniel is a VVIP or not, he can always go back to China. Daniel escapes the choke and asks Xiaolong if there are drugs inside that room.
Episode 327
Xiaolong considers killing Daniel, and that it would bring a lot of trouble. He eventually lets Daniel and Jake inside the room, which is now completely empty. They search but they don't find any trace of drugs or Sinu. Daniel suspects a secret room is inside there. Alexander Hwang tells him that Vivi only meets with the super rich and influential, so it will be difficult to talk with her. He asks why Daniel is acting poor when he can pay with his black badge. Daniel starts paying for everyone's drinks and the club starts getting wild.
Johan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him. All of the expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol asks Daniel to come to the president. He comes to a room with several influencers sitting around sweets, along with TikTacTok girl. He eats some of the cookies and asks them where the drugs are, and they tell him that he just ate the drugs: Vivi bakes them into cookies called "Vivi cookies". Daniel faints and wakes up in his second body that he rushes into the club with.
Episode 328
TikTacTok girl tries help Daniel but everyone around her is drunk. Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and orders her to get wasted as well. Daniel enters the room to find it's emptied out. Xiaolong tells Daniel he was expecting him to attack the third affiliate, and Jake knocks him out despite taking a heavy blow from Daniel.
Daniel wakes up in a hotel room where Vivi asks if he's okay. He asks why she cares about him and she tells him her dad said to befriend any billionaire's kid, so she can make friends. When he asks about TikTacTok girl Vivi says if he likes her he can be a part of the treasure hunt she set up with her friends. These rich kids invite influencers they fancy so they can assault them while they are unconscious. Daniel beats the guys and raises his fist at Vivi in anger when Taegon Wi, another Workers executive, throws a kunai at him. The other kids' guards rush in to say that Daniel isn't the son of a billionaire, but an unknown person. Daniel says the third affiliate is rejected from the four crews.
Episode 329
Taegon Wi, also known as "King Gon", had fought with
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
before. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it. He chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.
Jake tells Daniel that he is in the VIP room where they grow hallucinogenic mushrooms, what he suspects is the third affiliate's illegal activity. He also tells Daniel that he found out the secret of the room while Alexander was flipping tables: that the room itself rotates. Daniel tells Jake that in the rooms above the club influencers are drugged and taken advantage of. He begs Jake to save them and Jake says he doesn't care, he is only interested in finding Sinu. He switches off with Johan as bouncer but starts to remember Daniel's words. He calls Big Deal and asks them to send two people over, knowing Sinu would have probably wanted that. Jake and Lineman show up to the club.
