Seoul, the land where
monsters
fight.
The
Four
Major Crews
are the four biggest gangs in Seoul divided by the Han River into five regions: North, West, East, and South. 3 years prior to
Daniel
coming to Seoul and entering
J High
,
Gun
with the assistance of
Goo
under the plan created by the
Ten Geniuses
, would seek out four of the largest pre-established gangs in order to turn them into the four major crews, each tasked to make at least a hundred million won a month. The purpose of these crews was to employ minors to earn money in order to help
Charles Choi
kickstart his business, with the only condition being that they couldn't earn the money through illegal means as that would jeopardize his reputation. 3 out of the 4 crew heads became Gun's successors, with the goal being that one of his successors would unite the four crews under their leadership, earning them immense money and status, but none have been able to do so yet.
3 years into the existence of the Four Major Crews, Charles Choi had become a pretty influential person in South Korea however he started to get paranoid that his criminal past would come back to bite him later, and the Four Major Crews were no exception. He would try and get rid of all evidence by getting Gun and Goo to denounce the Four Major Crews while catching them in the act of illegal practices, buying out businesses that have direct criminal ties to him and even murdering people from his past that posed a threat to his status. However despite his efforts, the last Four of the Major Crews still stands,
Workers
.
History
See article:
2nd Generation
Both Gun and Goo sought successors for their business in the meantime, scouring Seoul for suitable candidates. Eventually Gun had to retire from the business and become Crystal's bodyguard, leaving Goo to collect the money by himself.
Uniting the four crews is a task given by Gun to candidates he considers worthy of becoming his successor. Gun not only makes an insane amount of money, he also has a lot of influence due to his wealth. As a result, many people are vying for his and Goo's position. Gun's only rule for someone to be a successor is that they do not engage in illegal activity, because that may get him into legal trouble. Goo has not given this task to anyone.
Gun's first candidate for the job was
Eli Jang
, but he quit the crew business and disqualified himself. His second candidate was
Jake Kim
, but he was disqualified due to the illegal betting ring.
Johan Seong
was the third candidate, disqualified due to poor leadership and fake bank accounts. Gun has since offered candidacy to
Daniel Park
and
Zack Lee
, but both have refused on grounds of principle.
Organization
The Four Major Crews have their own jurisdictions on all four sides of Seoul, with central Seoul remaining neutral. Each gang is responsible for paying a Hundred Million won (86,000 USD) as a monthly fee. While they were encouraged to earn their money through legal methods, illegal methods were expected and quietly allowed as long as they weren't caught. The four crews are divided as follows.
Central Seoul:
Burn Knuckles
,
J High School
, and
Allied
While they aren't considered part of the Four Major; Burn Knuckles, and J High were considered a big threat enough to keep the Four Major crews from taking over Central Seoul completely.
The Burn Knuckles was founded by
Vasco
during his first year in high school, he would go around grabbing delinquents with his shoulder grip, warning them to stop smoking. The delinquents were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department in order to join him, eventually forming the Burn Knuckles. Vasco would indirectly recruit all potential delinquents who could have joined any of the four major crews and would transform them into protectors of the weak. They would protect Central Seoul from foreign gangs, thus keeping Central Seoul in neutral territory.
Due to the number of students who know martial arts, J High School would occasionally aid Burn Knuckles in their fight against the Four Major Crews. Unlike Burn Knuckles, the fighters from J High are not organized and only get involved when they personally get caught in the crossfire. While members like Big Daniel and Zack were always ready to jump into conflict when their friends were in danger, members like Vin Jin and Logan would only join the fight if it personally benefitted them. The only time J High would truly be untied was in their battle against
Hostel A
.
With the end of the
Hunt for Big Deal
and the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the Four Major Crews, Little Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers continue to grow in power and finally decided to create an organized force to combat them, a crew. He founded Allied with only one goal, the collapse and eventual eradication of Workers. When the group was formed, he approached multiple people to join his cause.
Vasco
quickly accepted the offer, bringing alongside the tactician
Jace Park
and the manpower of
Burn Knuckles
.
Zack Lee
, fresh from being trained at the Buddhist temple, joined alongside Vasco.
Jay Hong
joined the group to assist Little Daniel in finding the Big Daniel and
Hudson Ahn
joined in order to confront and get revenge on
Eli Jang
. These were the original five members and eventually more people would join.
North:
God Dog
(Gangbuk)
Before Johan entered the picture, the Gangbuk region was ruled over by
K-House
, a crew run by
Jin Jang
whose main business is fake bank accounts. They would rule undisturbed until
Johan Seong
appeared, he wanted to rule over this region to impress Gun and become his successor. It was the only way to get on
Charles Choi's
good side and get his mom her surgery. He defeated every grew in Gangbuk by himself and K-house was no different. After his takeover, he would change its name to God Dog, creating a new crew out of the collection of various Gangbuk crews he defeated in the past.
This was the second of the Four Major Crews Burn Knuckles and J High came face to face with and by far God Dog was the weakest, while they had the manpower, the crew had weak leadership. No one saw Johan as their leader but they still followed his orders as he maintained his leadership through fear and intimidation.
Jin Jang
would become second in command and was responsible for collecting the money and maintaining the headcount of the God Dogs. He would look loyal to Johan on the outside but behind closed doors he would use this position of power to create a coup of people who wanted to overthrow Johan as they hated being under his leadership, this coup would mainly contain members of K-House who wanted to be their own separate gang once again.
Johan would try and stop his gang from earning money through scams, as illegal activity would ruin his chances as
Gun
's successor. This would be God Dog's downfall as during the climax of the
God Dog Arc
, the problems of poor leadership would finally shine through. The moment he commands his men to fight Burn Knuckles, he is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. While Burn Knuckles and J High are shocked, God Dog laughs at Johan in his weak state. He asks his crew why they betrayed him, and Jin explains that they never liked him to start with. They only they waited this long just to get revenge on the Burn Knuckles and now they didn't need him anymore.  They try and cripple Johan, but he gets up quickly and starts to absolutely sherd his old crew, claiming that he would destroy the God Dogs and the Burn Knuckles and make a new crew. Before he gets a chance to beat down Jin, Gun comes out of the shadows and tells Johan that he is disqualified from the Four Major Crews and his successor due to his poor leadership. Not only was he unable to stop them from continuing illegal business but there wasn't any trust and could have turned on him at any moment. Johan begs Gun to reconsider but Gun refuses to, telling Johan he had his chance. As Johan starts crying for his mother and Gun warns him not to turn out like Jake, but like he did in the past, Johan becomes desperate and decides to fight Gun.  During the fight, Gun notices how much Johan has improved, with his only weakness being that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with one punch.
As Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him, He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out of the way by Zack. While the J high trio stepped in to protect Johan from Gun, Johan didn't have any interest in thanking them and disappeared. Since then, most former members returned to
K House
, some tried joining Big Deal and some joined
Hostel
A. Eventually, all of them would be absorbed into
Workers
under
Samuel Seo
's Fourth Affiliate. Johan Seong still calls himself a God Dog, although some say that he was the only God Dog to exist as he was the only one who believed in his ideals. After the gang's collapse, he refused the position of being the Ruler of Gangbuk, without being a successor of Gun, ruling over it would be pointless. This makes Gangbuk the only region in Seoul that is not ruled over by an overarching gang, due to this empty position, most small gangs that went into hiding due to Johan now came out of the shadows trying to get leadership to rule over Gangbuk. This conflict would escalate all the way into becoming another PTJ comic,
Questism
.
West:
Big Deal
(Gangseo)
Big Deal is most likely the oldest of the four major crews as it has a history in Gangseo with multiple heads. Not much is known about their origins but they were seen as just another gang, that was until "The Boy of Promise"  Sinu Han joined the gang. Due to his dedication and devotion to protecting the street that took him in, he joined
Big Deal
in order to rise up the ranks and become the new "Big Boss" and use the gang to protect the street. He would eventually accomplish that and took over the gang, he would make some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.
Their main business is an illegal betting ring. Jake's actions in the illegal betting arc led to him being locked up at a juvenile detention center, along with many other important members of Big Deal, but they were eventually released later on in the story.

Hostel
(Gangdong)

Darius Hong

At the time of Chapter 149 Hostel was in the middle of a major makeover, but they were considered "the worst criminals".
