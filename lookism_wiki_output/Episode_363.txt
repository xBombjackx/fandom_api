Summary
Jiho
asks
Hudson
what took him so long, and he mentions having left
Daniel
to
Darius
. He also says
the King
will be approaching soon, his senior. A crew member bursts in to say Daniel is loose and attacking the second floor.
Jacky
is leaving the girls' dorm when he runs into
Zack
, looking for
Channing
. He tells Zack to not be a sorry loser and Zack decides to fight him, saying he never lost.
Warren
learns from
Max
and
Derrick
that the reason they lost is that they underestimated Jacky. He is incredibly fast and flexible, as well as powerful. Jacky tells Zack that despite being a lower rank than Channing, he is more powerful than he is.
He kicks Zack into a car and Zack wonders aloud how he could lose this easily to these gangsters when he was doing so well against
Mandeok
. Jacky tells him he isn’t talented, and he should try something other than fighting. Zack is triggered and grabs Jacky, slamming him into a car. Jacky tries to escape but he is trapped within the metal folds Zack caused when he slammed him in there. Zack starts punching him in the face as Jacky begs for mercy before he passes out. Zack is satisfied he lost against someone stronger than Channing.
Vasco
comes to the location that was tattooed on
Jace’s
body. Channing asks him if he is scared of needles, and Vasco tells him to not bother him since he is going to die soon.
