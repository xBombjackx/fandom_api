Animal Instinct
is a wild mannered fighting style created by
Tom Lee
in the
0th Generation
that involves the fighter to battle without thought and only rely on instinct; as when a fighter starts thinking in battle, they lose their animal instinct. By relying on ones instincts, tools from the surrounding are often utilized to give the fighter an advantage.
Explanation
This is a martial arts style that focuses on using every part of the body and weapons to give the fighter an advantage in battle. Users will often use tools like fire extinguishers, necklaces, baton, etc. The use of weapons also means that this fighting style is designed to maim or straight up kill their opponents.
Animal Instinct targets weak points of the body like the eyes and crotch, making this a particularly immoral fighting style. A large aspect that makes animal instinct so dangerous and effective are the unpredictability elements that makes it tough to block or decipher the fighter's attacks. The user allows their instincts to guide their actions over using their brain, though this does mean that the user has to train their instincts to mimic those of animals.
