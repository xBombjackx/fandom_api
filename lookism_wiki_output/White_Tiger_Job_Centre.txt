The White Tiger are mercenaries for hire, willing to do anything for the right price. These activities can range from simple bodyguard duties to kidnapping, and even more. Their niche is locating people and places, no matter how hidden they may seem.
The White Tiger consists of "Departments", with the most capable members being appointed "Department Head", or "Manager", while others are "employees". Tom Lee sits on top of the ranks as "major-general".
