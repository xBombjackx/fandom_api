Relationships
Jace Park
Bum Jae is his best and most trusted friend. Bum Jae helped Euntae get over his fear of needles, by getting tattoos together, and even has a tattoo of his hero-man E.T. (Euntae). The duo is very close with each other and they often work out together.
Bum Jae seems to be a bit protective over Euntae, to the point of installing a lover app to track him and making sure that he does not get hurt or get into a big mess. The reason Bum Jae is so protective over Euntae maybe because he felt that he could never make up for the time he ditched Euntae back in middle school. However, this is not confirmed.
Euntae often asks for his advice either about the Burn Knuckles and even his personal life. Bum Jae is also vice-leader of Burn Knuckles, which shows how much Euntae trusts him. The duo are extremely close and their friendship is admired by many people.
Goo Kim
In the Lee Euntae Arc, when Euntae was being bullied, another boy who was getting bullied was a relative of
Goo Kim
and paid him to beat up the bullies. When Goo Kim arrives, he sees how much the bullies had hurt Euntae and says that this time will be free because, with an obvious victim, Goo Kim can do whatever he wants to them.
Euntae asks Goo Kim how he can get stronger, whose advise was to do one hundred push ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats, and a 10Â km run each day. This seems to be a reference One Punch Man, Episode 3.
