Brekdak
(
쁘랙딱
), (
สมศักดิ์ คำแสง, Somsak Kamsaeng)
is a supporting character. He is an immigrant worker from Thailand resigned to working many degrading jobs in order to pay off his debt and provide for his family back home. However, at the same time, Brekdak is a Muay Thai champion with a highly decorated record whom retired after killing an opponent in the ring. Now, he is Vasco's Muay Thai teacher and runs various small businesses.
Appearance
Brekdak is an unassuming man of Thai descent. He possesses dark skin, short and spiky hair, and is of average height. Throughout the series, he is forced to wear a variety of clothing ranging from stereotypical Vietnamese attire to stylish clothing.
However, Brekdak without a shirt is revealed to possess highly developed musculature, notably having a very wide back.
Personality
Brekdak is a kind, unassuming man with a hard-working personality and distaste towards violence if it can be avoided. He is notably motivated primarily by his family and love of Muay Thai in all his endeavours, going so far as to allow himself to be degraded on a daily basis in order to earn money to support his family.
Fighting Prowess
Brekdak is implied to be the premier Muay Thai fighter in the world, despite being retired. His prowess is such that he is not only acknowledged by
Gun
, but has Gun as his fan.
Due to his tutelage of Vasco, it can be assumed that all of Vasco's current techniques is comparable or even inferior to Brekdak's with many of Brekdak's personal and "Forbidden Techniques" being among the more powerful techniques in Lookism.

Trivia
Brekdak's original name neither recognizes by Thai readers nor sounds like one at all. Instead, in the Thai translation, he is given a new full name, สมศักดิ์ คำแสง (Somsak Kamsaeng).
His name is a parody of Thai kickboxing champion
Somluck Kamsing
, while his appearance resembles another Muay Thai fighter,
Buakaw Banchamek
.
Gun
is a fan of Brekdak, breaking his egotistical and sadistic persona to show reverance for and ask for Brekdak's autograph when the two met.
Many of Brekdak's "Forbidden Techniques" resemble techniques from Muay Boran rather than Muay Thai with Muay Boran being the primogenitor of Muay Thai exclusively based in military applications.
This is evidenced by many of the techniques utilising movements which are much more acrobatic in nature along with targeting areas of the body with the intent of murdering or disabling the opponent such as elbowing to the neck.
Brekdak's most common businesses involve selling food. In particular, he has sold Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food.
