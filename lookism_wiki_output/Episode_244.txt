Jake explains to Jerry that Big Deal's leader tried to sell their crew to the Workers and he is fighting for their right to remain independent. Old Face tries to convince Jake to give up and allow themselves to be run by the Workers. Jerry takes Jake's side and Big Deal's YB group appear. They ask why Jake is fighting against the boss and decide to take his side as well. Jerry and the YB group decide to fight the mutinous members of Big Deal and Jake defeats the leader, becoming the leader of Big Deal.
Back at Sally's house Eli gets a haircut from Heather. He confesses his love for her and she tells him to continue to smile, even when life gets difficult. The boys renovate the building and decorate it to surprise Sally when she comes back. Heather and Eli decide to spend the night together at Sally's place.
When Eli and Heather wake up they see a scene of chaos. Sally's orphaned friends are returned to the orphanage and Sally's home is destroyed. Eli notices an officer glaring at them, and Heather realizes that this is her mother.
