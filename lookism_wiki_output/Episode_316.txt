Summary
Gun and Goo make a bet for 10 billion won on who will win. Gun bets on Gapryong's son, who is incredibly strong, and Goo bets on Olly Wang, who cannot feel pain. Johan attacks Jake first, and he is surprised that Johan is the same kid who came to Big Deal. Jake tells Johan that he is too kind to join a gang, and he should return home. Johan asks Jake to bet that whoever loses gives their territory to the winner of the fight. Olly quickly dispatches of Samuel and tries to beat the other two, but they ignore him and fight each other.
Samuel is wondering why he lost so hard. Everyone he looked down upon is stronger than him; Johan who was a crybaby, Olly who was a loser, and Jake who he thought was beneath him. Goo goes to take a picture to show Gun who won the fight, and the scene he sees shocks him. Samuel has already beaten Johan and Jake, and he strangles Olly until he passes out. Goo asks why Samuel wants to Gun to approve of him so badly. He already approves of Samuel, and asks that he become his new secret friend.
