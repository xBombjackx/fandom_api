Appearance
Original Body
In her original "attractive" body, Crystal possesses unrivaled beauty within the series and this, coupled with her status as the HNH chairman's daughter, is usually enough to mark her reputation and status of importance as well above others. Even
Aru Lee
, a famous idol star, couldn't help but feel jealousy towards the difference in their status as
DG
diligently attended to Crystal's every need, yet wouldn't even bat an eye for Aru.

Crystal is also fairly tall in this body, with a curvy physique. Ever since Crystal drastically transformed from her past overweight self, she became the sexiest, hottest and most gorgeous girl in the country. So immensely beautiful and attractive that she could have any guy in the country if she wanted.
Crystal keeping track of her unhealthy diet.
In Chapter 60, Crystal recounts her journey from feeling overlooked and unattractive due to her weight and says that she could never imagine being treated with kindness and admiration in the past as she experiences them when she drastically changes and becomes very attractive. This shift has left her skeptical of people's motives when they treat her humanely and kindly. She reveals the extreme lengths she went to in order to transform herself citing that she “almost killed herself to change”, admitting to contemplating drastic measures. Her meticulous tracking of calorie intake and strict adherence to a potentially unhealthy diet regimen underscore the lengths she goes to maintain her current appearance. Crystal wishes she didn’t have to endure a hellish life all over again as she ventures on to keep an eye on Daniel through her alternate, unattractive body, as per her father’s orders.
Crystal has an immensely good fashion sense, in direct contrast with Daniel, who has terrible fashion sense and only maintains his stunningly fashionable looks with the help of
Jay Hong
.

Crystal is very knowledgeable in fashion, even schooling Daniel when she was annoyed at his poor fashion sense despite him being in the fashion department. Crystal seems to prefer dressing in style while in her original attractive body, which may be why she assumed Park Daniel did the same as well (when she was suspicious of him having two bodies). She generally uses this body to attend business related events and issues. Crystal works out quite a lot to maintain this body rather than the unattractive body which indicates that this is her real body.
Alternate Body
In her “unattractive” alternate body, Crystal is strikingly similar to
Daniel Park
in his original body (before he lost weight), to the point that it's as if she was the female version of him. Crystal is obese and quite short in this form, approximately the same height as Daniel in the past. Much like Daniel, she is also referred to as 'Pig' by many people due to her size and height; usually girls who are jealous of her getting attention from Daniel in his second body.
Crystal recounts her exhaustive efforts to alter her physical appearance in this body through all sorts of diets and workout regimens. She was unsuccessful at losing even a bit of weight, henceforth implying that this her alternate body.
She has been shown to have a prowess in fighting while in this body as well, as she is seen beating up some bullies during the Picnic Arc in Chapter 144. She has also used the two body system to cheat on exams to get high marks; however, unlike Daniel, she seems to have no shame in using it this way. This could be due to the influence of her father, who shames Daniel for wasting his "gift".
Crystal mostly uses this body for school related events and issues to keep watch of Daniel.
Personality
Crystal's views of men around her.

Irrespective of what form she is in, Crystal harbors a prejudice towards attractive people, mostly due to how people used to treat her in her past when she was “unattractive” and overweight. She faces the same treatment in her alternate “unattractive” body (that she cannot change since it’s her second body) often being called her derogatory terms, being ostracized and bullied.
She developed a cynical outlook towards attractive people, due to how many times she has been humiliated by their fake kindness towards her Unattractive Body. This cynical outlook isn't just exclusive towards attractive people, it also extends towards all people in general—this is because Crystal is the daughter of
Charles Choi
, and as his daughter, Crystal has a lot of suitors due to her power and looks. As a result, she tends to generalize attractive people to be egotistical, and believe people to be shallow and superficial.
This belief and experiences led Crystal to close off her heart, finding comfort in being alone and genuinely not wanting to rely on other people. This belief also led to her initial distrust of Daniel, initially responding to his friendly actions with caution and politeness, and pushing him away from her because his presence and compassion towards her Unattractive Body at school is causing other girls to bully her.
Despite Crystal's prejudices and cynical outlook towards other people, she is a kind person at heart. She feeds and take care of
Enu
regularly alongside Daniel. She also helped them during the
Illegal Toto Arc
using her Attractive Body which surprised
Kouji
, stating that she had never bothered to help others before.

Crystal is slowly but surely maturing as she interacts more with Daniel and his clique and becoming less and less prejudiced.
Fighting Prowess
As
Charles Choi
’s daughter and under the protection of the likes of
Jong Gun
and previously
Goo Kim
, she does not have to fight very often, even though she has shown to be quite formidable in her own right. Gun, the training genius, has undertook her training. Although Crystal seems well versed in all sorts of martial arts-even showcasing Kyokushin Karate, Boxing as well as Aikido, and how she seems to quickly identify
Eli Jang
's moves and tries to find any correlation to the many martial arts she knows, it seems that she has only ever used and possibly learnt it for the sake of self-defence, which is the reason we are yet to see the extent of her full capabilities in combat.
However as she carries the blood of Charles Choi, or Elite, the Second-in-Command or the Underboss of Gapryong Kim’s Fist Gang in the Pre-Generation, she seems to have potential by her superior genes.
Original Body

At some point, Crystal was trained by
Jong Gun
on how to fight and is fully capable of taking care of herself.

The extent of her ability in combat has yet to be explored as she rarely ever has to fight in this body, but since she was trained by a legendary fighter it can be assumed she is a formidable fighter in her own right.
Crystal first fought when she beat and kicked Daniel’s stalker using
Jong Gun
’s training in the Stalker arc in Chapter 120
[

]
. Crystal was able to knock Daniel’s stalker who was wielding a taser, using a Kyokushin Karate kick.
Crystal has also showed enough strength to skillfully knock out Matt Kang, the boss of a small crew based in Cheonliang, for bothering her friends and herself, using the Corkscrew Blow and Gun’s Aikido move, during the Hostel Branch arc in Chapter 258

.
Alternate Body
Despite the hinderance of the height and weight of her alternative body, she is capable of doing jump kicks and was shown beating up three bullies in a bathroom for bothering Zoe, Mira and Yui during the Picnic arc in Chapter 144.
