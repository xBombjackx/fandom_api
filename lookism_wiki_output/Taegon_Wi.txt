Club Arc
Taegon Wi first appeared when Vivi explained to him the rape ring she hosts for her friends. Taegon threw a kunai at Daniel. Then he chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.

Taegon told Eli that he was waiting for a real fight in Korea,and he could have his badge if he wins. After some sparring, Taegon decides Eli is worthy of his staff, and he puts his nunchucks together. He bats Eli’s staff away but he grabs a frying pan instead. Taegon starts imagining his own victory before he returns to consciousness. He asks Eli how he could have lost when he was so miserable, and Eli says he must have been worse off than Taegon in that case.
Quotes
It’s so damn peaceful here
Strength is proportional to unhappiness. That’s what got me this far. Why couldn’t I beat you even though I was so miserable?
