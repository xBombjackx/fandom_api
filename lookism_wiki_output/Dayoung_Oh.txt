I, Gapryong Kim's disciple, am the sole King. Someone like me can't be fighting these nobodies.

— Dayoung Oh,
Episode 550
Dayoung Oh (오다영 Oh Dal Yeong)
was a minor antagonist in Lookism, he was the former King of Busan.
Appearance
Dayoung has pink hair, with a slightly prominent mouth and cheekbones.
In his youth, Dayoung had a messy bowl cut and wore jeans, sneakers, and a simple white shirt with a green vest. His appearance was that of someone who was humble or concerned.
After years, Dayoung changed completely, having a short haircut, with his hair pulled back and shaved at the corners. His attire also changed, wearing a dark gray suit, a tie with an animal-spot pattern, and a fur cloak. He is also often wearing a pair of expensive-framed glasses.
Personality
According to people in Busan, Dayoung was a helpful person with a "romantic fist." So much so that he caught the attention of
Gapryong Kim
, who made him his disciple.
However,
Jongnam Hwang
and
Yongpal Bae
began to manipulate him, and Dayoung gradually changed, to everyone's surprise, perhaps revealing his true repressed side. Thus, Dayoung Oh is vain, selfish, a liar, sadistic, and violently arrogant to everyone except Jongnam Hwang and Yongpal Bae, obeying them in most of their requests and suggestions, calling them "godfather".
Dayoung also seems to have a hollow pride, and he always needs to mention Gapryong Kim in any argument as an excuse to do whatever he wants.
Relationships
Gapryong Kim
Dayoung deeply respects Gapryong, even though he currently does absolutely nothing that made him worthy of being his disciple in the past.
Jongnam Hwang
and
Yongpal Bae
Since they were the ones who brought Dayoung's evil side to light, he respects and obeys them, having a nephew and godfather relationship.
Jinrang
,
Sang Baek
and
Jungseok Hwang
For a time, the three were bodyguards and Dayoung's people, who always abused them, using them as if they were dolls or objects to pass the time.
Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
As a disciple of Gapryong, Dayoung is familiar with his fighting style, and uses it sparingly. He is arguably stronger than many members of the 0th Generation, but he still lacks much focus and attention, as Dayoung is always arrogantly carefree and with his guard down.
