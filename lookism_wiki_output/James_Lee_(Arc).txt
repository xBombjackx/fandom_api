Synopsis
Episode 354
Zack
and
Vasco
ask
Daniel
why he disappeared with the Workers, and he is saved by
Zoe
telling him the teacher wants to see him. The teacher tells him that a student will come to the class, and it may cause issues in the class.
Hostel
ask
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
why they let Workers get away with using
Olly's name
for their meeting. Justin and Chuck apologize to Hostel for saying it was their fault Olly died, and that they run illegal errands for
the Workers
now. They wanted to meet with Hostel because they suspect that Olly Wang died partly because of the pills he was taking, pills they suspect came from the Workers. They offer to work as double agents to fill Hostel in on what is going on inside the Workers.
At Gangseo,
Jake
tells the highest members of
Big Deal
to not mess with Workers, and to relay that to the lower members.
Brad
asks Jake why they would work with such an immoral organization, and he apologizes for being a bad leader.
Jerry
asks Jake not to lie to them anymore, and that they want to share the burden Jake is holding on to. Jake decides to tell them the truth about
Sinu
.
At the school, Zoe and
Mira
ask Daniel why the teacher wanted to see him. Just then
the teacher
announces that a student will be coming in the class, that student being
Jiho Park
. He is on leave because his grandmother died, and he wanted to apologize to Daniel during his break.
Episode 355
Jiho
apologizes to
Daniel
for pushing him, blaming it on his insecurities. Before Daniel can get angry,
the teacher
thanks Jiho and tells the class he will be returning to prison shortly afterwards. Daniel wonders if Jiho has truly changed. As they are stepping out, Jiho asks the prison guard if he can use the bathroom. He runs into some old bullies from school, who harass him before he beats them and locks them in a stall. While he is washing his hands of their blood, Daniel approaches and asks him if he is truly sorry for what he did. Jiho tells him he would have been sorry if it were Daniel, but that he is not sorry for
James Lee
that was pushed. Driving back from school, the officer tells Jiho he will take him straight home. Jiho asks if he can meet someone and the officer obliges, saying he should make the most of his time outside of jail.
At the
Workers's
headquarters, Daniel asks
Eugene
when he can enter the second affiliate, but Eugene doesn't trust him yet. He upholds his end of the bargain and tells Daniel the story of James Lee and the History of Fists. James was from the first generation of gangsters, following pre-generation and before the second generation (the current one.) He was one of the most influential people of that era, but only people who were close to him know anything more than that. Daniel asks what would happen if someone else called him James Lee, and Eugene becomes stern and asks for more information.
Jiho approaches
Big Deal
and asks to see
Jake
. One of the gangsters looks down on him, so he stabs him in the eye with the man's cigarette. Jake comes out with the commotion and asks if Jiho did that. Jiho says he kept his promise to Jake, and Jake asks him again.
Episode 356
Jiho
tells him he did that and
Jake
slaps him, saying that the guy he attacked was weaker than him. Jiho tells Jake that he knows the reason he held onto him was so he could destroy the four crews. Jiho tells Jake that he has gotten help from
James Lee
of the first generation, and Jake tells him not to disappoint him. Jiho calls his officer saying he has nobody left to call.
At Gangnam,
Goo
and
Gun
are partying in costumes. Goo recalls that they used to party like that in Ansan as well, and Gun asks about the Ansan kids, who may have been a crew if they were in Seoul. In the Jung-gu district of Seoul, the
Ansan Public
gang arrive looking for James Lee. They enter a club and are unimpressed, except for
Jacky
who does not care. They chastise the girls, which brings the club owners running.
Hudson
explains that their club is terrible, and Jacky offers to teach the owners how to run a club. The men get offended and start fighting, but the Ansan crew defeats them easily. A newcomer arrives, and the Ansan crew welcomes James Lee.
Episode 357
Darius
kisses Hudson's hand and he realizes that his voice doesn't match the one on the phone.
Jacky
leaps on Darius's shoulders and asks if he can deal with the imposter and
Ethan Hwang
barges in, saying that they are looking for a leader. Darius explains that he works for
James Lee
and is representing him in his absence. He says James Lee wants to unite the crews, and he wants to team up with
Ansan
to do it. The team find is amusing, and give Darius three conditions: first, that they decide where to start the crew business. Second, that they take 50% of the profits. Third, that they get half of Seoul, since they are seniors of the first generation. Darius is unhappy with the deal but Ethan reminds him that Ansan and other crews are not at the same level as Seoul crews.
Jacky tries to lure runaways in Gangdong but
Max
and
Derrick
threaten to fight him.
Channing
comes to the Architecture department at
J High
and asks to see
Vasco
.
The Burn Knuckles
apologize for any misdoings he may have done and welcome him, but Channing only wants to see Vasco. He beats them and tattooes their bodies so Vasco will come.
Hudson
confronts
Johan
walking his dogs and asks him to give Gangbuk to him.
Episode 358
Johan tells Hudson he can have Gangbuk if he wants. He went to a doctor earlier who told him he was losing his eyesight in the same manner as his mother, and he should not exploit them. If he doesn't find treatment, he will go blind permanently.
Jiho asks the prison guard is he's heard of James Lee before, and the guard finds it amusing. He says it doesn't matter since he is going back to prison, and laments that he did not get to go to the funeral of his grandmother. Jiho admits to the prison cop that he lied about his grandmother's death: he got his friends to fake the paperwork. Darius blocks the windshield of the car and leaps off just before the prison guard drives into a truck. Jiho steps out and tells the prison guard he didn't do anything wrong, so he doesn't deserve to go back to prison.
Hudson has finished clearing out another karaoke club, one that he finds decent enough to run. The rest of Ansan Public arrive, waiting for James Lee to arrive. Jiho arrives with Darius and Ethan, calling himself James Lee.
Daniel is hanging out in DG's club that he owns. Daniel asks if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee.
Episode 359
Daniel asks how he knows about the two bodies, and DG tells he's known since the beginning. He then says he will tell Daniel both things eventually, but to pick what is most important to his goals now. Daniel decides to learn about James Lee.
DG tells him about the History of Fists. The 0th generation were the generation of fists. They were headed by
Gapryong Kim
, who was known as the "Legendary Fist". The crews at this time were called "fists", and the crew heads were called "bosses", and some of them DG claims Daniel might have known and met in person. When Gapryong became interested in politics most of his organization dissolved, although his ventures were unsuccessful. His followers became greedy and started the second generation, the generation of circles, or the generation of war. The older gangsters recruited students to fight their battles, and those students were called "circles". This time period was very bloody and violent, and it was ended by James Lee. He destroyed the conflict but then disappeared after completing his goal, leaving a lot of members of the first generation searching for him. James Lee then reappeared in Seoul as one of
Charles Choi's
geniuses
, and helped create the four big crews. He changed his face and mannerisms so people would not be able to find him. After explaining this, DG tells Daniel he is in danger because he is using James Lee's discarded identity, and the first generation will likely target him.
After announcing himself, Channing picks up Jiho and threatens to draw on him, and Jiho threatens to stab his eye with a toothpick. Jacky calms them down and Jiho tells Ansan Public that they need to stop pretending they care about James Lee, when they're only using his name as a reason to advance into Seoul territory. Hudson gives Jiho a score of 100 points and decides to listen to his offer. Jiho says he wants to start a crew called "James Lee". He can fill the members with Backdoor if Ansan will take care of the finances. Ansan reveals they want to start a private bar recruiting runaway kids from Gangdong. Channing will take care of the police and Jacky will take care of the workers. Jiho accepts and the James Lee crew is formed.
At J High, the students are discussing the news that Jiho was in an accident and escaped. Daniel and Zack talk about it when Eli comes in and annoucnes that Max and Derrick were attacked from James Lee, a guy who
Mr. Carpenter
knows well. Daniel mentions that Jiho might be involved in this matter, and Zack says if Jiho is involved, they also have to get involved.
Eugene in his hot ride calls DG and tells him about the news, and how troublesome it would be for someone to start a James Lee crew. He asks if Workers should take care of it, and DG says he can take care of it, even though he has a flight in a couple of hours. Eugene is skeptical of his abilities since it has been a while, but says it should be fine because DG is James Lee after all.
