Synopsis
Heather was a friend of
Sally Park
, and one of the few who knew she was an orphan. They used to go to cram school with
Olly Wang
. She became interested in Eli Jang and would visit him after school.
Heather fell in love with Eli while visiting him. She would encourage him to not steal and to be a happier person. She confided in him about her dream to become a hairdresser, and the two of them slept together as well. As a result of this, Heather became pregnant.
When Heather's mother came to bring her home she tried to tell Sally she didn't snitch, but Sally didn't want to hear it. She asked Olly to help her but he only made things worse, tricking her into thinking Eli wanted an abortion. Since she had nobody to confide in, she decided to go to a gynecology clinic when she suddenly went into labor. Unfortunately, she died during the incident.
After Heather's death Hostel broke apart.
Heather's mother
blamed Eli for her death, and he lied that he told Heather to abort her baby. The remaining members of Hostel grieved her death except Olly, who did not show remorse. Eli later became a hairdresser, so he could finish Heather's dream.
