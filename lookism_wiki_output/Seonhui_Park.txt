Trivia
Her full name was only disclosed in Chapter 433, more than 8 years after the beginning of the manhwa.
Its implied in Chapter 191 that Daniels mother might be seeing someone romantically. Having put on weight and using makeup. But we hear nothing about this person, leading to many coming to the conclusion that it was just a short term thing.
