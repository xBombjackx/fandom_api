Daniel
have no idea what is going on.
Seonong hides in a bathroom from a Burn Knuckle member. The guy slips and almost falls out the window and Seonong grabs him. When the others bust in they think he is trying to kill the guy. Seonong throws him away and leaps out the window.
As Seonong walks away he notices a flyer about quick money. He walks into an loan office and asks for money.
