Summary
The Gangseo alliance begin fighting with Jake's crew. Despite their small numbers, they are doing well for themselves. Jason Yoon is called Jeju's Crimson Stallion due to his fancy kicks, and Brad Lee is called Gangwon's Hippo because of how he locks onto opponents. They mistake Jerry for Jake's father, although Jerry is younger than Jake. None of the students want to get close to Jake and Samuel, who are throwing heavy punches at each other. Alexander tries to encourage Samuel to fight like his gangster father, and Jake mentions how he hates his father, who is also a gangster.
Amidst the fight the Black Bear crew pull up, and order the students to stop fighting. Most of the kids flee, except Jake's friends and Samuel and Alexander. The crew asks who they are, and they say they are from Big Deal, in an effort to appear tough.
