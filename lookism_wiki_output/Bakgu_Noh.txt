Relationships
Gapryong Kim
Former superior.
Jinyoung Park
Judging from the fact Bagku called Daniel Park "Young Master" while recognizing him as someone related to Jinyoung, and judging the fact he adressed Jinyoung as "Captain", it seems the two of them got along pretty well, and that Bagku respected and valued Jinyoung.
Charles Choi
Considering the fact that the guy Bagku referred to as "The Bastard" is presumably Charles, their relationship looks rather hostile.
Bakgu and Charles held a relationship of mutual ill-will, both desiring the downfall of the other. Bakgu's negative feelings were due to Charles covering up the murder of Gapryong Kim, their former superior, while Charles actively sought out Bakgu in order to silence him.
This hatred eventually culminated in a confrontation between the two, whereupon Bakgu was shot in the head and killed by Charles using Jichang's gun, before framing Bakgu himself for instigating the incident.
Jichang Kwak
After Jichang's retirement, he became committed to helping Bakgu get his revenge on Charles Choi, even going so far as to attempt to hold Charles off so Bakgu could secure the evidence that served as Charles' weakpoint. In the end though, this attempt ended in failure as Bakgu was lured back to the scene and killed by Charles Choi, Jichang himself dying soon after.

Daniel
and 1st Generation King
Kwak Jichang
's fight.
Judging from the fact that he successfully stopped the fight warding off attacks from UI mode Daniel and a 1st Generation King, Kwak Jichang, who belonged to the strongest among the first-generation kings. Since he showed such a performance even at his old age, it is very likely that he was a very great fighter in his prime.
