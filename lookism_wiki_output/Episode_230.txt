Summary
James is angry that Zack would punch him, because he thought they were friends. He prepares to kill him with a hammer but Jay saves him by putting a helmet on him. He puts the helmet on James and beats him
dizzy with his hammer. The uncles of Hostel attempt to fight again but they stop once they see James run off with the bus, claiming he will kill Zack if he sees him. They steal Jay's bike and run off, but Jay doesn't mind and gives Daniel and Zack Band-Aids to heal their injuries.
The runaway fam leaders are arrested and the identity theft is halted. Daniel returns to school, and notices that despite Jasmine being innocent, she hasn't returned yet. Jin Jang is upset at the state of the OBs, including Scott Kwon who tried to overthrow him.
