Summary
Eugene is playing a game of tennis with Mandeok and asks if Mandeok really wants to fight Big Deal especially since Mandeok hates fighting. But Mandeok still agrees.
Ryuhei is in front of
Mitsuki's
door and tells her that the Workers are planning to go after Big Deal and that the Second Affiliate has no choice but to join. Ryuhei tells Mitsuki that they will have to fight
Shiba Inu
again. Mitsuki comes out and tells Ryuhei to come back safe and sound.
Xiaolong visits the penthouse above club Vivi and reflects on the events that happened during the
third affiliate arc
and leaves.
The Big Deal members meet again, and Lua explains to them how after gathering information, there's nothing they can do to stop the Workers from going after Big Deal. Lua explains that it's going to be a struggle considering the Workers' numbers and how many powerful fighters they have on their side.
Jason
asks Jake if they should call
Sinu
, but it is revealed that Sinu and
Yeonhui
already left the street together, entrusting the street to Jake. Jake refuses telling them that Sinu has found happiness and that they need to leave him be. Jake leaves again to meet with someone he's been unable to meet.
Lower Big Deal members are discussing the news about Hostel being taken down and wondering if Big Deal is next. Jerry approaches them letting them know that if they're scared, they can run.
Brad
and Jason are staring across the ocean discussing the events. Jason asks Brad what he'll do if Big Deal disbands, but the two decide that they can't give up and that they need to show the Workers what they're made of.
Samuel and Eugene are then walking together in a parking garage. Eugene is surprised that Samuel was willing to take part in the hunt for Big Deal, but Samuel says he hasn't had a change of heart. Samuel has been gifted Eugene a car and Samuel is thankful.
Jake is then meeting with the person he's been unable to meet, and it is revealed that it is
Charles Choi
. Charles is then revealed to be
Elite
, a member of the
pre-generation
and Gapryong Kim's second in command. Jake introduces himself as Gapryong's son and the chapter ends where the two are about to discuss the
