Synopsis
Episode 266
This arc starts off with Eli Jang, a kid sold in an illegal adoption operation. His seller employs him in various scams to get money from the illegal adoption. Eli lives with his seller, a man he calls "Mr. Carpenter". He teaches him how to live on the streets and makes him behave violently towards strangers. This man is actually
Olly Wang
, who wants to create another version of Eli Jang, his old friend he is obsessed with. What little Eli wants the most is a family, so he obeys Olly's every command.
When Eli goes to rob a store he is stopped by
Eli Jang
from J high school. Little Eli snaps at Eli, and he is shocked to see the kid behaving just like he did when he was younger.
Episode 267
Eli brings his daughter
Yenna
to meet
Sally
and Warren. Sally tells Eli about Olly creating Hostel A and begs him to come back to Hostel. He refuses, because he has a daughter.
Jin Jang
prepares for his second stage of the plan, which involves
Jasmine
.
At school, Jasmine's father comes in and pleads for the kids to help find his daughter, saying someone told him they could help.
Jay
,
Daniel
and
Vasco
decide to go to Gangdong to search for Hostel, where Jasmine ran off to.
Zack
goes on his own and
Vin
and
Logan
go to destroy the pictures of
Mary
and
Zoe
. Eli shows up later with Warren after discovering Olly is turning little Eli into a criminal.
Jin believes Eli won't show up because he has a baby to take care of. He also doesn't think
Johan
will come, although
Jerry Kwon
worries about that. Hostel A send all their men to Gangdong to confront the J High kids, who plan to destroy
Hostel
.
Episode 268
All of the J High kids split in different directions. Vasco approaches Vin, who is torturing a kid for information. He tells him to stop being a bully and Vin gets angry and decides to fight Vasco. Logan spots Jay's motorbike and decides to steal it. He spots Logan and wants his motorbike back, so the two fight.
Zack is the first to find Jasmine, and he tells her to get ready. She tells him that she can't return home because her father sexually abuses her. Daniel interrupts them to tell Jasmine to come with him, but Zack refuses to allow him, and refuses to tell him her secret.
Jin Jang
explains that he spent time analyzing the J High kids. Together they are powerful enough to destroy Hostel, but their weakness is that they hate each other. He studied their pet peeves; Vasco hates bullies (Vin), Logan hates Daniel while Jay likes him, and Zack and Daniel are both very stubborn. Since they cannot agree on anything, they will end up destroying themselves.
Episode 269
Daniel realizes that Zack will not decide to let him through. He decides Zack is being unreasonable and tries to sucker punch him like before, but Zack stays in place.
Vin asks Vasco if he resents him for bullying Duke. He tells Vasco that Duke deserved to be bullied because he is poor, fat and ugly, and Vasco lunges at him. He throws Vasco onto the ground and traps him in an armbar. Vin reveals to Vasco that the reason he quit wrestling is because he was a sadistic kid who liked breaking people's bones.
Vasco overpowers Vin and sends him flying with one punch. He has learned how to fight from his time in the bear family, and has taken the mother bear to be his second master.
Episode 270
Vasco tells Vin to apologize and he will stop, but Vin refuses. Vasco brings out the red mongkol and the two begin fighting to the death.
Ivan Park
is watching in horror and notifies Jin Jang, who sets out to leave with Olly Wang.
Logan decides to run over Jay, but he kicks him off the bike. It swerves and explodes, causing Logan to get pissed off. Elsewhere,
Goo Kim
and
Gun
discuss Logan Lee, and Goo remarks that Logan's muscular build is the reason he wants him as a successor.
Jay is at a disadvantage but he does his best using Systema, a fighting technique he learned from his teacher as a child. He manages to hurt Logan enough to force him into choking Jay. Jay is about to tap out when Logan remarks he will hurt Daniel the same way. He feints like he is knocked out and grabs a red-hot exhaust pipe from his broken bike and holds it to Logan's back.
Logan releases Jay out of the pain. He is shocked to see Jay's hands are bleeding from the heat of his weapons. Elsewhere, Warren is in shock at how good Eli's fighting skills have become under Gun's training.
Episode 271
Logan is having a hard time fighting Jay due to his long range pipe attacks. He grabs his own pipe and heats it, and uses it to choke Jay. Jay retaliates and the two begin choking each other.
Hope Park
watches and relays this to Jin Jang, while Gun and Goo continue to talk about Logan.
Daniel is having a tough time fighting Zack. Zack reveals the reason he returned to fighting is because he couldn't beat Logan, but he is more intimidated by Daniel. After faking out Daniel with a punch, Zack decides to let him go. Daniel calls him back to fight and he copies his exact moves, using even stronger punches like Gun's. He decides to let go of Zack the same way he let go of him, and Zack gets angry. He leaps at Daniel, who is slow to block his moves. Zack gets encouraged and says he knows what Daniel's weakness is.
Elsewhere, Jin Jang comments that nobody is there to stop him. As he says this, Johan Seong arrives in Gangdong with
Eden
and
Miro
.
Episode 272
Olly and the Hostel A uncles have sent someone to deal with Eli and Warren when they arrive in Gangdong. Meanwhile, Daniel and Zack continue to fight. Zack feels overwhelmed by Daniel and wonders if he is a genius, because he isn't a natural fighter like Daniel and Johan. Daniel's weakness is that he doesn't have the willpower of a fighter, and that keeps Zack fighting as long as he can.
In jail,
Jake Kim
wonders how Jin Jang will fare against J High. He sent Jerry Kwon to deal with Zack and Daniel if Jin Jang needs assistance.
Episode 273
Vin and Vasco are approached by
James Gong
and MC Pesticides, who came to fight Vin. However the two of them ignore him, so he decides to fight both of them. Logan and Jay are also fighting when they are interrupted by
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
, who want to fight them when they are weak. Logan makes a deal with Jay and then knocks him out, deciding to fight them alone.
Daniel and Zack continue to fight, and they are evenly matched. When Daniel jumps at Zack he gets hit by both Zack and Jerry Kwon, who tried to ambush him. Zack and Jerry are surprised to see Daniel stand up while unconscious, and his eyes are black like Gun's.
Episode 274
Zack realizes they are in a trap and tries to take Daniel home, but he knocks him out the way. Daniel begins fighting Jerry. Jerry made a promise to himself the day Jake was disqualified that he would never lose another battle, but he loses easily to Daniel. When Daniel recovers from unconsciousness, Jerry decides to fight them with boxing.
Eli and Warren come across some Hostel members who have been stealing like Olly used to. Eli feels bad about it, and Warren tries to comfort him when Darius approaches them (he was released from prison before Jiho or Jake). He attacks Eli, who defeats him easily with aikido, before being stabbed by little Eli, who Olly sent to fight him.
Episode 275
Daniel and Zack lose to Jerry Kwon, who drags them to Hostel's headquarters, where everyone else is. Jin Jang explains that he set them up to be in Gangdong so he could humiliate them. The boys quickly recover and start fighting Hostel together.
Vasco expects Jace to come but he instead sends Johan to watch over the situation. The runaway kids are surprised to see Warren and Eli appear with capital H tattoos. When Eli appears, everyone falls silent and he asks to see Olly Wang.
Episode 276
Eli Jang has a flashback to when he stopped the kid from stabbing him. A few members of Hostel recognize Eli as the original head of Hostel. Warren and Jerry begin fighting until he is called back by Jin Jang, who wants to propose something to Warren, but Warren beats him for killing his vibe.
The other J High kids continue fighting but they are brutally exhausted. Olly knocks out Vasco and Jay and calls out Eli Jang, who is shocked to see Olly is happy to see him.
Episode 277
Warren Chae reveals the reason he was put in an orphanage was because his father killed his mother. He fights Olly and is surprised to see Olly does not feel pain from his attacks. Eli interferes and decides to beat Olly but is stopped by his legion of homeless kids, who he orders to attack Eli. Justin and Chuck attack Daniel and Jay, and Johan decides to enter the arena.
Episode 278
The Burn Knuckles arrive at the scene to support the J High kids, but they are all beaten by Justin and Chuck. Then two men come pushing a food truck towards the battle, and reveal themselves to be Max and Derrick. Johan left the fight once he learned they were on their way, and they quickly defeat the uncles of Hostel A.
Episode 279
Vin Jin beats MC Pesticides and leaves the battle, revealing his fighting style to be Kudo. Hostel B is surrounded by Olly's gang of children, but they are beaten by Logan Lee and they all scatter.
Olly beats both Max and Derrick, and reveals that he cannot feel pain. He then goes to fight Eli Jang, but he gets run over by James Gong's bus.
Episode 280
Jin Jang has a flashback where he learns James plans to betray Olly because he is annoyed by him. Olly was aware of this betrayal by both of them, and asks Jin Jang to grant him one last favor: to see Eli Jang one last time.
Hostel girl then betrays Jace and reveals she is Jin Jang's girlfriend, wearing a wig. Jin Jang sent Jerry Kwon away so he wouldn't learn he is reviving his old crew called K House. Back at Sally's house, Eli confront Olly to fight him.
Episode 281
Warren blocks the runaway fam from entering the fight, so Eli and Olly can fight in peace. Olly remembers how caged he felt in his middle school years, and how much he respected Eli for his freedom. He is disappointed that Eli is not stronger than him, but Eli gets back up and shows Olly he is still as strong as him.
Episode 282
Eli and Olly continue their fight on the roof. Goo asks Gun in a different location why he favored Eli, and he mentions his reckless and wild behavior. As Olly and Eli are equally matched, Olly reflects on why he wanted to see Eli; because Eli is the first person who made him feel fear. Olly has had to pretend to feel emotions for most of his life do to his condition. But now he does not feel it, because Eli is stronger than him.
Warren, Max and Derrick and Sally appear and Olly beats them all except for Sally. He asks her why he is unable to feel anything, and tries to hit her but Warren protects her. Olly sees Heather in Sally and realizes that what he felt wasn't fear of Eli, but guilt for what he had done to Heather. He becomes overwhelmed with grief and jumps off the roof to kill himself.
Episode 283
The people who knew Olly mourn his death. Chuck and Justin scatter his ashes at a riverside and burn the money they earned from Hostel B. They ask the little Eli what he will do. He eats Olly's ashes and says he was meant to be alone since he is an Eli. Johan observes the small funeral and says he didn't plan on coming, but he happened to be wearing black.
Jasmine and James are on the run again, this time with the abandoned kids Olly was raising. Jasmine sews jackets for them and is happy to play the mother, but James  is annoyed since Olly is dead. He decides to play the father.
In Japan, Gun expressed his condolences to Olly. Big Deal wears black for his funeral, and Jake lights a cigar under an umbrella. Jin Jang meets with a Workers member in a bar, who congratulates him on destroying Hostel. He offers Jin Jang a bronze badge, and he bows.
Hostel B meet at Heather's grave to let her know that they sent Olly off. Sally asks where it all went wrong and starts crying. When they arrive at the hotel, Eli tells them that he'd like to live with them. Gun is disappointed to hear this. The kids turn to see that he is holding Yenna.
Episode 284
Eli tries fighting Gun but he is overpowered easily.
Gun
explains to
Eli
that
Olly Wang
has been paying for their protection for years. He has decided to stop demanding money from
Hostel
as a last favor for Olly, because he has
Big Deal
and
Workers
to rely on. Eli relays all of this information to the gang at J High and tells them they should be careful dealing with Gun, because he doesn't want there to be any more tragedies.
Zack
remembers this as he visits
Johan's mother
, and swears he will bring him back home.
Jasmine's
father also grieves Jasmine's loss, hugging her blanket in a strange manner.
Meanwhile
Daniel
mulls over the tragedy of Hostel. He decides to investigate the secret of
James Lee
, and returns to his school. He finds that the school doors and not locked, and the trophy room is empty. In a dark classroom, he finds James's locker with his picture inside it. He also finds Gun waiting for him.
