Daniel asks Eugene when he will go to the 2nd affiliate, Eugene soon replies that he will visit the affiliate now, Eugene asks Daniel a question about which place can reveal the dark side of the human being, Eugene soon replies that no there's no right answer, but he believes that's where they are: a casino,
Lucky Casino
, the 2nd affiliate of the Workers.
Daniel gets excited and accidentally shouts with joy telling Eugene that he will expose the affiliate, but Eugene responds, saying that a casino for foreigners is allowed by the government, since the objective may be the acquisition of foreign currency, like the Seven Luck Casino or Paradise Casino, so Eugene shows Daniel Park that there are no illegalities in the affiliate, which affects Eugene's trust in Daniel Park.
Upon returning home, Daniel realizes and regrets his emotional attitude, and thinks how he could do to get into the 2nd affiliate now, he can think of a method to get into it again.

Sinu enters the arena. The last game is revealed to be catch-the-god, where to win, the players have to cooperate to defeat the God of Combat, Sinu Han. Vin Jin, Zack and Warren unite against Sinu, but Sinu remembers Big Deal, and is confused. He apologises to Mitsuki and decides finish the three of them as fast as possible. Meanwhile, Sally park knocks (Small)Daniel out with a frying pan, as per his request. (Big) Daniel then enters the arena, behind the Kitsune mask.
In a flashback, Hannya(Doo) hands the Kitsune mask and the workers badge to someone. (Big) Daniel Park appears and asks Doo how it went, and revealed that he was the one that told Doo to pass those items to the person going onstage. (Big) Daniel Park thanks Doo for doing his job, and says that the 2nd Affiliate is done for. In the same flashback, we see (Small)Daniel meet with Jake Kim before the circus began. Daniel tells Jake that he will be kidnapped by the 2nd Affiliate soon, and that Sinu Han will be there. Daniel asks Jake to go to the 2nd Affiliate under the Kitsune mask, and that the strategy for the last game is for Sinu to meet Jake.
Episode 384
Sinu does not recognise Jake, saying that he thought Jake died. He remembers Big Deal again and starts having a breakdown. Mitsuki sees this and ends the circus immediately.
Nomen(Ryuhei) escorts the masked VIPs outside, but worries for Mitsuki. While escorting them out, Warren finds him. Ryuhei decides to take up Warren's challenge as "It'll be a good reason to see [Mitsuki]" if he beats Warren.
Back at the arena, Zack has taken down all of Kenta's goons, he introduces himself as a classic boxer(while carrying chains behind his back). Kenta tells Zack not to die too fast after messing with the Magami Family.
Vin Jin has collected toilet paper and wants to find the exit to go home. He meets Hyottoko, who points him towards the exit. Vin thanks him, but Hyottoko throws him into a wall. Hyottoko is revealed to be Sato Kazuma.
Workers gather around Jake Kim, and Mitsuki questions him if Eugene knows about his actions, which violates the alliance that Big Deal and Workers have. She invites him to leave while its not too late. Jake says that he would have left if he saw Sinu happy, but seeing Sinu not recognise him, and him breaking down, he says he wants to talk to Sinu. Mitsuki then asks if Jake is not afraid of war, but is informed that Gangseo's Big Deal is on their way to the 2nd Affiliate. Jake says that he was never afraid of war, and that the only reason he joined the alliance was to find Sinu, he never liked Workers in the first place. He asks again to talk to Sinu, and if they wanted to stop him, he would kill them.
Episode 385
(Big) Daniel enters the arena that Jake is at, apologising to Mitsuki for letting his mask get stolen. He attacks Jake Kim to prove that he isn't a traitor to Workers.
Zack and Magami Kenta fight, Kenta's goons worry if he would lose, but one of them tells the rest to not lose faith in Kenta, because the Magami Family is still here.
In a flashback, Kenta's Father, Magami Ryuujo, was one of his idols. His other idol was Gun, from the Yamakazi Family. Gun was a genius who learned the Magami's Kyokushin Karate within a month. Ryuujo encourages his son that one day, he might be a sworn brother to Gun. Kenta trained hard, giving everything for his idols. However, Gun attacks the Magami Family and kills Kenta's Father. Kenta kneels before Gun, asking for mercy, and to pay the price instead of his family. Gun however, does not even know who Kenta is, saying that he does not remember the weak ones. Kenta cuts the pinkies of both his hands to pay the price. Gun insults him for not even standing against his father's killer but cutting off his own fingers. He says Kenta is simply not worth killing. This was the downfall of the Magami family.      Mitsuki visits Kenta in Japan, saying that he rebuilt the Magami Family all on his own. She invites him to Korea to help run the 2nd Affiliate, he only agrees to go after hearing that Gun is in Korea.
Kenta beats Zack, saying that the Magami's are still here.
Eugene says that the 1st and 2nd Affiliates have no concerns when it comes to strength. If Workers wanted to, the 4 Major Crews would have been united already. Eugene says he's surprised at Big Deal's action to potentially start a war in order to get Sinu Han back. Eugene decides to show Big Deal how much more powerful Workers are than them.
Episode 386
In a flashback, Ryuhei wants to play with Mitsuki, but she is finding more people to run the 2nd Affiliate with, as they don't have enough manpower with just them and Doo. Ryuhei suggests they hire Sekiwake(3rd highest rank in professional sumo wrestling) Sato Kazuma, who was an up-and-comer in the sumo world, but was later expelled from the sport. He then joined the Japanese self-defence forces (JSDF), but deserted both due to insubordination. He was on the run.
Sato Kazuma beats Vin Jin up, saying he hates people who run their mouth, and who say that they are stronger than they really are.
In a flashback, Sato Kazuma wins against his superior (in the JSDF) in a sumo match. He questioned how such an inferior man could be his superior. He pins his superior against a wall (and probably chokes him to death idk). He leaves the military base.     Mitsuki visits him after finding out the reason for his defiance, and invites him to South Korea because he can't stay in Japan anymore.
Vin Jin gets back up, and pins Sato against a wall. He grabs Sato by the collarbone and beats him up. He then grabs Sato by the balls and slams him into the ground. Vin then breaks his ribs, and all of his bones. After beating Sato, Vin finally gets to go home.
At the arena where Jake, Mitsuki, and (Big) Daniel were, Daniel and the goons of workers lie on the ground after being beaten by Jake. Jake meets up with the rest of Big Deal, who has taken time to make themselves presentable infront of Sinu Han. Big Deal open the doors to where Sinu is, revealing him lying on Mitsuki's thighs at the end of a room with lights, clothes, signs, and mannequins set to mimic Big Deal Street.
Episode 387
Warren begins to fight Ryuhei, but after hearing that Mitsuki is confronting Big Deal, rushes off to save her. Warren lets Ryuhei go, after seeing how desperate he was to protect the girl he likes.  Warren and Sally decide to go home together.
Sinu attacks Big Deal, mistaking Mitsuki for his Yeonhui. However, Big Deal assembles orderly and apologises to Sinu for being late and not being able to come sooner, and that they will not make any excuses. Jake takes the blame for not coming for him sooner. However, Sinu says that Mitsuki told him that some people pretending to be Jake (who he thinks is dead) would come for him. He continues his assault on Big Deal. Even though Big Deal tries to remind Sinu about the truth, he still thinks that that room is Big Deal street and that Mitsuki is Yeonhui. Jake gets up and punches Sinu before he can stomp on Brad, he reminds Sinu of what he said before he left Big Deal, that Jake had to become stronger in order to protect it.  We see the flashback of Sinu needing Jake to promise him to guide him back onto the right path if he makes a wrong decision. In the present, Jake tears up, finally being able to keep that promise.
Episode 388
Jake and Sinu fight. Sinu hits Jake with an attack that he cannot see.
In a flashback, Taesoo Ma calls the ability to attack unseen a type of Mastery. He explains that they attack their opponent's blind spots so quickly the attacks seem to be invisible. He says that only two people have reached this type of Mastery, Elite and James Lee. He also says that maybe one day, someone from the second generation may get there some day.
In the present, Sinu kicks Jake with those invisible attacks. Sinu beats Jake up, but before he can deal the finishing blow to him, Brad, Jason and Jerry step up to protect him. Sinu is confused and tells Mitsuki that he thinks something has gone wrong. Mitsuki responds that its all in his mind and that they are trying to confuse him. Sinu prepares to kick Jerry, but Jake is able to get up and block the blow.
Taesoo Ma then tells the reader that there was one person who could win even though he couldn't see his opponent's attacks. That person was Gapryong Kim.
Gapryong's son hits Sinu with an attack towards his blind eye, but he pauses before landing it and chooses to attack the side where Sinu can see from, exactly like the final fight that Jake and Sinu had before Sinu left Big Deal.  Someone throws the Sinu's coat containing the signatures of the women of Big Deal Street on Jake.
Sinu finally remembers the events Jake Kim arc.
Episode 389
Sinu cries for attacking Big Deal. Jake orders him to stand up for Bid Geal to greet him properly. Mitsuki rages from losing the control of Sinu.
In a flashback, in Japan, Mitsuki is revealed to have restored Lucky Pachinko Palor to its former glory after her father, who was a skirt chaser, almost destroyed it. Due to Mitsuki's hard work, Lucky Pachinko has received large success with many branches across Japan. However, her father's actions causes Mitsuki to detest men. She thinks men are irresponsible trash, selfish and don't know the meaning of sacrifice. Vivi barges into Mitsuki's office, asking her to go to Korea with her. In Korea, while Hotel ViVi is being contructed, Mitsuki meets Eugene. Eugene invites Mitsuki to the underground fighting arena in the 3rd Affiliate. While watching the players fight, she takes Intrest in Sinu. Eugene explains Sinu's story to her, and she decides to buy him off Eugene because she likes him a lot. Eugene refuses to sell Sinu, but offers Mitsuki to run the 2nd Affiliate of Workers
