She and Vin Jin came to Cheonliang when Vin was young, where she witnessed the horrors of the area's king, the Shaman, had on the people. She attempted to escape several times, but had her attempts blocked as everyone she interacted with was a follower of the shaman.
When Vin was nine, the girl she had doted on confessed she had witnessed one of the Shaman's assaults, who tried to reassure her by excusing it as a Judo. The next time she was called by the Shaman, she asked for him to stop, only for Shinmyung to intimidate her by saying it would only get worse for her son. This caused her to break into tears, asking what she did wrong, sending the Shaman into a rage as he begin to beat her.
