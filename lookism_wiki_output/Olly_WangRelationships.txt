Hostel
Eli Jang
Olly is obsessed with Eli and constantly seeks his attention. After the split of Hostel, he continues to look for Eli Jang and models Hostel A after his old club.
Heather
Olly had a grudge against Heather for taking away Eli's attention. He called her mother to take her away, but he did not expect the other members of Hostel to be removed as well. When Heather confided in Olly about her pregnancy, he pretended to be Eli and told her to get an abortion. Eli beat him viciously after he found out his deceit, and Olly grew even more resentful. However, it is later revealed that Olly felt tremendous guilt for causing Heather's death and regrets his actions deeply because he considered her his friend and the only one who truly understood what he was going through.
