Leonn and Vasco seem to have already known each other prior, Leonn even mentioning Vasco's promise to fight him. He says he wants to become like Vasco, perhaps looking up to him.
Leonn also seems to have a romantic interest in Vasco, due to his frustration from his blind date and even going as far as to work in the same place as Vasco.
