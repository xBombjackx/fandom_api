Summary
Daniel
reveals he tried to call police but they weren't very helpful and sent an officer. He called
Vasco
but forgot to give him directions. Vasco found him anyway by running around the neighborhood searching for
Zoe
. He easily overwhelms
the stalker
and brings him to the ground.
The stalker's father comes out and tries to defend him from Vasco. The stalker whines about his father embarrassing him and Daniel is reminded of his behavior towards his mother. When the man complains he cannot overcome being at the bottom Vasco tells him that he overcame it, and Daniel wonders about Vasco's backstory.
The man is arrested and sent to prison. Zoe stops streaming and gives her money to the man's disabled father. She starts having feelings for Daniel's fat body, which she denies. When Yui comes in Daniel is prepared to reject her, but she reveals she has fallen for Zack, angering Mira.
Zack
is walking home when he encounters Yong again, this time with the Gian High thugs. When
Mira
sees them she leaves Zack, and in a rage he defeats them all.
