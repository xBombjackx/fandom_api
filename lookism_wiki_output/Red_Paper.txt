To this this, Shinmyung counters with the Red Paper. Following the death of Shinmyung Cheon, Taejin takes over Cheonliang as its leader and Charles meets up with him. After some bold words from Taejin, Charles left with a smile as Taejin didn't know about the Red Paper. Taejin is then captured by
Goo Kim
, who under the orders of Charles Choi, was also sent to find the Red Paper. With Taejin out of the picture, Charles seems to have revisited Cheonliang to burn the Red Paper, figuring where Shinmyung hid it.
