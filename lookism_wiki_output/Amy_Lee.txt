Synopsis
Like What and Hilarious are two minor characters introduced in the Runaway Fam arc. They are called such because those are phrases they repeat all the time. However, Like What's real name is Amy and Hilarious is Natalie, this was revealed during the
Workers 4 Affiliates Arc
by
Warren Chae
.
Both of the girls used to live in dysfunctional families before running away. They joined Riley's runaway fam and committed prostitution scams to earn money for themselves.
Daniel saved them from their abusive leader and they were found by Sally and Warren, who employed them in a tteokbokki restaurant. The two of them have been taken care of by Hostel B ever since.
The girls are known to be very cute as they smile, and are known to be attractive, people from the streets couldn't believe that someone like them would run away from their homes selling stuff this way. One of the guys would even want to eat Tteokbokki for every meal because of these girls.
