Summary
A little girl asks Daniel if she's seen her dog
Miro
, who is pregnant. Daniel replies he hasn't and is surprised to see this is a thing that happens. A later scene shows Miro being thrown out by her kidnapper. Johan is ringing doors and asking people to call him. As he runs off, a shadowy figure watches him.
Daniel and Johan approach the animal feeders and they tell them about a creepy old man who carries garbage bags. Johan remembers the old man and fears his dog is in danger. He and Daniel head up the stairs, but the second floor is barred by an iron door. Johan blasts the door open with his strength and barges into the man's room. He and Daniel see the man leaping towards them in the dark.
