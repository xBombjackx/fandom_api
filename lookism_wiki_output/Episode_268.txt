Summary
All of the J High kids split in different directions. Vasco approaches Vin, who is torturing a kid for information. He tells him to stop being a bully and Vin gets angry and decides to fight Vasco. Logan spots Jay's motorbike and decides to steal it. He spots Logan and wants his motorbike back, so the two fight.
Zack is the first to find Jasmine, and he tells her to get ready. She tells him that she can't return home because her father sexually abuses her. Daniel interrupts them to tell Jasmine to come with him, but Zack refuses to allow him, and refuses to tell him her secret.
Jin Jang
explains that he spent time analyzing the J High kids. Together they are powerful enough to destroy Hostel, but their weakness is that they hate each other. He studied their pet peeves; Vasco hates bullies (Vin), Logan hates Daniel while Jay likes him, and Zack and Daniel are both very stubborn. Since they cannot agree on anything, they will end up destroying themselves.
