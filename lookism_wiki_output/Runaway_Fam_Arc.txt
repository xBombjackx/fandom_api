Synopsis
Episode 219
Zack
confronts the lawyer and tells him to beat it. He lets Jasmine go because she reminds him of
Jiho
, but tells her to never show her face around him again. At school her father comes looking for her and begs Mira to tell him where she is. Zack feels guilty about
Jasmine
, but tries to ignore it.
Doo
and his friends are laughing at a picture of
Mira
, causing Zack to examine it closer. An online account is claiming to sell Mira's stockings for a certain amount of money, and there are other accounts doing the same with
Joy
,
Zoe
and
Mary's
pictures. They head to the police station but they are unable to do anything about it. Daniel and Zack decide to catch the scammers themselves.
Jace
gathers them all at Zack's boxing ring and reveals he purchased a sample himself.
Vasco
decides to drink the sample and is disgusted to find out it is pee. The sample is from the eastern part of the river, implicating that Hostel is to blame.
Jace explaining the event
He explains the system of the runaway fams that sell the stockings using the pictures of the girls.
Daniel
decides to join a runaway fam and disguise himself as a rich runaway. Zack, Vasco,
Vin
and Mary also leave to find Hostel.
Episode 220
Some vloggers are making a video on runaway fams when they are attacked by
James Gong
, now a member of Moley's runaway fam. Moley worries that James will steal his authority so he shows him how to steal dolls from a vending machine. James rams his car into the machine to steal the entire thing, and Moley is shocked. The girls in the runaway fam reveal that they picked up a new member, who is Jasmine Huh.
Daniel meets two girls he calls
'Hilarious'
and
'Like What'
, because that is all they say. He asks the girls to take him to Hostel but they don't know what that is. He takes them out to eat and feels bad when he sees
Daniel and the girls
how hungry they are. He asks them how they earn their money and they refuse to tell him, because he is too innocent. He asks them to take him to their runaway fam, and they agree.
When Daniel gets to the house he is shocked to see how many people live there. The leader is Riley Oh, who greets him by throwing a bottle at his head. Riley tries to hit one of the girls for bringing Daniel but he grabs his arm. Riley orders his people to lock the door.
Episode 221
Zack beats up some Hostel members looking for Jasmine. Daniel is getting hazed by the leader of the runaway fam Riley Oh, who asks him to drink a disgusting liquid. Daniel drinks it despite the girls protesting, and is allowed into the family. When he later throws it up the girls reveal the reason they ran away from home was because they had unstable families.
The girls are called out by Riley who wants to use them for 'roleplaying'. He picks the inexperienced girl to go with him and Daniel tries to come along but he is told to stay behind. The other girl cries that she isn't ready for it yet, and Daniel asks what the fuss is about. He learns that Riley employs his girls in prostitution scams to earn money.
The girl's client is in a shower attempting to wash before their meeting. He comes out to find an angry Daniel telling him to piss off. As the man tries to run he is hit by Riley, who accuses Daniel of ruining everything. Daniel asks the girl If she wants to continue to live this way, and she reveals that she doesn't but she also doesn't have anywhere else to go. Daniel slaps Riley and tells him to prepare himself for a beating.
Episode 222

James takes his runaway fam to a funeral home to eat. They manage to steal the condolence money and escape, and Jasmine begins falling in love with James. Later Moley is driving with James to Hostel and James asks who he sells the stolen toy machines to. Moley tells him only dads with an 'h' tattoo can meet the man they sell it to, and James declares he wants one as well.
When they come to the meeting place James knocks out two men and uses their blood to draw him an h. He calls out the leader, and he comes crashing down on their car and introduces himself as
Olly Wang
, leader of Hostel A.
Episode 223
Olly decides to test James, thinking he showed up for the position of uncle. James fights Chuck and isn't as good a fighter, but he takes the hits well. He asks if he can use a doll as a weapon and knocks him out with a brick tied to the doll. He draws a star on his face and Olly is impressed by his creativity. Elsewhere, Daniel asks Riley how to contact Hostel and he tells him to text 'FR' into his personal phone. The FR stands for family recommendation, and he receives a message telling him where to go.
Olly introduces himself

Daniel realizes he fights too predictably and decides to fight like Gun.

Sally Park
and asks if they are Hostel. When they reveal that they are, he begins wrestling Warren.
Daniel is getting overwhelmed from his fight with the hostel uncles. They are desperate to win and prove that their methods are valid, because Olly Wang respects their fighting style. He is spared when Zack whacks the uncles with a bag of cellphones he stole from James Gong. He asks Daniel to fight alongside him and follow his lead closely.
Episode 227
Warren and Vasco begin wrestling and are surprised at how strong they are. Sally stops the fight when she thinks Warren is fighting an old man, and they plan to take the girls with them.

Gun.

Johan rushes towards Jin but is stopped by
Jerry Kwon

Notes
There are a lot of anti-smoking references in this arc (Daniel hitting Zack's cigarette, Johan and Olly putting out Jin's cigarettes with soup)
The
pedophile lawyer
in this arc was also seen trying to buy Mira's spit in the Jacedaichi Files arc and trying to get Jiho out of prison in the Daniel Park's Death arc.
