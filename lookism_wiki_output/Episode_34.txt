Summary
Zack
asked for a favor from
Namsoo
to look for a Limited Edition Jordans Shoes from the Craigslist. Having no idea on how much it costs, he only gave Namsoo $300. Namsoo had no choice but to find it despite the fact that it is almost impossible to get it with that price because he did not have the courage to tell Zack. Namsoo, who has almost given up, found a person who agreed to sell him the shoes for that price who, through the profile picture, appears to be a beautiful lady. The two agreed to meet the following day at Gian Station.
The next day at school, Namsoo informed Zack that he had found the shoes. Namsoo insisted on taking the shoes himself although Zack wanted to take it himself, saying that he is experienced enough to spot the product's authenticity (although this is actually because he wanted to meet the girl).
Right after Namsoo met the girl, he was startled with the presence of another two men who threatened to beat him up if he failed to pretend that they all are friends. He then realized that the girl was part of the scamming scene because she looked calm despite the situation. They all went to a quite, dead end, alley, and met the girl's boyfriend who presumably is the leader of the gang.
Haeri
(the girl) revealed that Namsoo had been chatting with her boyfriend Woojin, a thief from Gian High.
Woojin
took all the money and almost left when Namsoo suddenly stopped him and begged for mercy, stating that it is not his money, but his friend's who is a boxer. Feeling insulted by thinking it was a threat, Woojin beat Namsoo up.
