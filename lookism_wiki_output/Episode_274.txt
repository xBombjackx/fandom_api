Summary
Zack realizes they are in a trap and tries to take Daniel home, but he knocks him out the way. Daniel begins fighting Jerry. Jerry made a promise to himself the day Jake was disqualified that he would never lose another battle, but he loses easily to Daniel. When Daniel recovers from unconsciousness, Jerry decides to fight them with boxing.
Eli and Warren come across some Hostel members who have been stealing like Olly used to. Eli feels bad about it, and Warren tries to comfort him when Darius approaches them (he was released from prison before Jiho or Jake). He attacks Eli, and he defeats him easily with aikido. Then he is stabbed by little Eli, who Olly sent to fight him.
