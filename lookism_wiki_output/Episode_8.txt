Summary
Daniel
realizes how weak he is in his original body and tries exercising in the store. While doing that, a
pretty girl
sees him and he is initially embarrassed, but she compliments his determination and offers him a drink, surprising him.
Later,
Doo
and his men return to the store and call
Jiho
to steal a charger. Jiho gets out from bed and runs over, but fails to do so. However, he is grateful when Daniel is kind to him. Doo recognizes Daniel and proposes a loser battle between him and Jiho. Elsewhere,
Vasco
is listening to music and overhears the conversation.
Notes
The girl from the convenience store was later confirmed to be Crystal Choi.
