— Kitae Kim to Jinrang,
Episode 547
Kitae Kim (
김기태 Kim Gi-Tae
)
is a myth given muscle and motion, a fighter whose combat prowess is considered to be rivaled only by
James Lee
, the legend of the
First Generation
. Son of the famed
“Legendary Fist”
Gapryong Kim
, he anointed himself King of Seoul back when the First Generation bled ambition down every street. It was he who broke
Kwak Jichang’s
spine of influence, forcing the notorious
White Viper
into exile in the fields of Chungcheong Province before retreating to Mexico to oversee his drug empire.
He reappeared on South Korea’s soil as the smoke cleared from the chaos following the
Hunt for Gun
, leveraging his strong ties with
Taejin Cheon
to form a powerful alliance with
Goo Kim’s crew
.
History
Kitae Kim – his name drifts through the strata of
Lookism’s
hidden history like a blade cutting clean through silence. A ghost of the First Generation, Kitae is less remembered as a man and more as the residue of unrelenting violence: an echo of carnage that persists long after the deeds are done. Officially catalogued among the First Generation fighters, his history is defined more by speculation than by fact.
What little is known suggests a life rooted in bloodshed. Born an illegitimate son of Gapryong Kim, Kitae was introduced into a world that excluded him by default. Denied legitimacy, whether out of shame, scandal, or sheer neglect, his early years are a stain largely scrubbed from the Kim family’s history. At some point, under circumstances lost to rumor, he vanished from Korea and resurfaced in Tijuana, Mexico, where he immersed himself in the brutal heart of a violent cartel and forged his identity in blood.
The official details surrounding his father’s death remain ambiguous. Yet Kitae’s involvement was implied, hinting it was not peripheral but decisive. Some accounts suggest he masterminded the entire affair, driven to obliterate any legacy that might overshadow his own ascent. According to fragments of surviving rumor, he conspired with James Lee and Charles Choi to eliminate Gapryong Kim and his most loyal ally,
Baekho Kwon
, in a single coordinated blow. This double execution dismantled the last organized resistance of the older generation, clearing the path for Choi’s corporate empire and Kitae’s reign of sheer physical dominance.
Appearance
Kitae is a very tall and muscular man with sunken black eyes and slicked black hair with a single loose bang, His outfit consists in a black eather jacket that cover its shirtless abdomen, a black belt that has a silver fivel with blue jean pants and dark brown boots . He is stated to look eerily similar to Jake, possessing longer lashes through silhouettes. When his appearance was finally revealed, his hairstyle was notably similar to the one seen worn by Daniel Park's second body in the dream. He also carries with him a hatchet wherever he goes.
When he arrived in Korea, he wears a red polo shirt with white stripes, dark gray pants kept with silver chains that holds a brown smoking pipe with a silver lighter and black pants These items are told to be items descended from Gapryong Kim himself to his children- who Kitae killed.
Personality
Minseon Kang’s terse verdict—describing Kitae as
“the evil side”
of Gapryong Kim—offers perhaps as the most accurate lens through which to understand him. He is not simply a violent man; he is the concentrated core of his father’s ferocity, stripped of any pretense of conscience, loyalty, or restraint. Where Gapryong Kim’s strength carried a semblance of purpose, Kitae embodies the same force liberated from any ethical boundary.
A closer examination of his behavior reveals not just a killer, but a psychopath so utterly habituated to his own depravity that atrocity becomes mundane. For Kitae, violence is not a reaction to conflict but a fundamental expression of existence. He does not kill because he must, but because his inner world places no inherent value on human life. His willingness to butcher anyone with a hatchet speaks volumes: he favors violence in its rawest, most personal incarnation—face to face, immersed in the victim’s final moments.
One of the clearest glimpses into his psyche comes from a single act: his casual walk through the streets of Seoul, his clothes soaked in fresh blood. This scene exposes a man utterly indifferent to social order and consequence. The fear of authority, the sting of guilt, the shame that might haunt lesser criminals—none of these apply to him. His only reflection on the aftermath is tellingly neutral: he notes, almost analytically, that Korean police operate “quickly,” contrasting it with his experiences in Mexico. To him, a murder scene is not a moral reckoning but a logistical detail to be catalogued for future reference.
Relationships
0th Generation
Gapryong Kim
Analyzing Kitae Kim’s connection to his father, Gapryong Kim, demands an admission that their “relationship” never fit any sane definition of “father and son.”
From the moment Kitae clawed his way into the world, he was branded filth in flesh—a bastard spawned from the moment of a great man’s weakness, an aberration that mocked the legacy of the “Fist” more than it upheld it. In a society where bloodline sanctifies identity, Kitae was not heir, but a shameless wound left to rot in plain sight—a living proof that even someone like the almighty “Fist” could rot from within.
His resentment then, is not some petty grudge born of paternal neglect. It is the logical byproduct of a world that exiles the illegitimate as if they carry disease. The damage calcified into purpose. In Tijuana, where the Kim name meant nothing, he underwent a violent rebirth. What emerged was not a runaway son, but a man who became his own god, enthroned atop an empire of blood and terror.
Patricide was the crowning honor of this self-made myth. Though the public record brands James Lee the killer,
Jinyoung Park’s
delirious confession—that Kitae himself ended the Fist’s life—strips the lie bare. He did not simply murder a father; he obliterated a monument. His father’s final breath was a boy’s last, desperate plea to be
seen
.
And yet the corpse did not silence the hunger. If anything, death only metastasized it. Kitae’s obsession bloomed into ritual: hunting half-brothers scattered like filth across Gapryong’s secret life, tearing them apart not merely to kill, but to hoard every scrap of fatherly affection they clung to that he was denied of. By murdering them and tearing their keepsakes from their corpses, he desecrates them and feeds on their ghosts, stealing the father he could not inherit in life in an attempt to feel whole again.
Thus, to call Kitae’s connection to Gapryong merely “bad” is a coward’s understatement. What binds him is not just resentment, but an obsessive, cannibalistic need for him. His empire is a mausoleum built atop Gapryong’s bones. Every corpse Kitae leaves rotting beneath foreign sun is an offering to him—a hope that somewhere beneath the blood and ruin, his father will look back through dead eyes and know him at last.
1st Generation
James Lee
At some point in the past, before the developments of Cheonliang, James Lee killed Gapryong Kim, with Kitae being implied to have helped him. He would then go to Mexico for an extended period, returning to South Korea to dethrone Jichang Kwak upon James' request, before returning to the Americas.
Though the two are suggested to have once worked under Charles Choi along with
Gun Park
and
Goo Kim
to create the Four Major Crews, how their relationship developed afterward is still unclear. James Lee and Gitae Kim appear to be on friendly terms, as seen in the Cheonliang Flashback.
Synopsis
History
Not much is known about his past, what is known is that he was involved in the death of
Gapryong Kim
, and that
James Lee
sent him to defeat
Jichang Kwak
, and steal his throne as the King of Seoul, succeeding in both.
Fighting Prowess
Daniel Park copying Kitae's brutal strikes in Ultra Instinct
His combat power is said by
Gongseob Ji
to be "the peak of the 1st Generation", therefore, he was one of the few kings who along with Jichang Kwak (albeit for different reasons, Jichang spared out of pity), had nothing taken away by
James Lee
. (However, this could also be attributed to the two being on the same side during the 1st generation.).
Furthermore, his fighting style does not seem to possess a specific "technique," instead embodying raw strength and speed. He is described to have the speed of Gongseob Ji and the power of Taesoo Ma in his fists by Jichang Kwak during their fight while heavily holding back. Kitae also possesses enough power to mirror Jichang's hand blade, though rather than chopping with the side of his hand, he stabbed the side of Jichang's hand itself by only using his fingers, digging underneath the skin up to Kitae's second knuckle.
Later in the Busan arc, Gitae has demonstrated
Mastery
in Resistance
, coming out practically unharmed from all the attacks he has suffered to date. The only one who has injured him was Jinrang when he surpassed his limits after witnessing the death of his brothers, reaching a new level of
Conviction
, and even then the damage was superficial. Even when several police officers used tasers on him and discharged a shock throughout his body, he remained unperturbed until calmly answering a cell phone.
It has been noted that Kitae tries to imitate others, though rather than being the true copying talent, as held by Jinyoung Park and Johan Seong, Kitae's imitation is just a cheap facsimile, instead supplementing his lack of talent with pure brute force, shown when he tried to imitate Jichang Kwak's handblade.
