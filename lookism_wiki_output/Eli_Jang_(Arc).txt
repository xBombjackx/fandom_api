Synopsis
Episode 232
The story begins with
Sally Park
, a middle schooler in Gangdong. Sally has a good life on the outside; she is pretty, has a lot of friends and her family owns a large building. She has a lot of boys wanting to date her, one of them being
Warren Chae
, an orphan from another middle school. She even tells Warren that she feels sorry for him, which makes him confused. In reality, Sally is an orphan who lives alone in an empty building. She feels sorry for Warren because she knows what it is like to be an orphan, and she longs for a family.
One night she finds
a cat
let itself into her house. She follows the cat to find a homeless boy snuck into her house. She is intrigued and asks what he is doing there, and he responds by calling her a bitch. The boy is
Eli Jang
in the past.
Episode 233
Sally decides to allow Eli to stay in the spur of the moment. He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then "he will get in big trouble".
At school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.
Warren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park. He doesn't like how close she is to Eli and tries to intimidate him. Eli bites his nose and swears at him, and Sally realizes he is scared of Warren. Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.
Episode 234
Sally tells Eli not to fight and Warren punches Eli. Sally then gets angry at Warren and tells him he is mean for hitting Eli. Warren walks away feeling hurt, but returns in the night claiming he will stay at Sally's so he can protect her. Sally protests but eventually allows him and his friends
Max and Derrick
to stay.
In a bathroom, Backdoor's leader
Darius Hong
is using the toilet when he hears that Warren Chae beat multiple members of Backdoor on his own. He decides to retaliate and asks if Warren is pretty.
In Sally's house, Max and Derrick explain their backstory to Sally. Max was abandoned in a clothing bin and Derrick was abandoned on a bus. Warren explains that he, Max and Derrick live in the same orphanage and that is how they met. Sally explains her backstory, that her parents died in an accident and left her the building. They ask Eli to explain his backstory, and he tells them that he killed his dad.
Episode 235
He claimed when he was younger, he used to have parents, but his father got drunk and would hit his wife. When Eli's mother ran away his father married a new woman who was physically and emotionally abusive towards him. When Eli's father died his wife married a new man who was just as abusive. Eli grew sick of his treatment and ran away from home with Lyon, saying that it was more comfortable on the streets.
Everyone is shocked to hear his story, and Warren asks if Eli has any good memories. Eli mentions a hide and seek game he used to play with his biological mother, and Sally suggests that they play. Eli doesn't want to play but the others race to find hiding spots. Warren opts out of the game, and Eli begins to count.
Max and Derrick are the first to be found. Lyon scratches Max and he yells, causing Eli to find him. Eli then suddenly attacks Max, and when Derrick comes to the rescue he beats up Derrick as well. Sally moves around during the game and finds Max and Derrick on the ground. She freezes and Eli finds her. Right as he is about to punch her he is stopped by Warren, who asks what he is doing. Eli explains that he is it, and Sally realizes that Eli was abused by his first mother as well.
Warren asks Eli why he didn't hit him back, and Eli says he doesn't fight unless he gets something from it. Warren offers Eli anything he wants if Eli wins to fight, and if he loses Eli has to leave Sally's place. Eli stands to fight him.
Episode 236
Warren and Eli start fighting, and Warren notices that Eli fights very dirty, poking him in the eyes and kicking him in his manhood. When Warren is knocked to the ground Eli grabs a sign to smash his head in, and Warren sees that Eli has the eyes of a killer. Max and Derrick manage to hold Eli back, and Sally tells all of them to get out. They stop fighting because none of them want to freeze in the cold.
Sally asks Eli why he is fighting over her and he says he wanted to try on Warren's uniform. He explains that he only liked the hide and seek game because that was when his mother payed any attention to him. Warren gives Eli his jacket and calls the fight between them a draw.
At Sally's cram school she finds herself surrounded by Backdoor members. Her friend Olly Wang tries to diffuse the situation but is beaten. Eli shows up looking for Sally, and the Backdoor members mistake him for Warren Chae. He beats them all and Sally thanks him and introduces him to her friends
Heather
and
Olly
, later stating that if Eli hadn't met them their story may have been less tragic.

Sally begins spending her food on her new roommates, causing her to miss school. Olly and Heather visit often, Olly because he admires Eli and Heather because she has a crush on Eli. Warren worries that Sally is running out of money, and to quell his fears Eli hands Sally a large stack of cash. Warren is shocked and asks where Eli got the money, but he won't tell them.
Olly follows Eli and asks him to show how he earns money. Eli shows him how to break into cars and steal money, and Olly is amazed by Eli's street smarts. He tells the crew he knows how to make money, and suggests they rob houses instead of cars. He even has a specific house whose patterns he studied. Warren is against it but Eli agrees with Olly, and they all go to rob a house.
When they enter the house Warren begins having second thoughts and is consumed with guilt. As he is about the leave Olly shows him the jewelry he found that they can sell. Eli compliments him but they are interrupted when the parents return. The father brings a stick and prepares to beat them but Olly intervenes and takes the hits so they can run. The father stops in shock as he realizes he hit his own son, because the house Olly decided to rob was his own.
Episode 238
Warren beats Olly for hitting his parents, and is disgusted by his behavior. Olly asks why Warren cannot empathize with him, because he only robbed his house to help them. He explains that he feels trapped at home and wishes he had the freedom they had, even saying he wishes he was an orphan. Eli tells Olly that he understands him, but he needs to return home.
Olly is desperate to earn Eli's approval back. He begins robbing minors using Heather's photograph. He shows the money to Eli, but Eli is upset. He asks why Olly wants to be like him, when he has lived such a sad life. Olly disagrees with Eli, saying that his hardships are worth becoming as cool as Eli is. They are interrupted by Darius Hong, who mistakes Eli for Warren and gets too close to his face. Eli punches Darius and is horrified to see not only did it do no damage, Darius seemed to enjoy it.
At the building Warren, Heather and Sally are surrounded by members of Backdoor. Warren tells the girls to close there eyes as he prepares to fight.

Back at the building Warren has beaten all the Backdoor members, and lays on the ground bloodied. He tells Sally not to worry, and Max and Derrick grumble that he cannot do anything without them.
The girls clean the boys' wounds and Warren complains that Sally sounds like a mother when she nags them. He then suggests that they become a family, since they have nobody else to take care of them. He proposes he will be the brother, and Eli proposes to be the dad, with Max and Derrick as brothers and Sally as the mother. Eli chooses the name 'Hostel' for their family, an acronym of their first letters of their names. Olly is upset that he isn't a member of
