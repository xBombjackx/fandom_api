Summary
Samuel has a flashback to when he first learned about his father. He created Gangseo Union so he could become a gangster like Gapryong Kim. He would follow him to his campaigns and protect him from civilians who harassed him and were angry about his crimes. Samuel's hope was to become prominent enough to be able to approach Gapryong. When he came back from seeing Gapryong for the first time, his mother showed him his real father, an tradesman who abandoned his family a long time ago. The picture he cherished of Gapryong was taken by his real father during an outing with his mother. Gapryong also has a vasectomy, so he couldn't have children after Jake.
Samuel was so enraged he tried to choke his father. He made himself believe Gapryong was his father, because the alternative was too painful to bear. He never did get to meet Gapryong, and he is angry that Jake has the life he dreamed of. However, his emotions make Samuel unstable in the fight, and he ends up losing to Jake. Gun congratulates Jake on his victory. Sinu arrives at that moment to show Jake how to defeat Gun.
