Summary
Daniel
tries to act as though he doesn't care about
James Lee
but
Eugene
calls him out, saying he must be interested in the identity he was given. He says he will tell Daniel more about James Lee if he joins the
Workers
, since Daniel could be useful in defeating
Choi
. Daniel refuses, saying he has seen too much about the Workers to ever work with them.
Johan
regains his vision and kicks
Mandeok
, asking
Zack
why he decided to help. Zack says he doesn't remember the reason, and Johan decides to help him fight.
Hostel
have united with
God Dog
and J High, and
Big Deal
have united with the Workers. Eugene asks
Eli
where
Yenna
is at the moment, and Hostel's two nieces. He also mentions
Johan's mother
, the
Burn Knuckles
and Daniel's friends
Zoe
,
Mira
and
Joy
. Daniel tells the others to not fall for Eugene's bluff, but they are all scared. Eugene says he is willing to not harm the hostages if they hand over Johan. Daniel refuses and says that he will go in Johan's stead. After the meeting, everyone rushes home to find everyone is safe.
Warren
is angry that Eugene was bluffing all along.
Samuel asks Eugene why he didn't just fight them there, and Eugene says he thought of something fun. He asks why
Samuel
was talking to Eli, and Samuel says Eugene should trust him. Eugene then reveals that he was not bluffing about hostages, that his men were just on standby and not in action. Daniel is given a gold badge and an office, along with a kitsune mask. He reveals that he did not join the Workers to help them, but to destroy them from the inside.
