Fighting Prowess
Hashik Song's combat strength was compared to that of the 1st Generation Kings by
Diego Kang
who stated that he was more dangerous than the leaders of Busan's Four Major Crews. His kicks were strong enough to hurt and injure
Zack Lee
whose body was as hard as iron and moved so fast that Zack could barely keep up with the speed of his attacks.
