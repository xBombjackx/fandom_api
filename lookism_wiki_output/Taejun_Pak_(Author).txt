I like to draw ever since I was a child. When I was 6-7 years old, I liked to copy the comics that my mother gave me. I've taken comic majors but I’ve quit since I couldn't afford it at that time. Subsequently then. I tried many jobs; from doing business online, modeling and staring in variety shows. But my interest in illustrating. rebound when I found Line Webtoon. This digital platform facilitates anyone to take part in and it has a wider medium to draw. Thus, I decided to create this Comic from my Past experiences in school.
