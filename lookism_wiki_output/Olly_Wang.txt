Olly Wang (왕오춘 Wang O-Chun)
was a supporting character and antagonist in
Lookism
. He was the head of Hostel A.
Appearance
Olly was a extremely tall and muscular young man with sunken black eyes, black dreadlocks kept with a salmon pink headband, a white shirt under a dark brown coat with beige fur, black pants and black shoes. He had a tattoo of a compass under his right eye, he also have tattoos on his abdomen, which consists in a Eastern Dragon accompained by a flower.
In his school days, he has short and neat hair, a grayish-blue shirt with a navy blue tie and a brown backpack.
Personality
Olly was a reckless young man with a obsession for dangerous activities. His first appearance was leaping off a smash building and landing on
James'
car. Despite his craziness, Olly was a very intelligent character and impressed
Gun Park
with his business skills the first time they met.
Jin Jang
also decided to work with Olly because he was one of the smartest heads of the crews.

This was further supported by the fact that Olly not only saw through Jin Jang's plans and predicted Jang's betrayal but allowed it to happen in order to get Jin Jang to create a distraction, allowing Olly to have alone time with
Eli Jang
.

In the flashback chapters, Olly was introduced as a shy but ambitious person. Upon knowing more about Eli, he praised him and wanted to be like him, going to extreme lengths to get his attention. Many fans compare him to
Jiho Park
, as both characters sought acknowledgement and validation from their peers, but got the wrong idea of being superior. However, while Jiho was often spiteful of
Daniel
's friendship and used Daniel and
Zack
as a means to a higher status, Olly desperately wanted to be a part of Eli's friend group but was repeatedly rejected by Eli because he was not an orphan like the rest of them.
In the end, Olly desperately wanted to be accepted by Eli Jang and Hostel, because he considered them family. In
Episode 239
, he remarked that the “O” in Hostel should represent Olly himself not
Warren
. It is later revealed, despite everything, he always considered Hostel his family above anything else and worked in his own way to protect them, such as covering Hostel B's payments to Gun and making Gun promise not to hurt Eli.
His reckless behavior and choices can be attributed to the fact that he cannot feel pain or emotions. This inability to feel anything also contributed to his obsession with Eli Jang because he believes that Eli was the only one who has made him feel anything previously (this is later revealed to be false, and his guilt over his involvement in
Heather's
death is really what caused the feelings). He often made exaggerated facial expressions because he was forced to act in order to mimic emotions. Due to this, he had to practice his facial expressions.
Fighting Prowess
Not much is known about Olly's current fighting skills. He used to be weak when he was friends with Eli Jang, however he later underwent training by Gun, as head of one the four crews.
While we don't know the components of his training, we do know that Olly felt no pain and fear towards anyone. This gave him almost supernatural endurance and durability, to the point where he could even tank hits from Warren Chae, Eli Jang, and Gun with no issue. The training had also given him Aikido as one of his martial arts.
It was hinted by several characters that Olly may be one of the strongest fighters in the entire series. Jin Jang had noted that Olly Wang rarely fought others on his own, relying on the Uncles instead. He also did not put much work into his crew, instead using Hostel as a means to find Eli. Jin Jang even went so far as to say if Olly had made any serious moves he would have been the one to "dissolve the four crews into one".

Additionally,
Goo Kim
and Gun have noted in one of their conversations that it was ridiculous for Olly to seek out Eli if he wanted to feel fear because Olly was stronger than Eli.

Quotes
Trivia
Olly Wang was one of the few Chinese characters in Lookism, alongside
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
.
Olly Wang had some form of congenital analgesia allowing him to feel no pain which allowed him to grow very strong in a short amount of time under Gun's training.
Gun offered him training in a fighting style that was perfectly suited to his body and skills but he turned him down in order to become a copy of Eli and his fighting skills.

Jin Jang had speculated that if Olly Wang had put in as much effort into Hostel A as the other Crew Heads did, he would have been the one to unite all four crews under his control.

Olly Wang didn't fear Eli, just felt guilt for the reason of killing
Heather
.
