Summary
Ever since Taesoo lost to DG, he has been training his left fist for revenge. Even though he abandoned his principle, it didn't matter if he could kill DG. Now his fist reaches DG. Hudson is shocked to see James Lee threatened by Taesoo and dodging his powerful punches. DG however tells Taesoo that he's gotten weaker, and he kicks him to the ground. Taesoo recalls DG telling him after their first fight that the reason he was so powerful was the faith he had in himself. By giving up on his values, Taesoo is weaker in DG's perspective.
Hudson sees his idol crumbling before him and starts crying. DG tells Taesoo not to bother him, and he says that it doesn't matter. The first generation know that James Lee exists, and they will come after him for their own reasons. DG says it wouldn't be a problem since the second generation isn't made of pushovers.
Daniel confronts Jiho at the convenience store and asks him if he still pretends to smoke. Jiho asks how Daniel knew the location, and he says this was the first place the two of them fought. He then tells Daniel that he asked him to come like this because he has two bodies.
