Summary
Jake believes Daniel must know something about
Sinu Han
since he is a VVIP. He tries to send a signal by sneezing, and Daniel doesn't understand but tries to send his own signals asking about drugs and secrets of the third affiliate.
Vivi's friends Antonio, Michael and Jonathan ask her why she is working in the club, and she tells them about how difficult it is to sell and use drugs in China compared to Korea. They ask her about her other drug business, Pungsan. Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
Jake and Daniel are finding it difficult to tease information out of each other. Jake gives up and asks Daniel to ask the president about Sinu Han if he sees them, because Sinu is his long lost brother. Daniel says he will, and they go to ask Xiaolong to see the president since he is a VVIP. Vivi and her friends are high in a room lined with mushrooms, so Xiaolong denies them. Daniel says he'll report this to the Workers and Xiaolong grabs him by the neck, saying he doesn't care if Daniel is a VVIP or not, he can always go back to China. Daniel escapes the choke and asks Xiaolong if there are drugs inside that room.
