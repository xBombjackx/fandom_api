Summary
Eli tries fighting Gun but he is overpowered easily.
Gun
explains to
Eli
that
Olly Wang
has been paying for their protection for years. He has decided to stop demanding money from
Hostel
as a last favor for Olly, because he has
Big Deal
and
Workers
to rely on. Eli relays all of this information to the gang at J High and tells them they should be careful dealing with Gun, because he doesn't want there to be any more tragedies.
Zack
remembers this as he visits
Johan's mother
, and swears he will bring him back home.
Jasmine's
father also grieves Jasmine's loss, hugging her blanket in a strange manner.
Meanwhile
Daniel
mulls over the tragedy of Hostel. He decides to investigate the secret of
