Summary
Samuel has a flashback to when he asked the Black Bear gang to help him. He used the stores as collateral to ask for a loan of the Black Bear gang: they would pay the stores, and in return the gang would help them defeat Goo and Gun. However, he bet that Gun and Goo would defeat them, and in return he would not have to pay a cent. Gun is impressed by his foresight and wants to congratulate him, but Samuel gives Old Face the credit of the plan. Jake is disgusted by Samuel and decides to leave, reminded of his own father. The Black Bear gang eventually goes out of business.
Goo heads to a house in a neighborhood, where he finds Charles Choi sitting on the ground with a few others. He greets the workers head, who has just managed to make a name for his gang. There is also another person in the room: James Lee, one of the ten geniuses.
