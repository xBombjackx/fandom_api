Workers (4 Affiliates)
The two girls featured in the last chapter whisper to each other. One mentions how attractive Samuel is, but the other says that Daniel was still more attractive. Samuel ignores their whispering, even going so far to tell them not to interrupt him. He agrees to hire them because he thinks that they had a 'baby sister' vibe and introduces them to the top five streamers on Kwitch, then leaves to do something else.

Samuel grabs Daniel by the arm and confirms it with a smirk. He tells Daniel about the history of Workers, saying it was established to make a hundred billion dollars. He then asks with a fake smile if there was anything that Daniel was concerned about regarding it, and Daniel says no. Samuel leaves, looking miffed.

Daniel submits an application to the executive, Samuel, who tells Daniel that he wants him in the company because of the potential for success. He states that Daniel had an incredibly high number of streamers for his first streamcast, earned the nickname 'King Daniel' already, and was relatable to the viewers.

Samuel stares out the full length window from the top floor and reminds one of the employees to not touch any of the streamer's belongings, because it might leave a trail.
In the morning, he checks up on Daniel. He says that Daniel had been causing a disruption by ordering so much fried chicken, and tells Daniel that he would not be able to escape by asking the deliveryman even if he wanted to, because the food always went through people working for Workers before it went to the streamers. He then asks Daniel if he went into Samuel's personal room (Daniel did), and Daniel attempts to punch him instead of answering, but is stopped by Senior Manager Kim, the leader of the Fourth Affiliate's security team. Samuel states that he always hires people to do his work instead of doing it himself, so he would not fistfight Daniel. Samuel then turns around and leaves, telling security to teach Daniel a lesson.
Upstairs, Samuel reports to Alexander, telling him that their revenue would succeed the Third Affiliate's that month, and reports on the newest streamers. Alexander tells him that he would make a good president. He then asks about how someone came to visit the company from the four major crews.
Samuel says that it was Hostel, and mentions that he saw Eli Jang at the front of the building earlier. He laughs when he mentions Olly Wang's death to Alexander. Samuel also says he saw Daniel, and Alexander says that Gun had approved of him.
Alexander angrily beats Samuel because it was not reported to him earlier. He tells Samuel that he did not want to get involved in the Four Major Crews if it was not necessary.Alexander says that Samuel was still not like his old self.
When he leaves the room, Samuel reflects to the time he met Gun after he managed to beat up a large group of people. Lost in thought, he bumped shoulders with a man. The man handed him the box of fried chicken after exchanging brief words, then takes off his motorcycle helmet to reveal Daniel Park.
Samuel comments that he did not usually deal with intruders, but cracks his neck in preparation.
