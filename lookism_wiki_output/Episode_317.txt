Summary
Jake's friends begin asking about the numbers racket, and Jake refuses to tell him. He is losing money quickly, and the head of the scam slaps him and asks if he wants them to fail. He tells Jake that making money isn't easy, and he has to sacrifice something to get what he wants. Jake remembers Gun's offer to earn money by becoming his successor, and swallows his pride, deciding to continue the gambling scheme. Even though he sees the pain of the people getting scammed, he decides it is worth it if he can rescue Sinu and save Big Deal.
When Vasco came to demand Jiho's money, Jake was reminded of himself. However, even his attempts to earn money were shut down when Gun disqualified himself. Jake recalls all of this as he wakes up in present time. He commanded Lineman to bring every member of Big Deal so they can attack the Workers, and force Gun to show himself to them.
