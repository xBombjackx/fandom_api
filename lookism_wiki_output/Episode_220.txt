Summary
Some vloggers are making a video on runaway fams when they are attacked by
James Gong
, now a member of Moley's runaway fam. Moley worries that James will steal his authority so he shows him how to steal dolls from a vending machine. James rams his car into the machine to steal the entire thing, and Moley is shocked. The girls in the runaway fam reveal that they picked up a new member, who is Jasmine Huh.
Daniel meets two girls he calls 'Hilarious' and 'Like What', because that is all they say. He asks the girls to take him to Hostel but they don't know what that is. He takes them out to eat and feels bad when he sees
how hungry they are. He asks them how they earn their money and they refuse to tell him, because he is too innocent. He asks them to take him to their runaway fam, and they agree.
When Daniel gets to the house he is shocked to see how many people live there. The leader is Riley Oh, who greets him by throwing a bottle at his head. Riley tries to hit one of the girls for bringing Daniel but he grabs his arm. Riley orders his people to lock the door.
