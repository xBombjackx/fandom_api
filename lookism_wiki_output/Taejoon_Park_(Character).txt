Taejoon Park (박태준
Pak Tae Joon
)
is a minor character and an Architecture student at
J High.
Appearance
Taejoon is a short male student with pale skin and black hair. He is found to be rather unattractive by many others, being the reason of why he is often treated harshly and disrespectfully. His facial features consist of relatively thick eyebrows, dark-coloured eyes which tilt upwards, various layers of fat in his chin and pimples and warts on his cheeks. Taejoon also intentionally styled his hair like
Vasco
before shaving it afterwards.
Personality
Taejoon is obsessed with becoming famous and would usually go to extreme measures to gain the attention from others. He looks at famous 'Pacebook' stars and well-known broadcasters with respect and admiration as he dreams of 'rubbing shoulders with them'. Afterwards, it is found that Taejoon only wants attention because he wants to feel like people actually think that he is worth something and he only wishes to be an attention-seeker because he wants favorable attention, not the unwanted attention he receives from bullies and gossipers. He is notorious for his lying, and often called "Taejoon Park, the Liar".
After comparing Taejoon's attitude to when he was striving for attention to when he had Vasco come over to his house,
Jace
realised that Taejoon looked more genuinely happy when Vasco came over because he actually had a friend who believed him about his small dog.
