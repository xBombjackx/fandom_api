Background
Gun Park grew up in the family of the very famous and powerful leader of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
,
Shingen Yamazaki
, a legend comparable to
Gapryong Kim
in Japan, in the Yamazaki family of the Yakuza mafia organization. Gun Park was one of the four children conceived by Shingen Yamazaki, the current leader of the Yamazaki syndicate after the defeat of the
Gapryong Kim's Fist Gang
, with the goal of becoming Yamazaki's hope and taking their clan to the next level. Gun Park was originally born with reversible eyes (
Ultra Instinct
) from a
Somi Park
, woman and from the Hangure clan. From an early age, under the mentorship of
Shigeaki Kojima
and
Hiroaki Kojima
, Gun established himself as a genius who learns with great speed, and from an early age it became known that in a month he is able to master any martial art. However, for all his merits, he did not receive a name from his father, and he was also the leader of the clan. On the instructions of his mother, in order to earn a name from his father, Gun, as an elementary school student, he forcibly captured most gangs in Japan in one day. However, Gun had a cousin
Haruto Yamazaki
, the son of
Shintaro Yamazaki
, who treated him with love for his brother, and instructed him on a kind and honest path, without bloodshed, and most importantly advised him to live without relying on the expectations of others, and follow his own path. Gun Park told everything to Shintaro Yamazaki, the vice-head of the Yamazaki clan, and in order to follow all the rules of his clan, he forced Gun to kill his brother, and a little later he forced Haruto to commit Harakiri, which he did to please his father.
However, at the same time, the vassals of the Yamazaki syndicate intended to overthrow and kill Shingen and his son, Gun Park, and put his brother Shintaro Yamazaki in place of the head, acting not in the interests of the clan leader, but for the sake of the Yamazaki clan itself, but Shintaro flatly rejected this idea, saying that they had condemned themselves to death. After some time, the vassals nevertheless decided to attack Shingen himself, and the sons of the vassals attacked Gun Park, Shingen's son. However, the task turned out to be a failure on both sides, the vassals and their sons lost in an unequal battle with Shingen and Gun. After these events, Gun personally met his father and asked for his name, but Shingen did not even know about the existence of Gun all this time, showed his indifference, and then personally said that Gun was not his son, which hurt and hurt Gun very much.
Soon Gun Park arrived in Korea, in Seoul, and after a while he ended up in a juvenile colony for unknown reasons. In the juvenile colony, Gun Park came up with an individual training plan for himself to become stronger, the training consisted in the fact that all the prisoners of the prison fought against him alone. Soon after such training, Gun Park left a huge bloodstain on the wall of the Prison. Also at the time of his stay in prison, Gun Park met
Charles Choi
, who was working as a janitor at that time. And a year later, Charles Choi opened his own business and began to educate Gun Park as a Genius of Nurture, and also began to study with
Tom Lee
.
At some point in the past, after leaving the juvenile prison, the HNH chairman sent Gun to test
Goo Kim
's fighting ability in order to recruit him as Gun's partner. Both fighters were infamous for their prowess, and both individuals seemed to have heard of the other before their first encounter. Though it was not explicitly shown, it can be inferred that their first fight was intense and resulted in
Goo
giving Gun the scar between his eyes (and possibly more on his back and torso), while Gun caused
Goo
to need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments. The outcome, however, was unclear, as both fighters suffered heavy injuries. After the fight they joined forces and created the
4 crews
.
Gun was eventually assigned to bodyguard
Crystal Choi
, leaving
Goo Kim
to handle the business on his own much to his annoyance. They are seen meeting up together and talking about the crew heads or fighters throughout the series on different occasions.
