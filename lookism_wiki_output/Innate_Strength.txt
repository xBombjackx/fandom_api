Innate Strength
is a rare and inherited talent through the blood of children of Legends, allowing them to experience a newfound level of strength after Awakening it. This has only been seen in
Vin Jin
and
Jake Kim
so far. Their eyes will glow purple and their strength grows exponentially.

Achieving Innate Strength
As Gapryong Kim once said
[

]
everyone is capable of having superhuman power, and that he was only strong because he had managed to find the way to this strength. Even so, it is not easy to achieve this strength, however, the children of those who possessed the Innate Strength seem to unconsciously have an easier time finding this path, such as Jake Kim and Vin Jin.
Users
Gapryong Kim's Lineage
Gapryong Kim

His eldest son,
Kitae Kim
, uses this strength in an extremely unrefined way, without applying any technique, in addition Kitae uses this strength to supplement his lack of talent for the Copy Technique.
His second son,
Jake Kim
, has this still unawakened strength, using it from time to time, when faced with situations of extreme danger, the way he used his Innate Strength is similar to his father, and when he is able to use, he takes on a look very similar to Gapryong.
Mujin Jin's Lineage
Mujin Jin
has still been very little explored, but from what has been shown, he used his Innate Strength in his fighting style, to improve the strength of his grabs and throws.
His only son,
Vin Jin
, also has the Innate Strength, but it is still unawakened, as does Jake Kim. Vin uses this strength to mainly exponentially increase the strength of his grip.
