Summary
Jiho is upset that he is too weak to do anything for himself. He tries to workout and gets tired easily and remembers how strong his friends are. Just as he is about to give up he spies the pocket knife on the floor next to him and decides he can do something after all. He leaves his house and his mother complains that a friend is waiting for him. Daniel (the friend) is concerned about Jiho.
Jiho visits James at the pool place and slices him with the knife, asking if James thinks he is weak. When he trips on his own legs James replies that he does, and begins hitting Jiho with the pool stick. Daniel holds James back and tells Jiho to run while he can.
Jiho gets upset at Daniel and tells him to mind his business. When Daniel mentions that they are friends Jiho scoffs at him, asking how he can relate to Jiho. Daniel mentions that Jiho is friends with his other body and
Duke
, and they can relate to him. Jiho is triggered and pushes Daniel and James out the window.
