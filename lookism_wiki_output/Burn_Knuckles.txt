Burn Knuckles
is a gang located in Central Seoul. It is made of members of the Architecture Department in
J High.
Their leader is Vasco.
History
The Burn Knuckles was founded by
Vasco
during his first year in high school. The story goes that he would grab delinquents by the shoulder and warn them to stop smoking. The students were so impressed by Vasco's strength and character that they decided to transfer to J High's Architecture department and join the first generation of Burn Knuckles. Since then, underclassmen have also joined to form the second generation of Burn Knuckles.
The purpose of the Burn Knuckles is to protect. Vasco believes that power exists to protect the weak. The Burn Knuckles abide by that principle strictly, and are very loyal to Vasco. They will not fight unless he gives the order to. Their strength and loyalty has led some characters like
Daniel
to compare Burn Knuckles to the four crews, but
Jace
disagrees with this comparison, stating that the Burn Knuckles are only friends of Vasco and nothing more.
The Burn Knuckles' location in Central Seoul has led to the four crews being hesitant to establish main operations there. However, this has not stopped gangs like
Big Deal
and
God Dog
from attempting to take over Central Seoul. In the God Dog Arc, Vasco swore to help Daniel defeat the four crews alongside him. Since then, the Burn Knuckles have been antagonistic towards the four crews.
Organization
Vasco is the leader and the founder of the Burn Knuckles, and is their main source of strength. Aside from him, Burn Knuckles have seven executive members called the Seven Meisters. They are also known as the "Tool Council" because they all carry a tool of some kind; whether this is because of their status as Architecture students is unknown. The seven are listed below:
"Monkey Spanner"
Jace Park
(Burn Knuckles Strategist, & Second in Command)
"Seoul Tour Helper"
Woong
"The Nutcracker"
Ira Oh
"Crying Hammer"
Mason Hwang
"Flying Nipper"
Jimmy Wang
"Cute Duck"
Damon Goh
"Safety Helmet"
Seongryong Choi
The Burn Knuckles used to have black leather jackets as their uniform. Freshman Burn Knuckles wear blue jumpsuits. Sophomore Burn Knuckles used to wear grey, but now wear orange jumpsuits.
