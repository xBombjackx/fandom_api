Daniel is in the convenience store when he sees all his old friends. His second body comes in and walks away with them, and he is sad to be left behind. Then he sees his old body come to him and ask why he can't approach his friends first. He races to catch them and thanks his old self, but it has disappeared. He smiles and realizes he had to leave his old self behind before he could change into his better self. With this, he wakes up in his second body.

Back at the hospital Daniel's nurse is worried about him, but he tells her he will be alright. His original body is resting in a different bed. The nurse mentions a friend who lived in the hospital to take care of him, and Daniel spots
Jay
in the hallway. He was reading medical books to figure out how to help Daniel wake up. Daniel thanks Jay and he cries tears of joy.
