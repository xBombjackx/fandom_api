Synopsis
History
Xiaolung is of Chinese background coming to Korea in order to stay by Vivi's side. Xiaolung works for Vivi's father, a billionaire, and his only job is to protect Vivi. He has been protecting Vivi ever since she was a little girl.
Just like Gun, he recruits many different talents to join the executive crew to protect Vivi. One of them includes Taegon Wi, whom he recruited from the streets at a very young age. He also leads the Bicheon Gang which consists of 103 fire survivors from an incident.
Before meeting Vivi and her dad, as a child, he was among 108 unregistered people— no identity, nationality, or family. He was shown in bloodshed where he had killed his ‘brothers’ he'd grown up with and that ends with him earning his ‘right’. He was then introduced to Vivi— someone who [he] is going to protect forever, someone [he] has to give his life for.
After fighting Jake Kim in the Hunt for Big Deal and realizing the truth, Xiaolung returned to China just in time to stop Vivi's arranged marriage and ran away with her so they could finally be together.
Fighting Prowess
Protecting ViVi
Xiaolung is a proficient fighter, stated to be on par with Gun by
Old Face

His weapon of choice is a
Guandao
and blades in his hair. Despite that, Xiaolung's fighting style has no difference whether or not he is physically holding the Guandao, being able to replicate the movements with the Guandao with nothing in his hand, making it appear as though he is striking with an unclenched fist. This martial art style is highly secretive, entitled "
Cheon Hohuigong".
He is immensely strong, enduring, and overwhelming Jerry Kwon with little difficulty and only later matched by Jake Kim after he trained for months in prison to surpass Gun. However, Xiaolung exhibits great durability and grit, having fought even after having his elbow dislocated by Jake. In fact, Xiaolung decided to fight with his broken arm like a whip.
Quotes
Forgive me... I am merely a sword to protect you

Trivia
Xiaolung is fluent in 4 languages: Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English.
Xiaolung's weapon is stated to be a Scimitar in the official English release, however, this is most likely a translation error or poor choice of localisation as a Scimitar is a curved blade of Middle-Eastern origin.
