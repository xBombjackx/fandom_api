"
I don't care about becoming the strongest. I do not fight to win. There is only one reason to use my fist, it's because I'm a man.

—Taesoo Ma to Beolgu Lee  in
episode 494
Taesoo Ma
is the former King of Ansan, and one of the Kings of the 1st Generation.
Appearance
Taesoo Ma is a muscular, tall, hulking man. He has black, messy, medium-length hair that is held back by a black headband. He has a rugged face paired with facial hair, he has a missing right eye and a scar in that area. His missing eye is a result of his fight with James Lee years ago and is now replaced with a removable fake eye.
Personality
Taesoo Ma was a man with a strong belief, believing that using his right hand was manly and admirable. This belief slowly faded away after his fight with James Lee. He then started to train and use his left hand in hopes of beating James Lee/DG, discarding the belief of using his right hand.
Despite his appearance, he can be quite caring as shown with his interactions and relationship with Hudson Ahn. He also prides himself as a member of the 1st Generation, boastfully stating that the 2nd Generation was not comparable to the 1st Generation.
He likes to be out in the wilderness so much that he
bought an entire mountain
just to hunt on it.
Relationships
Ansan Public
Taesoo Ma seems to have a teacher-alumni relationship with the leader of the
Ansan Public
,
Hudson Ahn
. Taesoo Ma had seemed to be pestered by Hudson to teach him how to become as strong as him as Taesoo was considered the "King of Ansan" when Hudson was younger. Hudson seems to have met him around the age of 16, Hudson learned from Taesoo that he uses his right arm in fighting and only uses the left when needed. It seems Taesoo left Ansan in Hudson's care and Hudson thinks very highly of his "Master" Taesoo Ma.
1st Generation
Na Chaegyeon
Taesoo and Chaegyeon have been shown to have an extremely bitter relationship, with Chaegyeon attempting to hit Taesoo with his car upon seeing him.
Fighting Prowess
Taesoo's unorthodox fighting style comes from his philosophy, to be a "man". He fought with only his right fist, which is so strong that James Lee and Daniel Park were unable to parry, and gave Daniel the fear of his arms breaking off. It was also able to cause Beolgoo Lee  to bald. After his defeat by the hands of James Lee, Taesoo trained his whole body, including his left hand, abandoning his principles, this caused him to deteriorate and be humiliated yet again at the feet of James Lee in the One Night arc.
After Taesoo realised he had betrayed his principles and lead as a bad example to Hudson, he got his act back together and retrained himself, developing the Ultimate Fist.
Ultimate Fist
After training his whole body, Taesoo uses every single muscle in his body to use one strike, one that encompasses both Strength and Speed Mastery, to deal devastating damage to his opponent. This is his trump card only to be used against the strongest of opponents, such as James Lee.

Taesoo Ma is only smoker that smokes a cigar.
