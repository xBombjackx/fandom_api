Summary
Daniel
sneaks into the room and sees photos of himself, as well as a wall with the crew heads taped onto it.
Olly Wang
’s head is crossed out, and the crew heads are numbered. He is about to leave when he sees
one of the streamers
blocking the doorway, the short one with an odd mouth. Daniel hides under the table with him as
Samuel
bursts into the room and then leaves.
Daniel decides to sign the contract since he didn’t get much information. Samuel gives the contract papers and the girls are eager to sign, but
the girl in the racoon outfit
snatches the papers and tells them to read beforehand so they are not scammed. After striking out some clauses, she hands back the papers and they sign.
Warren
brings some fried chicken for the girls but
Sally
tells them the girls are staying at their workplace apartment.
Like What
and
Hilarious
wake up later and find themselves in their room. They see a chat with foreign people typing, and a camera that won’t stop recording. They call for help and the girl in the racoon outfit tells them they should have read the contract more carefully, and to listen to the viewers requests or they will face consequences by the gangsters under their desk. Daniel wakes up in his own room to find he is locked, but when he calls for help he is hit on the back of the head with a baseball bat by gangsters. He passes out but remembers he brought his second body along as luggage.
