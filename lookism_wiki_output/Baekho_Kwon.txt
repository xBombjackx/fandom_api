Synopsis
Jake Kim Arc
Baekho makes his first appearance
episode 312
during Samuel's flashback.
[

]
The Hunt for Hostel
As
Tom Lee
is walking past Jerry, he reveals that Baekho is Jerry's father and says "A sword belongs in a sheath. Like your father...".

This implied that Baekho and Gapryong had a similar relationship that Jake Kim and Jerry have.
The Hunt for Big Deal
Jerry is reporting to Jake all of Lua's findings on the statuses of the pre-generation. There, it is revealed that Baekho died on the same day as Gapryong Kim.

Fighting Prowess
Not much is known about his fighting prowess in his prime (even less than
Gapryong Kim
who was the central figure of the entire generation), but it is known that the relationship shared with Gapryong was the same as
Jerry Kwon
and
Jake Kim
, and we know that with that Jerry Kwon is known/shown to have more physical strength, attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Jake, but Jake will still win the fights for 2 reasons, the 1st and main reason is that Jerry will never attack Jake and the 2nd is that Jake is much faster and more skilled than Jerry (even with Jerry mastering the fundamentals of Boxing and said by Manager Kim that he has no wasted movements and he is quite fast). So with that we can assume that while Baekho may have been more physically stronger, have higher attack potency, destructive capability and be more durable than that of Gapryong Kim, Gapryong Kim would still win the fight as he has every other stat going for him and Baekho would never have fought him. Also in chapter 456 it is shown that the strongman Jaesoo Noh who could kill boars with one ax swing with his forearm regretting and wishing hell for his luck that he got stuck with fighting with "Not fighting just anyone but Baekho Kwon's son", indicating how much of a monster in terms of strength Baekho Kwon was.
