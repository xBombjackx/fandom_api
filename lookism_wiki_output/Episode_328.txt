Summary
TikTacTok girl tries help Daniel but everyone around her is drunk. Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and orders her to get wasted as well. Daniel enters the room to find it's emptied out. Xiaolong tells Daniel he was expecting him to attack the third affiliate, and Jake knocks him out despite taking a heavy blow from Daniel.
Daniel wakes up in a hotel room where Vivi asks if he's okay. He asks why she cares about him and she tells him her dad said to befriend any billionaire's kid, so she can make friends. When he asks about TikTacTok girl Vivi says if he likes her he can be a part of the treasure hunt she set up with her friends. These rich kids invite influencers they fancy so they can assault them while they are unconscious. Daniel beats the guys and raises his fist at Vivi in anger when Taegon Wi, another Workers executive, throws a kunai at him. The other kids' guards rush in to say that Daniel isn't the son of a billionaire, but an unknown person. Daniel says the third affiliate is rejected from the four crews.
