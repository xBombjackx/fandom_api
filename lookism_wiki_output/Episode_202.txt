Summary
Jace and the sophomore Burn Knuckles are bloodied from the fight. Mark Sa attempts to call Vasco and Jace says they won't fight until Vasco gives the call.
Logan is intimidated by Hope, who is a lot bigger than him. He overwhelms Logan and slams him on the ground, causing Jay-Gal to panic. The God Dogs make fun of the animation department and try to step on the body pillow, but Logan places his arm there. Hope kicks off the band-aid and Logan begins to cry. He stands to fight and tells Hope not to disrespect the animation department to cover his embarrassment.
