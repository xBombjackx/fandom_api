Ep. 198
Daniel Park
(박형석 Park Hyung-Seok)
is the main protagonist of
Lookism
. He grew up in a poor single-parent household and was bullied for being severely obese. Unable to endure the bullying any longer, he moved to central Seoul, where he suddenly found himself in a second handsome body. Capable of transferring his consciousness between two bodies, he begins living a double life—an ideal school life in his new body and a mundane existence as a convenience store clerk in his original one.
His Alternative Body would eventually lead him into the underworld of Seoul's Generations. Disturbed by the amount of unchecked injustice, Daniel would take it upon himself to fight back and stop their illegal activities. He would get into many gang fights all around Korea against these criminal organizations, which include the
Four Major Crews
,
1st Generation Kings
,
HNH Company
, and
Workers
.
Currently, he is a student at
J High School
's Fashion Department and the head of
Allied
—his current goal is to stop
James Lee
and
Kitae Kim
from starting another generation of war.
Appearance
Daniel has two bodies. His original body used to be short and overweight, now he's a lot more handsome, tall and muscular, and his second body is of tall height, thin and handsome and stated to be the perfect body.
First Body
In his original body, Daniel is usually bespectacled, and short to the point only
Duke Pyeon
and
Crystal Choi
's original body near his height. Daniel is extremely overweight, which is why Logan calls him "Pikachu" (Dog in the anime).
Daniel's first body is deemed unattractive by most, if not all, the exceptions being Crystal and Zoe. In this body, he's exposed to the true nature of society. Daniel uses this body at night to work part-time at a local mini mart, which is why it's usually seen in his work uniform.
Despite the difference in weight and height, his first body gradually begins to resemble his second. After his fight with
Logan Lee
and the incident involving the homeless man who broke his glasses, Daniel's face is more striking, and he's noticeably taller and slimmer, measuring up slightly taller than
Zoe
in height. After intense dieting and training with Sophia, he loses over a hundred pounds, so his original body is practically identical to his second body, though it is shorter. After Gun's training, Daniel has grown very tall; nearing his second body in height. Daniel has also put on more muscle mass, making him look more defined, he looks really similar to his second body in chapter (424). His face looks quite identical to the second body as well. It was stated that he resembles a younger Jinyoung Park, and even his grandmother confused him as Jinyoung Park.
Second Body
Daniel Park first see's his second body
In his second body, Daniel has no glasses and he's taller. He has a healthy, athletic build and more physically attractive. This being his most notable trait, usually leaving women infatuated and men intimidated. Daniel's good looks make people think he is a famous model, idol, or star (which he eventually becomes) as they go so far as to ask for his autographs and pictures with him, much to his shock.
No one has ever been stated to surpass Daniel's good looks, and no one retains the center of attention as he does (albeit unintentionally), as a result, his second body is the most popular student at J High. He uses this body to attend school and it's usually seen in his school uniform, unless elsewhere.
Personality
Daniel is a very kind and friendly person at heart, preferring to avoid unnecessary conflicts if he can, but will help those in need even in dangerous situations.
Initially, due to being bullied, Daniel would take out his anger on his mom. However, he began to realize just how much she sacrificed for his sake, filling him with deep feelings of self-loathing and regret for his actions towards his mother to the point of vowing to be a better person. He often cries whenever he is reminded of how he treated her, such as when in his second body, he was asked to act out a certain role as a test to see his acting skills only for Daniel to cry while reading the script as the part was similar to a part of his life, he regretted the most. So as to not trouble his mother financially, Daniel is very humble and responsible as he does not bother with materialistic things unless they cut down on his or his mom's living expenses (e.g., rice cooker) and is willing to work so he can pay his own living expenses.
Daniel is also very sympathetic and protective of those mistreated, either because of their lack of strength or because of how unattractive they are, as he can relate to how both feel and is prone to stand up for them. Though it is implied in the Runaway fam arc he is respectful enough to not interfere in other affairs without permission.
Lack of self-confidence is often Daniel's biggest hindrance slowing his progress on his goal of trying to be a better person. In some cases, it leads to his being perceived as a pushover who is nothing but a coward. Fortunately, Daniel is constantly inspired by those who diligently work towards their goals, such as Euntae and Duke and is motivated to put more effort into overcoming his struggles to achieve his goals.
Due to his lack of social interaction with people around him prior to having his second body, he can be naive, much like Euntae, and is unsure how to act when placed under peer pressure. Likewise, he is easily deceived by perceived kindness. For example, he once accidentally agreed to become a host in a club and escaped the club while drunk. Moreover, he thought that Yui genuinely liked him for who he is while in his second body but was shocked when she treated him cruelly while he was in his original body. He also never smoked or intentionally drank before and didn't know how to refuse when putting under pressure to do so. However, this tends to create humorous situations and misunderstandings about him.
After temporarily losing his connection with his current body and being helplessly bullied by Logan Daniel regressed back into his old self before moving to Seoul. But after realizing that this world wasn't fair and how he needs to work harder to overcome that unfairness Daniel gets a way better appreciation for his old body and becomes more confident in it.
Daniel tends to become belligerent, overconfident, and apologetic when drunk.

In later arcs he is seen to also have an aggressive personality when in a tense battle.
History
Daniel was raised by a single mom, and they lived in poverty. In addition to his poor living conditions, Daniel was looked down upon due to his appearance, leading him to be bullied at school (mostly by Logan). No longer willing to put up with the bullying, Daniel's mother offered him a chance to transfer to a different school (Jae Won High). Daniel, unable to bear with his school troubles any longer, tearfully accepted.
Upon moving, Daniel's dreams of starting anew were quickly shattered by a humiliating defeat at the hands of
Zack Lee
, captured on video. With the video going viral, he cried himself to sleep only to awaken the next morning in a completely new body. He discovered the following rules:
He has to sleep to change bodies
If one body is forcefully awakened, the other body will go to sleep.
The sleeping body has to be cared for like an actual body.
He is conscious at all times (cannot have dreams).
In a state of lost consciousness, he cannot change bodies until the other body recovers consciousness.
The sleeping body experiences all physiological phenomena normal bodies do.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Copy Technique
Seoul, the land where monsters fight- he commands those monsters, a genius no one can defy. He is someone who rose from the bottom- the head of Allied.
Daniel is actually a natural-born fighter despite his lack of confidence and any formal training prior. Regardless of which body he is in, Daniel can memorize any technique down to its textbook mechanics after seeing it once and execute it with the same amount of competency as a skilled expert. In addition to this skill, he possesses incredible foresight in a fight, able to clearly see all attacks his opponents throw at him. Whether or not he is able to dodge the said attacks usually depends on his opponent and Daniel's current body. Daniels' ability to copy other people's techniques is so amazing that to others who fought Daniel felt like they were fighting themselves. Later on it was stated that Daniel’s ability to copy others Techniques were far superior to Johan Seong(Another copy cat genius) stating that Johan only imitates others while Daniel is the real deal (which correlates with him being as competent as a Skilled master in that martial art or field) In the more recent chapters whenever he copies a character his hair or physical appearance turns similar to them.Further his fighting senses were so accute that he was able to catch Gun (while in trainning) and DJ offguard while fighting them which proved his calm and levelheaded attitude even in strenuous situations. According to Gun, Daniel has the eyes to figure out his out his opponent, but he isnt able to use it to its full strength. If he focuses, he can see more. During Busan arc his copy ability in second body further developed and he could copy others move effortlessly but during his fight with Jinrang when he copied the moves of his opponent along with the techniques and moves of other kings he could copy them easily but couldn't genrate the same power .Jinrang mentioned that he could copy the moves but he could never copy the intents or its force due to not understanding its significance and hardwork required to develop them thus the power of those techniques were weak.
Original Body
Daniel's old body
While not on par with his second body, his weight does add an incredible amount momentum to his attacks unleashing them with such surprising force that he even forced Euntae (who possesses unbelievable strength) to resort to knocking him out when he felt he could no longer withstand his punches. He rarely ever fights in this body due to his lack of confidence while using it, but as the series progresses, he does become a more capable fighter, especially under
Vasco
's strict workouts and guidance despite him not being aware of it. In this body, he severely lacks the desired reflexes he gains in his second body. Despite being able to see the attacks (even once commented on how slow they were), he was still not able to physically dodge them due to this body's lack of agility and reflexes. It should be noted that if attacks are executed by non-skilled practitioners, even in this body, he has no problems defending against them. Despite its many shortcomings Daniel's first body still has impressive strength and endurance as he managed to take and multiple hits from Logan Lee and recover from the experience with no lasting injuries. even
chairman hong
was surprised that daniel took an attack from
sophia
and survived while most can not. With enough determination, his fat body could take out a person with little or no fighting experience.
Daniel trained his body becoming unrecognizable to most people in this new form looking closer to his second body than his first, even
Zoe Park
and
Logan Lee
did not recognize him as the transformation was extreme. The weaknesses his body had are now gone as his body is faster with the addition of Systema. he has high tolerance to drugs that the drugs that were in the cookies were ineffective. Later on, he is trained by Gun as a potential successor, making him a far more fearsome fighter, he is shown to easily beat a Workers Executive and even throw Xiaolung, who is known for being a powerful opponent to many. He is also seen countering Yuseong's attack by blocking his fist and using the other leg to kick him into the ground. He has gotten so strong to the point where Eugene even compares him to a First Generation King.
Original body after training (Episode 411)
In chapter 438, he was able to use "
Self-Hatred
" mode in his Original Body just like his Second Body.
In chapter 439, Daniel was barely able to copy the moves of James Lee, but he was not as fast as him. Jichang praised his strength and said he understood why seokdu lost and why taesoo got fired up. This may imply Daniel was on the level of Taesoo or Seokdu.
In Chapter 439, Gun Taught him about Subconsciousness by choking Daniel on the neck and gains an ability to use
Ultra Instinct
again just like his Second Body.
In the current arc as of chapter 453 it is known that he can take on someone on the level of Jichang Kwak (being superior to the same only when using the Ultra Instinct), who himself is stated that brute strength wise is on par with Gun Park (stated by Daniel Park himself), and Jichang Kwak was someone that even Elite (Charles Choi) was interested in becoming his bodyguard before he took Jichang's life.
It is also shown in the recent chapter that Gun mentioned that Daniel's copy ability was inefficent in his old body  earlier as he could not generate the same power while executing the techniques that he copied, but after his training with Gun his body became strong to such level that Gun mentioned that he could now easily imitate all the moves of Gen 1 Kings almost perfecly (including
Taesoo Ma's Fist techniques
).
In the recent chapter he copied
Kwak Jinchang's
Hand Edge Technique
perfectly while fighting Logan Lee and pulverised him thus defeating him easily.
When he used Ultra Instinct against his second body, it was stated that he and his second body was moving so fast that not even Warren could keep up. If Vasco, Warren and Jerry steped in the fight, they would die. He and his second body were using every fighting technique under they experienced so far, and given that they had the same movements and techniques, they could be mistaken as the same person. However, little Daniel was being pushed back due to the experience gap between the two bodies.
According to Gun Park, His ultra instinct (along with his second body) is fundamentally different from his. With Ultra instinct, he fights efficiently by adjusting to his opponent's combat power. He is mechanical with his counterattacks by returning an attack equal to the one he received. However, he does not have control over it. Due to that , when receiving the same attack the second time, he will give the same response each time.Futher in comparison to his perfect body he was inefficient in perfecting the power of the used  techniques
Gun Park mentioned that Daniel Park was his greatest masterpiece he ever created .
Second Body
Second body in UI mode
In this body, Daniel is among the strongest in the entire series. Even before he developed his technique and skill, he was able to defeat most opponents, solely relying on reflexes and instinct and is one of the few characters to naturally be on the level of skilled fighters with no prior formal training, the other being Johan. This, coupled with Daniel's ability to instantly replicate any fighting skill he sees just once, makes him one of the series' most formidable fighters by outdoing many others with their own fighting techniques.
It seems Daniel has become used to his abilities and immense fighting prowess in this body, able to dodge attacks merely on reflex with extreme ease, even while in deep thought. In some fights, he has found some attacks to be annoying.
His biggest testament to his fighting prowess is being one of the only people (the other being Euntae) that Jong Gun, a fighter of legendary status, acknowledges even once. Gun stated that, although Crystal was heading for a dangerous situation, if she is accompanied by Daniel and Euntae, then she's not in any real danger. However, he is not yet on the level of Jong Gun or Joon Goo, as he was easily defeated by Gun but in his UI state he fought a contolled UI Gun Park on equal footing in his hideout. Meanwhile, Euntae, his fighting equal, was soundly defeated by Jake Kim, who Gun promptly defeated.
So far Daniel's biggest weakness is that his compassion can often lead to unfair or synchronized fighters like Chuck Kwak and Justin Peng to overwhelm him. He also can't copy the determination that comes from the moves he copies, which makes opponents like Zack hard to fight.
Daniel's last trick is when he enters a state known as "Ultra-Instinct," in which he is rendered in a state between conscious and unconscious. He is able to maximize his fighting potential by utilizing every single move of his knowledge without hesitation. In this state he is so powerful that he is able to suppress Jerry Kwon and even able to break one of Gun's arms in their one-on-one fight. He was able to defeat 2 Crew Head (Jake Kim and Samuel Seo) simultaneously. He then proceeded to easily defeat Jerry Kwon and Lineman. After that, he completely dominated a raged Johan Seong in their fight. Although, he was not able to defeat Goo because he suddenly passed out, he still inflicted a huge damage on him. The downside of this state is that he is unable to control himself, making it difficult to discern between friends and foes.
In chapter 467, Gun has stated that Ultra Instinct was able to control (Gun Park can control UI) and the one who can control it can "adjust" their strength whatever they want. The one who aren't able to control UI will "adjust" their strength based on the opponents. For example, if the opponent is weak, UI will adjust its strength being weak for that opponent. If the opponent is strong, UI will just adjust its strength being strong for that opponent.
While he and his real body had the same techniques and movements, Warren states that Big Daniel had more experience using those techniques. Its as if he has more practiced and that little daniel was simply copying him.
In chapter 470
Jinyoung Park
said that Daniels strength is on the level of the ones whom the
Gapryong fist
was fighting against and he is way past the level of the 2nd and 1st generation and also said the he wanted to see Daniel and Gapryong in a fight this implies that he is around the level of
Gapryong Kim.
According to DG, Daniel and Gun share ultra instinct, but their fighting styles are different (possibly due to having different bloodlines). With Ultra instinct, he is more like a cool-headed machine. He uses sophisticated techniques to maximize his efficiency like a perfect weapon.which was a flaw as even an injured Gun Park defeated him in his Ulta Instincrt staye mentioning that until he controls it he couldn't kill Gun Park.
Druing his fight with Jangyeon Na he fought with a higher intensity owing to his training with Shiro Oni, he used  his Heat mode and Yamazaki Kyokushin Karate to overpowering King of Incheon shocking him and other spectators equally.
