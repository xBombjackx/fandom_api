Hangyeoul Baek (백한결)
is
Gyeoul Baek
's older brother and a minor antagonist in Lookism.
Appearance
Prior to undergoing experimentation, Hangyeoul was a tall, handsome man who resembled his brother, Gyeoul, enough for the latter to assume his identity.
In the present day, his body is taller and more muscular. He is always half-naked and wearing a mask that partially covers his features. Several lines of uniform stitching cover his body in a patchwork pattern, suggesting heavy experimentation.
After being injected by his brother, Gyeoul, his skin takes on a red hue as his veins begin to bulge, particularly across his face, even causing his mask to split into shreds from sheer exertion.
Personality
In the present day, he doesn't seem to have any personality, only acting in a bestial manner due to experimentation. He has lost his memories and can no longer tell friend from foe while fighting.
Prior to undergoing experimentation, he was a genuine and kind man, as well as an outstanding plastic surgeon who put people before money. Rather than taking patients who pursued superficial beauty, he only operated on patients who sustained injuries from accidents, even if it meant suffering financial loss. He also willingly volunteered to be the sole member on the staff of his father's Doctors for the Homeless program, where he endured horrible conditions to help the less fortunate.
This kindness would be so intense that it led him to sacrifice his life in an attempt to save a few crippled men from death when the program's site began to fall apart.
Relationships
Gyeoul Baek
Hangyeoul was a staunch supporter of his brother, standing behind him when he rejected his father's standards of beauty. The younger brother saw him as a pathetic man in return, though he would realize he was fond of his older brother only after the accident. Gyeoul would use his brother's words of support to justify his experimentation on him, as he wanted him to become a force that could protect his kingdom.
Synopsis
The original Hangyeoul Baek, he worked as a plastic surgeon at the Grimm Plastic Surgery Clinic, and at his father's Doctors for the Homeless Program. After the cut corners of the latter caused him to be injured gravely, he was resuscitated by Jinyoung Park as his brother stole his identity.
At some point, he participated in the Circus and became the leader, continuously winning fights to the death, at least before the arrival of
Sinu Han
.
Fighting Prowess
His fighting power was intended to be on par with Tom Lee's. He easily defeated Jihan Kwak, Jibeom Kwak, and Hudson Ahn.
However, it is confirmed that the comparison to Tom Lee was a heavy overstatement as when he lost to the combined efforts of Samuel, Johan, Jake, and Eli (No.1 couldn't even get a hit in as they were dodging and redirecting attacks as because they stated that if they got hit once they would be knocked out, and when Eli fought him in the basement, Eli said that he got lucky because of the terrain as he could hide within it and hit Hangyeoul without getting hit back, which shocked Jake as with how damaged Eli was without even getting hit),
Gyeoul Baek
used a drug that awoke him and got him stronger and Gyeoul stated that the drug could make Hangyeoul infinitely stronger to get to the level of Tom Lee which got Johan questioning about the fact that he will continue to get stronger and stronger to until he reaches that Tom's level.
