Summary
The girls working at James Lee crew's bar come to
Jiho
to complain about the work. The bar manager bursts in and apologizes for their behavior, swearing he will teach them better. Jiho asks how many of the girls are complaining, and pulls out one tooth for each girl. They beg him to stop and say they will stop complaining about the work.
Daniel
comes to
Jace
to ask about the James Lee crew, and he tells them that he wanted to pay them back for messing with the
Burn Knuckles
. Jace says he didn't tell
Vasco
because he is obsessed with beating bad guys, so Jace will do it instead. He tells the gang that
Ansan
is running a private bar in Gangbuk where only verified customers can enter, and they used underaged girls from the runaway fams to run these bars.
Daniel goes undercover in Gangdong with
Eli
and pretend to be runaway kids. It isn't long before they are approached by
Jacky.
Zack
and Jace are pretending to be customers at a bar to get information on the illegal bar. Zack asks the girl next to him how old she is. When she says her age, Zack tells her to go get the head of the bar. Jace is excited that they will be getting more information, but Zack punches the manager and says they will take over Gangbuk like the other gangs. Jace hopes Daniel and Eli are doing better, but Eli has decided to pick a fight with Jacky.
