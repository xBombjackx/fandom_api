Summary
Daniel
, in his new body, ponders on who he should tell about the current situation and he finally decides to rely on himself. He attempts to wake his old body up but after failed attempts, Daniel forcefully wakes his old body up with a harsh slap. He then wakes up in his old body and after a while, he learns that when one body is awake, the other body has to be asleep and that he has to come up with an even schedule. He finally decides to be in his new body during daytime while being in his old body during nighttime.
The next day, two schoolgirls are shown commenting on the looks of some of the schoolboys and they compliment practical music student Beom, stating that his dyed hair looks cute. They stop paying attention once they see Daniel, who is even more handsome. A girl, Soojin, even runs in front of him to catch a better glimpse. Daniel, unaware of the expressions of the people, hopes that he doesn't get bullied like he did before.
