Summary
The Burn Knuckles quickly recover and mow down the God Dogs. Jace knocks out Mark Sa, who assumed he was the weakest due to his status as an analyst. Jin Jang quickly surrenders to Vasco but he rejects his apology and tells him to stand up for his beating. He thanks Leonn for calling the rest of the crew, as he learned to rely on others.
Zack leaves the boxing ring and remembers a conversation with his coach. His advice was that Zack stop fighting with emotion, and that was the only way to beat his opponents. Zack remembers the coldness Johan showed him during their last fight and wonders if he can fight like that.
He returns to the ring to find Scott Kwon waiting for him. Scott harasses him and asks about Vasco, but he ignores him and starts training. When Scott hits Zack and he does not respond, the coach gives him his gloves, congratulating Zack on controlling himself. Zack puts them on and tells Scott to come to the ring.
