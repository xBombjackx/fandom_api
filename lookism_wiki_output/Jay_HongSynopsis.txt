Background
Jay comes from a very rich family, as shown by his expensive clothing.
He is tremendously wealthy, considering he gives a lot of his high-quality clothing and accessories to Daniel, as well as the size of his giant penthouse apartment. He is also very well respected by his butler and others. Jay is the second son of the H Group Conglomerate and the younger brother of
Kitae Hong
, who is the heir to the family's company. Jay seems to have a high position in the company.
Jay is shown to care deeply for Daniel, not hesitating to spend lots of money on him to support, and helps to protect him whenever he's in danger. It is strongly implied that he has feelings for Daniel, though this is not confirmed.
He is implied to have a strained relationship with his parents. His father criticizes Jay for getting into a fist fight and tells him to "don't ever call me again". He seems to have a good relationship with his sister, Joy. There haven't been many scenes with Jay and Kitae to determine the quality of their relationship. In the one scene both are in together, Kitae disapproves of Jay going to a "crappy" Jae Won High School and "dragging" Joy there.
Exposition
Chapter 4
He was first introduced in chapter 4, seemingly intrigued by Daniel's transfer.
Chapter 6
Jay listens in when two girls and Zoe were flirting with Daniel.
When
Zack
's friend insults Daniel's mother and Daniel tells him he's gone too far, Jay, Zack's friends,
Mira Kim
, and Zoe look surprised. Zack, however, is outraged because Daniel had made a fool of him in front of Mira.
As Zack and Daniel were about to fight, Jay showed concern towards Daniel up to the point of attempting to prevent Zack's punch from hitting Daniel. However, as the fight continued, Jay showed slight amazement at Daniels skills. Later, he is in the bathroom listening as three of Zack's underlings were discussing on how to ambush Daniel. He is then seen leaving the bathroom with slightly bloodied clothing leaving the three underlings injured behind him.
Jay Arc
Daniel greeted Jay gratefully recalling his efforts on stopping the fight, but midway received a call from
his mother
about his upcoming birthday. As this was happening, three of his classmates were talking about the possibility of Daniel being a beggar. On Daniel's birthday, Jay gave him a lot of expensive branded clothes. The next day, the same three classmates discussing about Daniel being a poor beggar were threatening to out him to the girls. However, when he arrived in the expensive clothing and as his classmates were complimenting him, Jay was seen with a smile on his face. At the end of the arc, it was revealed that Jay had tried to write a note to Daniel, wishing him a happy birthday and asking to be friends but had eventually just settled for a small tag with 'Happy Bday' written on it, which he gave Daniel along with the bags of clothing.
Festival Arc
(Chapter 25)
During the slave auction, Jay was at the stand attempting to pay $10,000 in order to help Daniel out and save him from a date with Lala Kim. However, he was denied since men were not allowed to buy in the auction.
Paprika TV Arc
(Chapter 29)
Jay was shown at the end with a small grin on his face after he won against Lala Kim for donations to Daniel and Duk Hwa when they appeared in a paprika liveshow.
Second Hand Rana Arc
When Nam Soo tells Zack that a group of con artists had stolen the money Zack had given him, Zack decides to pretend to be a buyer in order to confront the con artists. When Daniel goes to help Zack as well, Jay is seen listening in on them.
When Zack, Daniel, and
Euntae
were fighting the con artists, the con artists, fighting a losing battle, were waiting for backup from a group of freshmen.
Jay had passed by the freshman on his motorcycle and had incapacitated them in an alleyway. When two guys who used to be bothered by said freshmen showed up, they complimented Jay and told him not to smoke because, if he didn't, he would be able to get a lover. They told him that after they had quit smoking, both of them met someone. Jay immediately drops his cigarette (once again implying an attraction to Daniel).
Autumn Boot Camp
When getting on the bus, Daniel believes he would have to sit in the front next to the teacher. However, classmates wave at him, telling him to sit with them in the back. Jay is shown to take the seat next to the teacher instead.
Pavlov's Dog
When
Logan Lee
steals original Daniel's money, including the 5000 won bill Daniel's mother had given new Daniel, new Daniel explains to Jay that old Daniel was a special friend of his, so he had to get the money back. New Daniel introduces Jay to his mother as the friend of the fat Daniel. When Jay meets old Daniel for the first time, Jay acts kindly towards him and gives him a stick of gum (Jay had started chewing gum to stop smoking).
Old Daniel tells Jay that New Daniel had gotten the 5000 won bill from Daniel's mother, which she had earned by selling boxes. He also told him that new Daniel thought of the note as a lucky charm. Jay, remembering the generosity of Daniel's mother and the way new Daniel valued old Daniel, becomes determined to get the money back.
Jay then goes to see a manager of a branch (of either a hotel or a company). The manager is respectful towards Jay and says he hopes Jay will remember him kindly. Jay had asked the manager to look into Logan, and the manager explains that Logan is a notorious bully who is the same age as Jay. He also tells Jay that Logan is a Jujitsu black belt.
The next day, Daniel's mother receives heaps of cardboard boxes from a nearby hotel, and Jay goes to confront Logan about the money. Logan, laughing asks why everyone was asking him about money that day and if Jay was trying to mug him. He asks who sent Jay to collect the money, and Jay only took off his jacket in response.
Later, Jay is seen dealing consecutive kicks and punches to Logan. Logan realizes that Jujitsu doesn't seem to work on the style of fighting Jay is using, Systema, because Jay is fighting from further away. In order to force Jay closer, Logan takes out the envelope of money he had stolen from Daniel and threatens to rip it. Jay runs to save the envelope, only to be grabbed by the hair. Logan then begins to choke Jay using Popsicle.
As Jay runs out of oxygen and starts to go limp, Daniel in his new body runs to help Jay. When Logan tries to grab at Daniel, Daniel swipes the arm aside, running to Jay's side. Logan then realizes Daniel's strength as Jay had barely been able to dodge Logan's attacks earlier. Daniel had been resolved to fight Logan, but in front of Logan, this resolution wavered because of his fear. He began to make excuses such as fighting would dirty the clothes Jay had given him, and that he had to take care of the unconscious Jay. When Logan, frightened by Daniel, tells Daniel to leave, Daniel is relieved he doesn't have to fight, telling himself that maybe Logan's already spent the 5000 won.
When Jay gains consciousness again, he is alarmed and flustered to find himself being carried on Daniel's back. When Daniel tries to comfort him, telling him to calm down and that it's fine if they didn't get the money back because Logan's a famous gangster, Jay hands Daniel the envelope of money he had brought to give to his mother as well as the 5000 won bill.
Daniel feels ashamed that Jay had gotten the money back instead of him and starts crying. Jay, thinking that Daniel had started to cry because Jay was heavy and Daniel wasn't able to carry him anymore, gets off his back and offers Daniel a piggyback ride.
Later, when Daniel in his original body goes to exchange the dress that he had bought for his mother for a different size, the sales clerk tells them they can't exchange it because the dress had a stain. Daniel explains that the stain had been there when he bought it and that another lady was able to exchange her dress for another size even though her dress had a stain too. The sales clerk says that the other lady doesn't seem like a liar whereas Daniel and his mother, who both look poor, are probably trying to cheat them. Daniel's mother says that it's fine and that the dress was too good to wear anyways. The sales clerks laugh and say that it's for the best, and that they had probably been the ones to stain the dress.
Suddenly, Jay walks in and the manager asks the sales clerks the reason they're making a fuss. The manager apologizes to Jay and tells him it's not a big deal. Daniel then starts talking to Jay, who's worried about new Daniel's back. Daniel then asks why he's there, to which Jay may have responded that he was employed there. Daniel then assumes that Jay had worked there part-time when it is probably more likely that he owns the store. The other employees look shocked that Jay seems to know Daniel and immediately exchanged the dress for Daniel. Jay smiled as he walked away when Daniel thanked him. The manager and the sales clerks then apologize profusely to Daniel, offering them VIP status and hoping they would put in a good word for them with Jay.
Lee Euntae Arc
When Euntae offers new Daniel a box of chocolate milk, Jay silently observes, and, a while later, offers Daniel two boxes of chocolate milk.
Jay's Wallet
Jay rushes over to Daniel to help him with a question at school, accidentally dropping his wallet in the process. Jiho pockets it, trying to prank Jay.
Later, Daniel tags along when Jiho asks Jay to buy him some snacks in the hopes that Jay will notice the absence of his wallet. However, Jiho is disappointed to see Jay pay with his cell phone instead.
While in the bathroom, Jiho discovers a check for 10 million won in Jay's wallet and is immediately overcome with guilt for taking it. He resolves to return the wallet to Jay quickly and stealthily, but fails each time as he is ultimately too afraid of embarrassing himself by being noticed.
However, Jiho's backpack (with the wallet inside) is later stolen by a group of bullies, causing him to enter a state of panic. He runs to the convenience store where Daniel's original body is currently working and tells Daniel everything. Jiho and Daniel then confront the bullies at the playground, only for the bullies to beat them up. Daniel realizes that although he'd been able to clearly see every punch and kick directed his way, he was unable to do anything because his reflexes were too slow.
Daniel then returns to the bullies after changing into his new body, asking for them to return the bag. The bullies do so immediately and try to suck up to him.
After that, New Daniel takes Jiho to Jay's home. Joy, Jay's younger sister, opens the door for them. When they ask if Joy lives with Jay, she answers that her brother lives alone, but she comes over on occasion. Joy tells them that Jay has just left, but she'll text him telling him they're there. She mentions to Jay that Daniel is at the apartment, and his response is lightning-quick and very alarmed. Joy explains that he said he's coming back immediately, and comments that it's not like her brother to do so. She discloses to Daniel and Jiho that Jay had asked her to help him find his wallet. Daniel begins to tell her that they have Jay's wallet, but Jiho stops him in his tracks, not wanting to look bad in front of a pretty girl.
In order to subtly return the wallet, Jiho tries to throw the wallet inside of Jay's room but is hindered by Inu and her puppies, who are protective.
Jay comes home, sweaty from having run the entire way and holding a large bag. Upon seeing Daniel, he throws himself into a frenzy trying to clean every surface of the already pristine apartment. Jiho walks out of Jay's room after having successfully thrown the wallet inside (at the cost of being attacked by Inu and her pups) to see Jay, and notices that the bag he's carrying is full of stacks of 10 million won checks identical to the one inside the wallet.
Daniel says that he has a lot of those checks, too. It turns out that rather than being actual checks, those slips of paper are just promotional flyers for the online shop for which Daniel models. Daniel's picture is printed on the back. Jiho, realizing that all his effort was for nothing, promptly faints.
The arc ends with a cut to the previous day. Jay is offered a promotional flyer for the store for which Daniel works. People were throwing them away when they realized the papers weren't checks. Jay, however, turns his over to see Daniel's face printed on the back and smiles to himself as he slips it into his wallet.
The Stalker
When Daniel tells his classmates that he had a stalker, the news appears to worry Jay. He then presses a box cutter into Daniel's hands. Daniel looks surprised and wonders if he had lent it to him before. Jay also walks off with an obvious blush after giving Daniel the box cutter.
Later, when the stalker kidnaps Daniel and Crystal, Crystal is able to cut herself free from the restraints tying her up when Daniel slips the box cutter that Jay gave him into her hands.
Troubled Transfer
He sees Daniel shivering and gives him a concerned look. He glances at Logan Lee, which is the cause of Daniel's shivering.
Picnic
Jay is with Daniel, Zoe, Mira, Zack, and Joy at the school picnic. Zack tells Daniel that he's dead if they can't get a ride since he's late, and Jay sweatdrops. The group decides to ride Altan first, which Mira says is scary. Everyone ends up wearing something on their heads, and Jay and Daniel both wear cat ears and they are happy, while Zack wears Minnie Mouse ears, which he is embarrassed for.
On a ride called Disco Pow Pow that spins very quickly, Joy decides to throw herself at Daniel. Daniel and Jay are sitting next to each other, and Jay stares in horror. He ends up catching her by the face before Daniel can save her. Joy smiles and thanks her brother, but she is secretly frustrated inside. She tries again several times, but Jay caught her every time.

People around the two gossip and ask if the two were a rich couple. Joy wants to go somewhere that Jay doesn't so they agree that Jay will wait for Joy. Jay sits down somewhere and looks at the back of his phone. There's a sticker of Daniel wrapping one arm around Jay's shoulder on it. Jay smiles at it.
He sees the Drop Tower from the corner of his eye and imagines Daniel congratulating him on being brave for riding it. When he gets on the ride, he sees someone taking a selfie and chooses to also take a picture. However, it is unexpected when the ride starts, and Jay drops his phone and his wallet.
After the ride, he frantically looks for his lost items. Seonong mistakes him for a beggar and makes fun of him.

Seonong finds a pair of shoes and steals them, and they happen to be Jay's. He doesn't realize the shoes are Jay's and throws his old pair of shoes at him. Soomi and her friends see him, and he is wearing the old pair of shoes. Soomi thinks the shoes look vintage unlike the guys at school, which is ironic. He offers he a tissue for her bloody nose that she got while getting beat up by Crystal. She blushes wonders if he's flirting with her (he isn't).

With the help of people, he finally finds his phone and wallet, but they are damaged. Despite that, Jay is still incredibly happy and hugs his possessions.
Soomi is flirting with the churro stand guy, but she can't stop thinking of Jay. She wills herself to stop thinking of him however, because she thinks he is poor. A chairman passes by, and they acknowledge Jay as his brother, and Soomi finds in shock that he was actually rich.
The chairman playfully tells Jay that he should have been lying quietly, yet he dragged his sister to the school. Joy protests by saying she actually liked the school.
The chairman, otherwise known as Kitae introduces Crystal and Jay. They bow respectfully to each other. Soomi and the churro stand guy glare at them jealously.
