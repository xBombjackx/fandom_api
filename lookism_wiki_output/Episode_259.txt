Summary
In a flashback of that day, Jace and Johan are seated in a cafe coming up with the terms to the agreement. Jace is worried about Johan agreeing to fight for him because of he looks innocent and naive but soon he finds out that Johan is a vicious fighter, smashing people into the ground and stealing their shoes. He recalls that Johan never had a right-hand man compared to other gangs, and wonders what would happen to
Burn Knuckles
if Johan hadn't been betrayed by his gang.
Jace asks a Hostel member about where the girl is and is told she is at the tea house. He tells Johan and he decides to head over and beat everyone up. Jace protests that he needs a strategy, and when Johan refuses he reminds him that he is in charge. He comes up with a diversion plan: Johan will get information from inside Hostel and he will get the information externally. Johan is annoyed but agrees, and Jace is worried if impulsiveness will be a problem.

is frantically looking for
Mira
. He finds her but she refuses to show him her swimwear, causing him distress. Hostel A hears about Jace taking heading to the tea house, and the girl realizes Jace is coming to save her. Seth tells them not to worry, because Brett is the head of the tea house.
At the tea house Jace is disguised as a guy from the Workers looking for a girl. Brett offers him some of the girls he has and physically abuses them, pulling one by their hair. Jace tells Brett to stop and he reveals that he knows he is a member of the Burn Knuckles, and surrounds Jace with his men.
Brett becomes annoyed at the girl he is holding and tries to hit her with an ashtray, but the tray is kicked out of his hands by the other girl he sat next to, who is actually Johan in disguise. One of the men decides to sexually harass Johan, and Johan tells Jace he is done following the plan.
