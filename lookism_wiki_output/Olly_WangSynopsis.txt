Background
Olly Wang used to go to the same cram school as Sally Park and Heather. He was a smart kid whose immigrant parents pushed him to extreme lengths to be a good student. His parents were so overbearing that he felt like he was driven to insanity.

Olly became obsessed with Eli Jang after witnessing him destroy Backdoor. He did anything to get Eli's attention, stealing from minors and even robbing his own house. When Gun decided to destroy Hostel, Olly advocated for them and Gun decided to let them go, on the condition that Hostel becomes one of the four crews.
As revenge against Eli, Olly decided to kill his cat
Ryan,
but he was stopped by
Jerry Kwon
. As Jerry took Ryan and left, he was then grabbed and raped by
Darius Hong
, who went to prison for his crimes. Soon later, he met with
Jong Gun
, but he was told he was too weak to run a gang.
Gun decided to train Olly, and for the next 3 years he was the new leader of Hostel A. He cut all contact with the other members of Hostel, and maintained the point system that Eli Jang created. His goal is to find Eli Jang.
Plot
Olly Wang was first introduced in the
Runaway Fam
arc as the Big Daddy of Hostel. When

to Hostel A's headquarters, Olly decided to test James for the position of Uncle.

James beat
Chuck Kwak
in a fight, so Olly accepted him as an uncle. However, he also stole Olly's cellphones, and he ordered Moley to bring him back.
On his journey to find James he ran into
Johan Seong
, who asked him to help find Gun.

Olly began teasing Johan, so the two began fighting until
Jin Jang
and
Jerry Kwon
interfered. Olly offered to feed Johan to get him to agree to do business with them. He promised to pay the restaurant bill for the four of them but later decided to leave Johan to pay the bill.
Jin Jang offered to help Olly find Eli Jang if Olly can help him destroy the
Burn Knuckles
. Olly agreed, and the two formed an alliance.

In the meantime, Olly adopted a street kid who looked remarkably similar to Eli Jang. He raised the kid to be a criminal and even named him after Eli Jang. He wanted to raise another version of Eli because he was obsessed with the original Eli.

It is revealed that Olly's obsession with Eli Jang is based on the belief that Eli Jang was the only person that allowed him to feel something (this is later revealed as false when Olly comes to the realization that his feeling was due to guilt over Heather's death).
It is revealed after his death, that Olly Wang has been covering Hostel B's payments to Gun. He also made Gun promise not to kill Eli (he made this deal knowing he would have to be dead in order for Gun to fulfill it).
