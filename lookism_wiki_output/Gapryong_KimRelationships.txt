Jake Kim
Gapryong was Jake's father; however, Jake doesn't really take after him due to Gapryong's habit of leaving his wife and Jake alone. He treated his own family unfairly while being fair to others. This is one of the reasons why Jake harbors resentment towards Gapryong.
Kitae Kim

They are assumed to have a strained relationship, causing Kitae to partake in the murder of his own father. He was labelled as "the man who killed his own father". As shown when Kitae met Jake, Kitae harbors complex feelings for his father. As he implied that much like Jake, he harbors resentment for him, but also attachment. As shown where Kitae had collected the items Gapryong had given to his other children. As implied by him, Kitae had killed many of his half siblings after having asked them what they thought of their father, and upon not liking their answers, killed them.
