Vin Jin asks if he can join him, causing Akira to get stressed and deny him, kicking Vin's sunglasses off his face. Upon seeing Vin Jin's polycoria, Akira starts to mock Vin, enraging the high schooler and spurring him on and to fight and defeat Akira with ease, dislocating Akira's shoulder. What happened to Akira Katsuzawa after that remains unknown.
