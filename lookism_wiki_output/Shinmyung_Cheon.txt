Shinmyung Cheon (천신명)
is a minor character in Lookism, and a major antagonist of the
Cheonliang Arc
.
Appearance
Shinmyung Cheon has a somewhat odd appearance, with bushy eyebrows, a large forehead, small eyes, and M-pattern baldness. He normally dresses in traditionally-designed grey clothes and no shoes. While performing the duties of a Shaman, he dons a colorful red mubok (무북) with blue, green, and white accents, as well as a solid red gat (갓) with a gat-ggeun (갓끈) decorated with colored beads alternating between red and yellow. He also wields a sinkal (신칼) and a mubel (무벨), similar to real Korean Mudang.

Relationships
Vin Jin's mother
Vin Jin's mother was a target of the shaman's scam who he forced into becoming a maid by preventing her and her son from escaping the region. During her time serving him, Shinmyung is implied to have sexually assaulted her several times, likely from lust, though reasons related to vengeance may be possible. The shaman would ultimately strangle the woman to death in an act of rage.
Synopsis
In chapter 495, he was cornered by the visiting first-generation kings before given a chance to escape by his believers. He managed to escape by climbing all the way up to the cliff only to get beaten by Vin Jin mercilessly, knocking nearly all of his teeth out before almost strangling him to death. Though Vin would ultimately relent so as to not kill him, Shinmyung tried to retaliate by lifting a huge rock above Vin's head to bludgeon him to death. In the process, however, he stepped on the headband of Vin's mother, causing him to slip when Vin picked it up. After slipping, he fell off the cliff despite Vin's effort to grab him and have his head crushed by the very rock he tried to use earlier, as Taejin looked on in shock.
Fighting Prowess
The shaman has not been shown to be a fighter, instead relying on his bodyguards, the Kojima Brothers.
