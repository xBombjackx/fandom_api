Synopsis
Profile
Ryan was
Eli Jang's
pet cat from his childhood. When Eli ran away from home, he took Ryan with him. The two of them lived together on the streets before Ryan led
Sally
to Eli, who was squatting in her house.
Nothing much is said about Ryan other than that he is a stray cat that lives with Sally, and in most parts, is the comedic relief of the story, and appears in certain situations. Sometimes it appears as though Ryan is talking, but that is because he has a habit of meowing when other people are talking.
Eli gave Ryan the final letter of Hostel, and considered him part of their family. Ryan was almost killed by
Olly Wang
, but was saved by
Jerry Kwon
, who decided to adopt the cat. He is the one who gave Jerry the scars on his face, as well as
Max
.
Fighting Prowess
Ryan has shown exceptional strength even scarring the likes of
Max Kang
and
Jerry Kwon
. As Jerry has marked a scar on
Gun Park
, it is safe to assume Ryan is on par or relative to the latter.
Quotes
“Come here, meow!”
“Meow”
Trivia
Ryan is responsible for the L in Hostel, which causes
Olly Wang
great distress contributing to his development of an inferiority complex towards the rest of Hostel.
Ryan resembles a black bicolor/tuxedo cat.
