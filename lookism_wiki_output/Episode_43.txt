Summary
The next day begins when the kids go rafting. Won Bin notices the girls laughing at
Zeus
when he splashes them but complaining when he does.
Mira
gets suspicious of Won Bin, who keeps looking at her the entire trip. Won Bin goes to the teachers room and notices them drinking with the student's confiscated drinks. He is disgusted by their behavior and goes to find Mira.
Won Bin finds Mira in the store room helping Zeus lift some boxes. He tackles Zeus and they start fighting. Mira helps Zeus fend off Won Bin and he thanks her. Then he turns and starts acting creepy. Daniel finds in his old body a poster of Zeus as a sex offender, specifically a rapist.
The reason Won Bin had Mira's picture was because he wanted to find who was taking creepshots. He found Zeus hanging out near her and found him on the pervert website posting the creepshots. Zeus attacks Mira and tells her to take off her clothes.
