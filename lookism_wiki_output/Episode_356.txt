Summary
Jiho
tells him he did that and
Jake
slaps him, saying that the guy he attacked was weaker than him. Jiho tells Jake that he knows the reason he held onto him was so he could destroy the four crews. Jiho tells Jake that he has gotten help from
James Lee
of the first generation, and Jake tells him not to disappoint him. Jiho calls his officer saying he has nobody left to call.
At Gangnam,
Goo
and
Gun
are partying in costumes. Goo recalls that they used to party like that in Ansan as well, and Gun asks about the Ansan kids, who may have been a crew if they were in Seoul. In the Jung-gu district of Seoul, the
Ansan Public
gang arrive looking for James Lee. They enter a club and are unimpressed, except for
Jacky
who does not care. They chastise the girls, which brings the club owners running.
Hudson
explains that their club is terrible, and Jacky offers to teach the owners how to run a club. The men get offended and start fighting, but the Ansan crew defeats them easily. A newcomer arrives, and the Ansan crew welcomes James Lee.
