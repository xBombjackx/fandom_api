Summary
Warren and Eli start fighting, and Warren notices that Eli fights very dirty, poking him in the eyes and kicking him in his manhood. When Warren is knocked to the ground Eli grabs a sign to smash his head in, and Warren sees that Eli has the eyes of a killer. Max and Derrick manage to hold Eli back, and Sally tells all of them to get out. They stop fighting because none of them want to freeze in the cold.
Sally asks Eli why he is fighting over her and he says he wanted to try on Warren's uniform. He explains that he only liked the hide and seek game because that was when his mother payed any attention to him. Warren gives Eli his jacket and calls the fight between them a draw.
At Sally's cram school she finds herself surrounded by Backdoor members. Her friend Olly Wang tries to diffuse the situation but is beaten. Eli shows up looking for Sally, and the Backdoor members mistake him for Warren Chae. He beats them all and Sally thanks him and introduces him to her friends
