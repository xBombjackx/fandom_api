Summary
The next day, Namsoo nervously informs about the whole incident to
Zack
. Much to his surprise, Zack didn't scold him nor hit him, but in fact felt guilty for not taking the shoes himself.
Yui
then came and joined the conversation. Yui suggested the idea for Zack to try ordering from them again, this time with his own phone, telling them that although it's a fake phone, they will most probably will still be using it for a while due to the high cost. She also told Zack to change his profile picture into someone else who looked like a pushover, and they all decided on using
Jiho's
picture. Zack decided he would go and confront the thieves alone, but was surprised when
Daniel
volunteered after prodding from Zack's lackeys. The five of them begin to leave. Yui grabs Namsoo and says they should go as well;
Mira
, obviously worried for Zack, makes the excuse to go looking for books in that area.
Jay
also follows secretly on his motorcycle.
