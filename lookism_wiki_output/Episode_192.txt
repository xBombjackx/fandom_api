Summary
The homeless tell Daniel that they thought someone abandoned the bag, which is now devoid of money and his phone. A homeless man takes Daniel in and feeds him soup and gives him a place to stay for the night.
When Daniel wakes up, the homeless man is gone. He is found by
Moley
and his friends, a bunch of homeless kids who take him in. They show him how to shower and where to eat food. In a line he spots a man faking a disability and is disgusted. Moley is quick to tell him that there is no fairness on the streets. He decides to show Daniel another way to make money.
Moley tells him there is a homeless man who embezzled money; if Daniel can grab the money and return it, the company will give him a reward. Daniel is caught by the man, who is the homeless man from earlier.
