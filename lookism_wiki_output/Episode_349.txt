Summary
Eugene
tells the crews they should stop fighting each other.
Charles Choi
has used them for long enough and is planning to cut loose ends, possibly harming them in the process. However, the
Workers
know Choi's weakness. Eugene offers to protect the crews in return for helping take down Choi, and he offers 1 billion won.
Jason Yoon
asks what the Workers have to gain from this, and Eugene says they don't need the crews, they just want to get rid of loose ends. Eugene directs his offer to
Big Deal
and
Jake
accepts to fulfill his promise to
Samuel
.
Hostel
flat refuses the offer, saying they are family first. Eugene compliments their stupidity and Warren walks over to him.

Warren
menacingly before Eugene calls him off. Warren notices he is wearing a black badge, and
Sally
brings him back.
Eugene then asks
Johan
if he would like to join the Workers. Johan asks if he knew about the Pungsan drugs, and Eugene says he ran the ring with
Vivi
. Johan feints a punch and tells Eugene he will never join a gang, and he only arrived to beat Eugene in front of everyone. Eugene asks Johan why he missed his shot, and reveals that Johan missed because he can't see where Eugene is standing. The crew heads are shocked to learn of Johan's poor eyesight. He backs away but the Workers surround him so he can't leave.
