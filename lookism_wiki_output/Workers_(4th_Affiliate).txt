Synopsis
Episode 287
A streamer, Jamie, has a bruise on her arm and the viewers quickly point it out to her. The viewers also comment on the lack of sleep she was getting, and the high amount of food she was eating. One streamer tells her to pick up a strawberry if she was kidnapped, and Jamie does so. Some of the viewers are skeptical, while others are concerned for her. Under the table, two grown men glare at her and urge to her behave. The introduction ends.
Amy
and
Natalie
apply to a job at MCN. They get the job quickly after
Samuel
, the CEO, sees that they do not have a background. He introduces them to the five most popular Kwitch streamers, which the two girls find strange.
At school,
Daniel
holds up the One MCN card that
Gun
had given him and observes it, wondering what he should do.
Doo Lee
walks up to him, fascinated. He says that he had been trying to get into streaming. He watched Doo Lee stream, but the viewers are not happy.
At home, Daniel tries it again in his old body, and instantly gets many people to watch him. He shows them what a loser he was in school, and the audience finds it relatable.
The next day, Daniel goes to MCN in his new body while carrying his old body in a suitcase. He has a brief encounter with Samuel, who confirms that he is a member of
Workers.

Episode 288
Samuel
admits that he is a member of the
Workers
, which stands for “The Union of One Hundred Billion Dollars”, and that their goal is to make that amount. He asks
Daniel
if there is a problem, and Daniel has no response. Samuel gives him an interview and says he wants Daniel to work with them since he is great at building an audience. Daniel tells
Doo
that he is going to the J Star convention where big streamers meet, and Doo tells Daniel he owes him something.
Like What
and
Hilarious
look around in awe at the convention, and then race to the table of the top five Kwitch streamers, the “Royal Five”. One of the five members,
a girl wearing a red panda suit
, tells them not to trust the company too much. Daniel comes into the building and greets the two girls, but they don’t recognize his fat body.
Samuel looks at some pictures of Daniel and wonders if he will cause trouble to the Workers. Daniel asks to see what is in the room and Samuel tells him not to interrupt, and then goes to the bathroom. Daniel tests the voice recognition of the door but it doesn’t work. Then he pulls out the ONE MCN card
Gun
gave him and the door unlocks.
Episode 289
Daniel
sneaks into the room and sees photos of himself, as well as a wall with the crew heads taped onto it.
Olly Wang
’s head is crossed out, and the crew heads are numbered. He is about to leave when he sees
one of the streamers
blocking the doorway, the short one with an odd mouth. Daniel hides under the table with him as
Samuel
bursts into the room and then leaves.
Daniel decides to sign the contract since he didn’t get much information. Samuel gives the contract papers and the girls are eager to sign, but
the girl in the racoon outfit
snatches the papers and tells them to read beforehand so they are not scammed. After striking out some clauses, she hands back the papers and they sign.
Warren
brings some fried chicken for the girls but
Sally
tells them the girls are staying at their workplace apartment.
Like What
and
Hilarious
wake up later and find themselves in their room. They see a chat with foreign people typing, and a camera that won’t stop recording. They call for help and the girl in the racoon outfit tells them they should have read the contract more carefully, and to listen to the viewers requests or they will face consequences by the gangsters under their desk. Daniel wakes up in his own room to find he is locked, but when he calls for help he is hit on the back of the head with a baseball bat by gangsters. He passes out but remembers he brought his second body along as luggage.

Warren Chae
asks Daniel if he saw
Like What
and
So Funny
, Daniel tells Warren about what's happening to them, Warren says he will beat the Workers but Daniel stops him because it's too dangerous. Warren gets mad and tells Daniel he has 3 seconds to tell him why he shouldnt beat them. Daniel asks
Kouji's
help to how he can get it without causing any ruckus, Kouji tells him about how badges work in
Workers
and tells him that the badge he have is called the Black Badge which means that badge is only for the VVIP. Daniel gets in the ONE MCN building and meets
the Worker's President
.
Episode 292
Daniel
tells
the president
that he wants a tour and wants
Mr. Kim
as his tour guide. Daniel asks Mr. Kim where they locked the minor streamers and Mr.Kim says he doesn't know what he's talking about. This causes the other members of
Workers
to laugh as well, and Daniel asks where
Samuel Seo's
office is.
Warren
tries to climb all of the stairs until he realizes that there must be a secret floor on the building. He gets in the elevator where he saw Mr. Kim and asks him where Like What and So Funny are. Daniel gets in Samuel Seo's office and meets
Goo
in there.
Episode 293
Goo
asks
Daniel
if he got the badge from
Gun
, and he asks what Daniel did for Gun in return. Daniel says he agreed to be Gun's successor, and
Goo
asks whether he was supposed to get rid of the four crews. He tells Daniel that if he becomes his secret friend, he will let him know how to defeat the Workers. When Daniel refuses, Goo tells him he will respect his wish, but he dislikes liars. He flips Daniel over and knocks him out.
The president
puts on a fight for
Doo
to watch, where he makes the security team fight each other. Doo is impessed and intimidated by this gesture.
Warren
fights
Senior Manager Kim
in the elevator. Manager Kim asks where he learned Jeet Kune Do. Warren asks how he can do this kind of job while being a father, and Manager Kim says he will do anything for his family.

Amy
and
Natalie
.
Episode 294

beats
manager Kim
and asks how he could allow this to happen. In a flashback,
Daniel
tells
Warren
and
Doo
he expects to be caught and that in case Warren should cause a ruckus. Daniel's small body frees the girls from their cells and they go to every imprisoned streamer to save them. On his way out he runs into Mr. Gold, who instead of helping him, punches him the face. He takes off his wig and smirk and reveals that he is the president of the company, and he wanted to keep an eye on Daniel from the start. He wonders where Daniel got a black badge, since he asked the VVIPs and none of them confirmed. He asks if Daniel is conspiring with
Samuel
behind his back, and brings the security back to round up the streamers.
Warren and Doo are brought to the president and he berates the security team again on their mishaps. He beats up Samuel and tells him he should be grateful for all he has done. Daniel shows up holding the beaten security guards and greets everyone before informing them that they are disqualified for illegal actions. The president asks how Daniel can prove the illegal matters. Daniel throws the illegal contracts in the president's face, and tells him that the Workers are disqualified from the four crews. He managed to get these files by using his black badge on the locked safe.

if that's why he is so calm. Samuel says he wants to show respect to the one who raised his bosses. Tom asks if Samuel knew he would be there, and he refuses. Samuel thanks Daniel for being his cameo, and he tells
the president
no hard feelings. Tom decides to take the president with him.
