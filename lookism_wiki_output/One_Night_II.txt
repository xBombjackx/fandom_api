Synopsis
Episode 320
A rich Chinese girl gets high on LSD, and a cleanup crew covers her tracks to make sure she doesn't get caught in her hotel room.
Outside, Brekdak gives his stand to Vasco to make money, and Vasco sells fish sticks to his costumers. He meets a variety of people, including "Jane Kim," who is Jake in disguise. When the Chinese girl takes food, but doesn't pay the 500 won, Vasco realizes it and tries to go inside the club to get payment.
Jake, who entered the club, sees Old Face and decides to talk to him. Just then, Vasco, who is getting confronted for entering the club without the security guard's permission and is demanding payment, causes a stir and distracts everyone. This causes a fight to break out between him and some of the guards. Ho Hwang challenges Vasco to a fight.
Episode 321
DJ Chaerin notices the fight breaking out with Vasco and Ho Hwang, but decide to just crank the music because the people are enjoying it. Old Face interrupts them and tells the guards he will handle the situation, and Jake is annoyed he missed his chance to talk to him. Jake suspects that Vasco doesn't stand a chance against Old Face, but Vasco has gotten stronger and easily knocks him out. Ho Hwang congratulates Vasco's strength.
Jake takes Old Face to a bathroom and ties him up. He sticks a toilet paper roll in his mouth and threatens to pump water down his throat if he doesn't reveal Sinu Han's location. Old Face tells him that he doesn't know where Sinu is, but he knows something else thats valuable. The girl in the stroller from earlier is Vivi, the president of the third affiliate and the daughter of a Chinese billionaire. She runs Hotel Vivi and Club Vivi. She is currently in the Workers because she is a drug addict, and drugs laws are more harsh in China. Old Face also tells Jake that her bodyguard is called Xiaolong, and his loyalty and the guards' loyalty is towarsd Vivi above all else. Xiaolong is rumored to be as strong as Gun, and the other bodyguards are as strong as the crew heads. Jake decides not to interfere with Vasco's fight, because he is not strong enough to lead a crew.
Vasco is currently losing against Ho Hwang when he tells him that he has learned a lot about winning from bad guys: he has to use his most lethal move first. He grabs Hwang's face and uses two of Brekdak's forbidden moves: No. 7 (Dough Kneading) and No. 8 (Rice Bag Smash). Jake approaches Xiaolong guarding a door and asks if he can speak with him in English, knowing that Xiaolong only speaks Chinese, and will probably only fight him.
Episode 322
Xiaolong responds to Jake in Korean asking if he would step inside, and he is dissapointed he didn't get a chance to fight. When he enters the room a chicken foot is thrown at the wall by Vivi, who is angry that Xiaolong sent an unattractive guard to her. Jake realizes that they mistook him for someone else and decides to play the role, introducing himself as a member of the White Tiger Company. He fakes details about Tom Lee's life and says he thought he would have met Sinu Han during his interview, saying that the two of them are lovers. Xiaolong mentions that he is No. 8, and Vivi tells Jake that their love was not meant to be given that the numbers are kept secret. Jake tries sneezing his name and playing a song about Sinu, but they are interrupted when Johan arrives and introduces himself as the intern from White Tiger Company.
Vasco continues to fight the guards, breaking one of their legs with Brekdak's Forbidden Move No. 6. Johan recognizes Jake, and he attempts to leave but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar. Brekdak enters the club wondering what is taking Vasco so long.
Episode 323
Brekdak asks Alexander Hwang, who is now working as a valet at the third affiliate, to step aside. Other Workers members ask what is going on, and he explains that Brekdak is looking for someone. They tell Hwang they were going to report him for running a food truck without a liscence, and Brekdak backs off to save his business.
Jake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer and find more information about Sinu. Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen.
The two of them confront Vasco, and he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo. The three of them decide to fight each other.
Episode 324
Xiaolong reveals that he gave this test to Johan and Jake believing they would lose to Vasco. He does not trust the White Tiger Company, because the
chairman of the Workers
is using them to spy on the third affiliate, and he does not want any of his men in the club. Johan is fighting well using his taekwondo. Jake remembers a time he and
Jason Yoon
ate together, and Jason mentioning wanting to fight a powerful taekwondo fighter from Gangbuk, a guy whose moves resemble Johan's. Jake is surprised at how much stronger Johan has become, and becomes more resolved to get the position.
Johan asks Vasco why he isn't fighting back, and Vasco says he has been fighting back. Vasco recalls Brekdak telling him the past that if he ever comes across a genius fighter, he should beat him before he has the chance to copy his attacks. He gears up to use Brekdak's 10th Forbidden Skill and Johan readies a 1080 degree kick, but Jake grabs Johan by the leg and tells him that his 10 minutes are up. Johan asks if he can do as much in 10 minutes, and Jake says he can win in 10 seconds, giving Vasco his 500 won so he can leave. Johan is about to be fired but Vivi protests, saying Xiaolong is jealous of his looks. Xiaolong surprisingly allows Johan to stay with them, disappearing into an underground passage.
Steve Hong is impressed by Daniel's weight loss, and Sophia cries tears of joy now that Daniel has lost enough weight to go undercover.
