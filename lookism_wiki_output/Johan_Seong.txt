”
— Johan Seong,
Ep. 242
Johan Seong
(성요한 Seong Yo-Han)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He was a childhood friend of
Mira
and
Zack
, as well as the leader of
God Dog
. He also used to be one of the successors of
Gun Park
. During the reign of the God Dog, he ruled all of Gangbuk, but after the gang's collapse, he refused this position. He also makes an appearance in
Taejun Pak
's another webtoon Questism as a secondary character.
Appearance
Johan has a child-like appearance, a lean and slender physique; when he cross dressed, he was said to have nice hips.

Johan's hair is styled into a brown mullet, with bangs barely covering his eyes. His eye color is black; however, it has been noted after the
God Dog arc
that his left eye has started to turn gray, signifying his growing blindness. which was possibly passed onto from his
mother
.
His attire once consisted of a black hoodie with the God Dog logo on the back, but ever since the disbanding of the group, he is usually seen wearing dark clothing, boots, and a cap. In the past, he wore two wish bracelets, one to wish for his mother's eyesight to get better and the other to wish that he'd be able take care of Mira forever, but gave them both up after the
Cult
and
God Dog
arcs.
He has been referred to as handsome and hot.
Personality
Johan is first introduced as a timid child in love with
Mira
, his friend; similar to his other friend,
Zack Lee
. He was shown to care more for others than for himself, allowing himself to get beaten up by bullies to avoid getting in trouble for the sake of his mother. When he was younger, he was very obedient and cared dearly about his mother and Mira. He was also very faithful to his religion.
During his middle school years, Johan had low self esteem and thought of himself as a loser, ostracizing himself from his only friends, Mira and Zack. He overcame his jealousy by beating Zack in the boxing championship, only to completely disappear from their lives soon after.
After the incident with the cult, Johan turns more reserved and cold. He has a bitter view of the world and believes power is the most important thing. He cannot stand optimistic characters like
Vasco
who have a bright worldview, and he takes defeat to such characters personally. However, it is implied by Vasco that the reason he is so cold is because he is lonely and is afraid to trust in others.

Johan is stubborn, especially when it comes to other gang members. He can be commanding, as demonstrated when he did not hesitate to order around two members of Hostel after he defeated them
[

. He can also be incredibly childish when jealous of others,
[

as seen in the 'One Night' arc where he teamed up with
Jace Park
and became evidently jealous of Jace and
Vasco
's close friendship as described by Jace, going out of his way to prove his own worth. His selfishness is cited as a major character flaw by both
Gun
and
Jin Jang
,
[

the former giving it as the reason why Johan was disqualified as his successor.
Although Johan claims that his only family are his dogs, Eden and Miro, it's implied he still cares about his mother. This is seen when he continued to go back to her hair salon, despite her deteriorating vision meaning he never got a good haircut. Which also  caused her to continually think he was Zack instead. Also the fact that he formed a crew to pay for his mothers cornea transplant.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Copy Technique
Johan is a member of the fearsome Four Major Crews and is the leader of the crew "God Dog". Jace has stated that Johan, unlike the other crews, never needed a right-hand man or extra muscle to back him up.

Johan's true potential was always held back because he did not want to cause trouble for his mom by fighting. However, he finally decided to reach his fighting potential in order to save his mom from being stoned to death during the
Cult arc
.
Much like
Daniel Park
, Johan is another character (the only other one besides these two is
Jinyoung Park
) in the series who has been shown to be able to execute a technique perfectly just by having seen it once. This is shown when Johan mastered Zack's jabs just by seeing it in action once. A few years later he would use that very technique to save his mom's life, by jabbing stones thrown at her before they hit her. However, unlike Daniel, he seems to stick with the first fighting style he learned (boxing from Zack) and has only improved upon it, whereas Daniel switches between various fighting styles to better suit himself in a fight.
Johan uses the same fighting style as Zack - boxing, heavily relying on speed and bursts of power to increase the force of his punches. Johan's talent even surpasses Zack, someone who has trained in boxing since he was young. He is faster than Zack, as stated by many characters, and was the first to beat Daniel in a race (albeit Daniel had run 3 miles prior to their race). He defeated Zack in a boxing match as his punches were too fast for Zack to dodge.
As displayed in his fights against Gun and Eli, he seems to lack the natural build of a fighter. While he looks like he has a weak physicality, he is actually quite strong.
[

]
, despite his build seemingly being more suited for speed. Johan can unleash all his energy in a single moment, creating immense burst power and strength enough to forcefully open a locked steel door, as seen in the
Animal Cruelty
arc.
Gun
, a legendary fighter, chooses Johan as a candidate for his successor, but later disqualifies him. However, the only weakness he faced was that his physicality was lacking in comparison to his skill. Gun himself compares Johan to a computer with "software (that) is cutting edge but... hardware from the 90s", stating that in that regard, he is the opposite of Vasco, who possesses poor skill but high physical abilities.
Ever since his defeat at the hands of Gun, Johan has increased his physicality to the point where he could overpower
Seth Lee
in a contest of strength (someone who can bend metal rods with his thumb) while copying
Vasco
. He has also managed to copy
Jake Kim
's MMA flip, which he used on
Goo
.
Despite these advances, Johan's eyes have degraded to some extent as well, whilst this doesn't cause a dramatic reduction in his fighting abilities. This led to him missing an attack on Zack Lee.
In Chapter 421 Johan gains the ability to imitate Daniel by using all of his muscles and nerves for a limit of ten seconds.
In the fight against Yuseong, Johan ended up being able to copy CQC (after a brief exchange with Manager Kim) and made Yuseong pass out with a combo from it (after the fight and wanting to take out Eugene). Also, the fact that Johan was having such an effect on Yuseong pshycology, Eugene was wondering if Johan was powerful beyond measure and that he might be stronger than Tom Lee .
Johan's Infinite Technique
The Infinite Technique
This technique was the amalgamation of all the techniques Johan copied before his fight with Gun. The Technique is totally unpredictable and fluid as it was catching Gun Park off-guard. On getting inspiration from Tom Lee before
"Hunt for Gun"
Johan's fighting style improved a lot he fought on almost equal footing with an injured Gun using his
Copy
, who was still hard to be defeated, with his temporarily improved vision he almost sent Gun to his death point. Gun noticed that Johan merged his countless copied techniques into a single fighting style which caught even Gun Park off-guard. Gun reached the conclusion that Johan has finally found his own path and named this fighting style the
Infinite technique.

Trivia
His name in English strictly translates to "St. John", which is notably a character in
Jane Eyre
.
He is the only one of his friends to have asked for two wish bracelets, both of which are broken, but neither of which came true.
Johan has a soft spot for animals, and is often seen with his dogs Miro and Eden.
Despite stating that that he hated dogfights, Johan was seen using a human shield, and dirty boxing during the One Night arc.
After God Dog arc, his left eye consistently becomes drawn as gray. This is later revealed to be the fact that Johan is going blind, much like his mother.
Johan is implied to have learnt Taekwondo from
Seong Taehoon
, a character of Viral Hit, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.

Johan's distant relative
Haru Seong
used to cut their hair at his mothers shop but stopped cutting their hair as his mother is now blind, Haru Seong is a character from
Questism
, another manhwa in the same universe as Lookism.
Johan was requested to aid and did aid
Suhyeon Kim
, the protagonist of
Questism
, because he was indebted to
Haru Seong
in some way. This significantly impacted the story of Questism.
