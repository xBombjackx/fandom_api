THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND
Allied (
얼라이드
)
is a crew created by
Daniel Park
right after the
Hunt for Big Deal
ended. He founded it with one goal in mind: the downfall of the
Workers
, the last of the
Four Major Crews
that was still standing. Their goal later shifted to stopping evil in Korea. Allied also joined the fight against
Gun
where they all lost.
After
Charles Choi's
death, Allied and members of the
1st Generation
went to Busan under
Diego Kang
and
Kitae Kim's
plan.
Organization
The Allied crew has no hierarchy; as Daniel has stated in the past, the members are not his subordinates or lackeys but rather equal allies (hence the name). However, Daniel is seen as the de facto leader of the alliance as he is the one calling the shots against the
Workers
.
History
With the prospect of the Workers finally uniting the
Four Major Crews
, Daniel realizes that they become a threat that he can no longer take on alone. He wasn't going to let the Workers be and continue to grow in power, He decided to create a crew, with the only goal being collapse and eventual eradication of Workers.
Their base of operations takes place in an abandoned Youth Construction warehouse for the Burn Knuckles. Daniel arrived at the scene with
Zack Lee
and
Vasco
already waiting for him inside. After seeing how strong the Workers were during the
Hunt for Big Deal
, the two agreed to join his crew.
Daniel thanked them once again for joining his cause and introduced to them two more members of Allied. While they were cautious about him joining due to his social status, they welcomed
Jay Hong
to the crew. His reason for joining was to find out why Big Daniel disappeared and thought the Workers had something to do with it. The second member to join was a bit more controversial, Zack and Vasco exhibited discernible signs of discontent and dissatisfaction stemming from memories of the torment inflicted upon them during the events of the
One Night III
Arc, it was no other than the crew head of
Ansan Public
,
Hudson Ahn
. Zack and Vasco show reluctance to be associated with someone seemingly aligned with their past tormentors, Daniel explains to them why he asked him to join and tries to speak up in defense of him, However, Hudson cuts him off halfway through. He explains that he's not here to apologize or seek revenge, he believes that his crew already paid the price for attacking Seoul and he's here for revenge against Eli Jang. While they still were hesitant to let him join, after thoughtful consideration of the dangers they face as a result of their goal of bringing down Workers, they reluctantly accept Hudson's inclusion in the crew. Thus creating the Allied Crew, with its original 5 members, with the objective also to find clues where Daniel's other body was hidden by
Jinyoung Park
, one of the Pre-generation.
After the events of the
Holidays 2
and
Funeral
Arc,
Jihan Kwak
and
Jibeom Kwak
, respectively the No.1 and No.2 of the Chungcheong crew, started to help Daniel and the rest of the crew in their pursuit of eradicating Workers, as both vengeance for the death of
Jichang Kwak
, and vengeance for both
Eugene
and
Charles Choi
. They agreed to work together with Daniel and the rest of the Allied crew for the time being in order to locate
Jinyeong Park
to strategize their revenge against
Charles Choi
for killing
Jichang Kwak
and
Bakgu Noh
.
The Allied is also helped by
Jace Park
, the No.2 of
Burn Knuckles
, who acts as their tactician by providing them with information's and strategies.
And a few chapters after the
Lookism
Arc begins. Despite being rejected in
Episode 444
, Daniel was able to persuade
Vin Jin
, another very powerful figure, to join their cause as a new member of the Allied crew after presenting him the profiles of the
First Affiliate'
s Executives they will fight in their goal to abolish workers.
Alexander Hwang
began to help the team trough the Workers First Affiliate as their navigator in exchange for his freedom, putting the building's floorplans to his back.
The team is also working along with
Big Deal's
Head
Jake Kim
aiding each other in their respective goals and
Hostel
's Dad
Eli Jang
who, convinced through the efforts from
Vasco
, defected from the Workers and decided to trust the Allied by assisting them in order to defeat the organization. And by extension, also their respectively right arms Big Deal's No.2
Jerry Kwon
and Hostel's Uncle
Warren Chae
, who also defected from the Workers, associated themselves with Allied.
Busan
Daniel Park
was contacted by
DG
who told Daniel that another Four Major Crew was operating in Busan and that the appearance of
Jinrang
had united the crews. Learning this, Daniel contacted all the members of Allied and took them to Busan to take on Busan's Four Major Crews. Allied uses Vasco's connection to
Seonong Ham
in Busan to know of Choi Bongpal, one of the heads of a major crew and the one who cultivated an illicit drug business. Daniel made Allied impersonate as people from
Club Vivi
and spent enough money from Jay to convice Choi Bongpal of his identity as Club Vivi. Allied went to Choi Bongpal's hideout where they found illicit drugs and, having their cover blown, threaten Choi Bongpal of having all the drugs burned.
Choi Bongpal shows up and Allied used a very accurate Lie Detector to find her motives, she decided to help Allied as she can simply take over a crew after Allied dismantles it. She revealed intel about
Four Crews Of Busan

Fighting Capabilities
The main crew itself is very well rounded and versatile, able to eliminate and knock out a large number of fighters, including some powerful and strong fighters like the Busan Crew Heads students and the Executives in the first affiliate.
Members and Associations
The Allied were established by
Little Daniel
himself, not just to eliminate the threat imposed by
Workers
and
Eugene
, but also stop
Charles Choi
and find clues where his other body was. After the events causing the destruction of the First Affiliate, the Allied had entered a no-aggression truce with the Workers to work towards taking down Charles Choi together.
To form the group, he first approached Vasco, who readily accepted the offer, and Zack Lee, who had just returned from training at a Buddhist temple, making them the first members to join. He also invited Jay Hong, who was searching for Big Daniel and had seemingly retrained under
Sophia
, as well as Hudson Ahn, who sought to confront Eli Jang after undergoing training with
Taesoo Ma
. Both accepted, officially establishing the team.
Jihan Kwak joined the group as well, agreeing to spy on the 1st Affiliate by infiltrating the Ambulance Response Squad, while Jibeom Kwak also became associated with them. Jace Park played a key role as the team’s tactician, providing valuable information and strategic planning.
Vin Jin initially refused to join until he discovered evidence of
Taejin Cheon
—another member of Cheonliang whom he had believed to be dead. Holding a personal vendetta against him for
Sujin Kim
’s murder and for causing the King of Cheonliang,
Seongji Yuk
, to commit suicide, Vin ultimately decided to join.
Alexander Hwang
allied with the team to help guide them through the Workers’ 1st Affiliate building. Additionally, Jake Kim and Jerry Kwon, who were seemingly wanted for the riot caused by Eugene, as well as Eli Jang and Warren Chae, who had defected from the Workers, all came to an agreement to help Daniel Park and Allied if they reach out to them.
West Gangbuk High
In the epilogue of
Questism
, another manhwa in the PTJ Universe, the Master Card reveals to Kim Soo-hyun that a "great evil" is emerging, and he will need allies to stop it. This revelation leads to the alliance between West Gangbuk High and the Allied, bringing in several formidable fighters. Among them is Gukja Yang, a distant relative of Gun Park; Hajun Gu, a promising boxer with talent on par with Zack Lee; and Jaehan Han, who assumes the role of advisor for the West Gangbuk High crew. The team also includes Yugyeom Na, a quiet yet immensely powerful kickboxer, and Haru Seong, a formidable capoeira fighter with the rare ability to copy techniques—though not to the same extent as Johan Seong or Daniel Park.
