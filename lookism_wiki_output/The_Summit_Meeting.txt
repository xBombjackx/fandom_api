Episode 347
DG
confiscates the cookies from
Daniel
and is too fast for him to take them back. He feels Daniel up and recognizes that he is Daniel Park. Daniel is surprised because he hasn't met him in the little body. DG asks Daniel if his secret move was taught by
Sophia Alexander
. DG eventually decides to give the cookies back to Daniel because he intends to meet
Steve Hong
himself. He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know. Daniel returns the cookies to Steve Hong, who is disappointed. Steve tells him that he won't reveal this to the public, because
Vivi
is the daughter of the chairman of T Group. He tells Daniel not to waste his money, because he will need it for the second affiliate.
Vivi and
Xiaolong
are living in rural China where
Goo
dropped them off. Vivi tells Xiaolong that if they keep a low profile, eventually her father will approve of their relationship. They say they love each other, and Xiaolong asks for Vivi to fetch him a blanket. Waiting for him is one of T Group's Cheon guards, Jiou Jeon, who takes Xiaolong away while stating there is no way for the two of them to be together. Vivi returns to find him gone.
Zoe
tells Daniel that he looks similar to his second body now that his baby fat is gone. They are interrupted by
Arin
who is now a Kwitch streamer. Zoe is jealous and calls Daniel a player.
Back at the hotel,
Eli
tells
Sally
that Xiaolong and Vivi were in love with each other, and she feels envious of their romance.
Warren
sneaks up on her with his ninja skills he learned from
Manager Kim
. Warren tells Eli that he brought a letter addressed to him. In the letter,
Olly Wang
invites everyone in Hostel.
Episode 348
Hostel
deliberates over the letter, and
Eli
decides they will go regardless of whether it is a trap. They arrive at the meeting place, which looks just like
Sally's
hotel building. When they arrive,
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
are there to greet them. They accuse Sally of being the cause of
Olly's
death, and Eli tells them to direct their ire towards him, the leader. The next to arrive are
Big Deal
, who look more intimidating than before.
Johan
from
God Dog
arrived before both gangs, and is sitting in the shade of a staircase.
Jerry
tells Chuck that he had better not be calling Jake out for no reason, and he is surprised to see
a black guy
behind him who is even taller than him.
Samuel
finds this amusing, and Jake asks if
Workers
got an invitation as well. Samuel reveals that they were behind it, and Jake says the workers leader will probably hide behind his phone again, but the leader corrects him as he walks down. The crew heads are surprised by how innocent he looks, and he introduces himself as
Eugene.
Episode 349
Eugene
tells the crews they should stop fighting each other.
Charles Choi
has used them for long enough and is planning to cut loose ends, possibly harming them in the process. However, the
Workers
know Choi's weakness. Eugene offers to protect the crews in return for helping take down Choi, and he offers 1 billion won.
Jason Yoon
asks what the Workers have to gain from this, and Eugene says they don't need the crews, they just want to get rid of loose ends. Eugene directs his offer to
Big Deal
and
Jake
accepts to fulfill his promise to
Samuel
.
Hostel
flat refuses the offer, saying they are family first. Eugene compliments their stupidity and Warren walks over to him.
A guy in a cap
stands behind
Warren
menacingly before Eugene calls him off. Warren notices he is wearing a black badge, and
Sally
brings him back.
Eugene then asks
Johan
if he would like to join the Workers. Johan asks if he knew about the Pungsan drugs, and Eugene says he ran the ring with
Vivi
. Johan feints a punch and tells Eugene he will never join a gang, and he only arrived to beat Eugene in front of everyone. Eugene asks Johan why he missed his shot, and reveals that Johan missed because he can't see where Eugene is standing. The crew heads are shocked to learn of Johan's poor eyesight. He backs away but the Workers surround him so he can't leave.
Episode 350
Eugene
tells the crews he expected these results, but it doesn't matter, because any crew that doesn't side with him will be eliminated.
Mandeok
punches
Johan
into the ground as he says this.
Warren
gets angry and decides to fight the Workers, but
Jerry
gets up to defend them and the two start fighting.
Eli
tells
Max
and
Derrick
to protect
Sally
, and
Jason
and
Brad
start fighting the two of them. They say they won't attack
Sally
.
Jake
tells Eli he has no hard feelings towards Hostel, but he must protect his own. Eli gives him a collar choke but
Samuel
steps on him, causing him to fall on Jake's face. Jake lets Samuel and Eli fight and is annoyed that Eugene is just watching all of this. He sits out of the fight and so does
the guy wearing a cap
. Johan is being choked by Mandeok when
Zack Lee
comes out of nowhere and kicks Mandeok in the head, dropping him.
Vasco
uses
Brekdak's
fifth move (a kick) on Jake. Eugene reveals that he sent a letter to the
Burn Knuckles
, but he wasn't sure if they would arrive. Everyone grows silent and fearful when
Daniel Park
enters the building, and he wonders why everyone is putting pressure on him.
Justin
and
Chuck
attack Daniel saying this time the outcome will be different, and Daniel spins and slams both of them out of the way.
Episode 351
Samuel
and
Eli
are grappling. Eli asks Samuel why he is holding back, and Samuel asks Eli what he wants. The chart he was looking at earlier with
Jin Jang
was the chart of crew heads he had to get on his side.
Jake
tells
Vasco
that he shouldn't change and become a bad guy, and Vasco rejects this notion, preparing to slam him with elbows.
Eugene
tells
Mandeok
to test
Daniel
, but
Zack
interrupts and starts monologuing about how he loses despite trying his best. Mandeok punches him but Zack gets up as though nothing happened, saying it is comical how often he fights without winning. He then does an instinctual spin that Daniel recognizes from his ultra instinct mode. Zack tells Mandeok the reason he keeps losing is because he tried to get rid of negative emotions, when he should have gotten rid of all emotion entirely. Eugene tells Mandeok to ask his name, and Zack introduces himself as a wimp. Daniel takes the chance to lunge at Eugene, but
the guy in the cap
stops him. Daniel senses that he is the strongest one there.
Episode 352
At his private high school,
Eugene
mentions it has been three years since he met with
Charles Choi
and the others to start
the four crews
. He thanks
Mandeok
and
the guy in the cap
for protecting him like
Gun
and
Goo
have protected Choi, and calls them his friends. He is surprised
Zack
hasn't gone down yet, and also by how dirty Zack is fighting. He is doing all kinds of underhanded tactics like headbutting, hitting below the belt, and pivot blows: the tells of dirty boxing. Eugene tells them to stop fighting because Zack passed his test.
Jake
asks
Vasco
if he is really going to do a move that could kill someone, and Vasco tells him that he was the reason Vasco ended up this way.
Jerry
intercepts his elbow blows but injures his hand from the force.
Warren
left the fight with Jerry early because he was disappointed Jerry would not fight with all of his strength. They all stop fighting to watch
Daniel
fighting with the guy in the cap. Daniel's systema is barely keeping up with the other guy's speed. He tries to do a spinning kick but the guy grabs hold of him and pins him to the ground. Eugene tells Daniel he wants to talk to him, and he will tell him about
James Lee
in return.
Episode 353
Daniel
tries to act as though he doesn't care about
James Lee
but
Eugene
calls him out, saying he must be interested in the identity he was given. He says he will tell Daniel more about James Lee if he joins the
Workers
, since Daniel could be useful in defeating
Choi
. Daniel refuses, saying he has seen too much about the Workers to ever work with them.
Johan
regains his vision and kicks
Mandeok
, asking
Zack
why he decided to help. Zack says he doesn't remember the reason, and Johan decides to help him fight.
Hostel
have united with
God Dog
and J High, and
Big Deal
have united with the Workers. Eugene asks
Eli
where
Yenna
is at the moment, and Hostel's two nieces. He also mentions
Johan's mother
, the
Burn Knuckles
and Daniel's friends
Zoe
,
Mira
and
Joy
. Daniel tells the others to not fall for Eugene's bluff, but they are all scared. Eugene says he is willing to not harm the hostages if they hand over Johan. Daniel refuses and says that he will go in Johan's stead. After the meeting, everyone rushes home to find everyone is safe.
Warren
is angry that Eugene was bluffing all along.
Samuel asks Eugene why he didn't just fight them there, and Eugene says he thought of something fun. He asks why
Samuel
was talking to Eli, and Samuel says Eugene should trust him. Eugene then reveals that he was not bluffing about hostages, that his men were just on standby and not in action. Daniel is given a gold badge and an office, along with a kitsune mask. He reveals that he did not join the Workers to help them, but to destroy them from the inside.
