History
The
Seokdu Staffing Agency
was founded by
Seokdu Wang
, the 1st Generation King of Suwon. Contrary to its name, its dealings were less savory in nature as it hired out its members as thugs to accomplish various goals, from demolishing street vendor stalls to chasing tenants out so an area can undergo redevelopment.
After Seokdu retired, he passed the Agency down to his successor, Changyong Ji, who took Dosu Lee as his vice-head.
