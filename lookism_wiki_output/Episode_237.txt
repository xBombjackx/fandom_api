Summary
Sally begins spending her food on her new roommates, causing her to miss school. Olly and Heather visit often, Olly because he admires Eli and Heather because she has a crush on Eli. Warren worries that Sally is running out of money, and to quell his fears Eli hands Sally a large stack of cash. Warren is shocked and asks where Eli got the money, but he won't tell them.
Olly follows Eli and asks him to show how he earns money. Eli shows him how to break into cars and steal money, and Olly is amazed by Eli's street smarts. He tells the crew he knows how to make money, and suggests they rob houses instead of cars. He even has a specific house whose patterns he studied. Warren is against it but Eli agrees with Olly, and they all go to rob a house.
When they enter the house Warren begins having second thoughts and is consumed with guilt. As he is about the leave Olly shows him the jewelry he found that they can sell. Eli compliments him but they are interrupted when the parents return. The father brings a stick and prepares to beat them but Olly intervenes and takes the hits so they can run. The father stops in shock as he realizes he hit his own son, because the house Olly decided to rob was his own.
