Fighting Prowess
Sang Baek's combat strength has been compared to that of the 1st Generation Kings by
Diego Kang
who stated that he was more dangerous than the leaders of Busan's Four Major Crews. As the number 2 of the Jinrang Gang, his strength is second only to his leader. He has shown to be very fast as he was able to lightly stab
Daniel Park
in the stomach without him noticing and then easily block
Jay Hong
with one hand while talking to Diego and beat him with his cell phone until he was left unconscious on the ground.
