Crystal
, who she believes is more beautiful and powerful than she is.

History
Originally from the countryside, Aru came to PTJ Entertainment to try become an idol to help financially support her family. Aru found it extremely difficult and just barely passed the weight test, going to rather extreme measures to make it.

Even then, no manager wanted to help Aru become an idol so Aru desperately went to an older 'sugar daddy' and mob gangster, Jin, to help her achieve her goals. Even though this meant that she would ditch Lasol and cheat on Oliver, Aru was still determined to 'reach the top'.

Oliver hates her now and barely talks to her even though he is still fond of the times they spent together and how much they truly treated each other with love and care. He was still eager to help stop her 'sugar daddy' from forcibly taking nude photos of Aru and damaging her reputation because he understood how much her past self wanted to become an idol and support her family.

Lasol
Lasol and Aru used to be best friends and cared about each other deeply. Since Aru had to keep the fact that she and Oliver were dating a secret, they used Lasol as a cover to make it look like they were just friends. Now, Aru had cut her ties with Lasol because she thinks that Lasol despises her and knows about her talking to her 'sugar daddy' even though in reality, Lasol doesn't actually despise Aru.
