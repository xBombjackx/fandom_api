Summary
Seonong
arrives in Seoul with the intention of returning
Vasco's
money. He dresses nicely to fit in but his stature makes him look like a gangster. He runs into
Brekdak
, a foreigner who is being harassed by his boss. When Seonong tells off his boss Brekdak kneels to him and gives him his mongkol, causing
Leonn
to think he is harassing a foreigner.
Seonong lunges at Leonn and saves her from a falling object, but she thinks he is attacking her. He tells her he is going to pay Vasco and she prepares to fight him. He runs away from Leonn and hides in a parking lot. He finds out his money is gone.
