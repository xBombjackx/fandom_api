Summary
The thugs recognize Jace and want to beat him, but they are intimidated by Vasco, who they don't recognize. They take Daniel to the alleyway and ask if he and Jace are friends. Daniel isn't sure but Jace appears and claims him as a friend. The thugs attack him and he beats them easily and tells Daniel to come with him.
During the time the thugs were expelled, Goo met with
Gun
for a partnership test. Both of them passed and began collecting money from the
four crews
. The bullied kid became a bully after the entire incident. Jace and Vasco each get personal tattoos as well; Vasco gets one called "Hero Man" (Jace) and Jace gets one called "ET" (Eun Tae) to remember their best friends.
