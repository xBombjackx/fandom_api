Summary
Johan rescued his mother from her being bound on the cross and went with Zack to save Mira. Cutaways ensued showing that the priest used hallucinogens to convince Johan's mother to convert herself away from Christianity. Johan and Zack fought their way towards Mira. However, the priest was guarded by his dogs and had a bucket of meat to coax his dogs. Since Johan and Zack were stuck at an impasse, they were hesitant. Mira then bit the priest in the leg buying enough time for Johan's mother to suddenly douse the priest in a concoction that lured his dogs to eating him alive.
The reporter from earlier called in the police and took over the case. Zack comforts Mira and Johan's mother was taken to a rehabilitation center leaving Johan alone once more. Afterwards he goes missing only to show up during the boxing completion that Zack was also participating in.
