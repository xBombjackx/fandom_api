Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
He is known as a natural grappler, as when he was fighting
Hudson Ahn
he was using his grip to overpower Hudson, he was mentioned to have great grip strength as it even made it difficult for Hudson to fight back, even almost killing him by skewering. He is amazingly durable with great endurance and tolerance to pain as he got punched by Hudson directly in the face with a fist that could make a large crater in a boulder and took the attack smiling and laughing saying that 'this is it', 'this is the Ansan'. But his main style is the Hand-Blades style, his side of his hand is amazingly powerful as it was evenly matched with a full right straight and was even a little bit stronger. He was eventually overpowered by a (belief/Taesoo Mode) Hudson Ahn but it was an extremely close fight.
