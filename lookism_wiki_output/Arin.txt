Will I really be able to make money this way...?

Arin, better known as TikTacTok Girl, is a minor character in Lookism introduced during the
3rd Affiliate
arc.
Appearance
Despite her poor background, she is described to be a pretty girl. She sports long straight black hair with black eyes and a pointy head shape. She has clear fair skin and sports a slender figure with a curvy waist. Similar to
Daniel
and his
mom
, she wears worn-down clothes with stains and tears everywhere, with the only decent thing in her wardrobe being her school uniform.
Personality
Arin is a polite young girl with a drive to support herself. With no parents, she works day and night to support herself financially. However, due to her passive nature and good looks, she is often the target of desperate guys who think they can take advantage of her. She never wants to cause trouble even in uncomfortable situations she is often put into. However, after Daniel stood up for her and gave he a suggestion to enter the streaming world, Arin found a new opportunity to support herself and put her drive and effort into her online career, which paid off in the end.
Relationships
Daniel Park
TikTacTok girl was at first grateful for Daniel protecting her from creeps. Following the events at Vivi's Club, they became friends and fellow Kwitch streamers.
Zoe Park
While they have not interacted for long, Zoe was suspicious of TikTacTok Girl's relationship with Daniel, and assumed that he was a player.
Synopsis
TikTacTok Girl came from a poor background. Not much is known about her past, but Doo Lee and his coworker surmise that she has likely been mistreated by men in her past due to her looks and her status.
