Summary
Johan Seong
used to be childhood friends with
Zack
and
Mira
, going to church and school with them. He was a very religious child like
his mother
, and tries to please her by not fighting. However, he still gets bullied in school because he is poor and weak. Usually Zack saves him from his bullies, and Johan is embarrassed whenever Mira sees this because he has a crush on Mira.
The reason Johan refuses to let his friends visit is because his mom is delusional. His mother after a period of time lost her sight and while losing her sight she entered a cult for a dog god. His mother rants about being one of the chosen for the 666 and becomes violent, and he doesn't want his friends to see her in that state.
