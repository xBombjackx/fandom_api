Summary
Zack
and
Mira
go to the movies together and watch a romance film. Mira gushes over the main character who is a gentleman, and Zack resolves to be like him. When they run into some old members of her church, Zack tries to be polite to them. One of them laughs at him but the other one is just as polite and Zack gets intimidated.
When one of the guys trips him and apologizes Zack decides to forgive him. However, he then goes to hit a kid and blame it on Zack. He keeps it in to avoid embarrassing Mira. He overhears them talking about Mira in the bathroom and loses it, and decides to fight with his broken arms.
