—Shintaro Yamazaki  in
episode 520
Shintaro Yamazaki is the twin brother of Shingen Yamazaki and the former President of the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
He was the mastermind of birth of Shingen Yamazaki's children (including Gun Park)n order to produce forces for the next generation following the Syndicate's defeat against Kim Gapryong's Group. He was originally the older brother of Shingen Yamazaki who was fated to be head of the clan but didn't become one due to the midwife's scheme.
Appearance
Shintaro  Yamazaki is seen as a tall lean like man but is muscular, he has fairish skin like Shingen, he has a jet black colored slick back hair style similar to Gun's, he has broad shoulders, he is very handsome, has features like Shingen. He has Tiger tattoos too, except it doesn't cover his chest and torso part but at his sides and arms and down to the legs.
He is usually seen using a white Kimono and a white Haori with a black crest of the Yamazaki symbol, he also uses light grey Hakama pants, white tabi socks, and white geta clogs and he is usually see with a black fan that he is either holding or tucking it in his Hakama pant's waist area.
Personality
Shintaro himself is noted to be exceptionally intelligent and capable, to the point that many in the Yamazaki Syndicate believe that he should be its leader.  However, Shintaro is a staunch believer in the Yamazaki Syndicate’s rules and traditions to a fanatical degree. As shown, Shintaro is extremely devoted to his twin brother Shingen. Having viciously refused the offer of the three Branch Family Heads of the Yamazaki Syndicate to become the new head of the clan due to his brother’s lethargy and proceeded to brutally execute them for betraying the syndicates traditions.  While he acknowledges that his brother’s lethargy is determental to the orginization as a whole and him taking over the syndicate would beneifit and restore the syndicate to its former glory, Shintaro never the less continues to insist to follow the syndicate’s rules despite the degredation and weakening of the group as a whole.
A serious man who places the Yamazaki Clan's rules above all else, even commanding a young Gun Park to kill his son for dissuading him from becoming the next Clan Head. As noted by the Branch Family Leader’s who he executed, him ordering the death of his own child had a deeper psychological effect on Shintaro than he initially believes and he may feel subconscious remorse at having done so and this has lead him to become even more fanatical in following the Syndicate’s traditions and rules. Later on knowing the truth about his birth, he gets completely broken down mentally and goes on to kill Shingen to become the family head
As shown, after the truth of his birth was revealed, Shintaro immediatly felt immense guilt, despair and sadness at the death of his only son Haruto. Shintaro truly treasured and loved Haruto and fully acknolwedged his competence and skill as a leader and knew that if the Gun had become the next head of the Yamazaki, Haruto’s supporters would likely revolt. Hence, the need for Haruto to die to preserved the syndicate and the rules and traditions Shintaro held so high. with Shintaro being able to initially maintain his sanity due to believing it was for the greater good of the syndicate. But when the truth was revealed to him on how he was the true firstborn and the true heir of the syndicate, Shintaro immediatly realized that Haruto’s death was in vain and that as his own first born son, Haruto was always meant to be the heir.
This guilt of throwing away his son’s life for nothing completely distabalized Shintaro’s psyche. With him choosing to become the head of the Yamazaki clan due to him clinging to the rules and traditions he held and put the utmost importance in since the day he was born in order to avoid the despair of how pointlessly he had thrown away the life of his only son. With Shintaro even admitting that he never wanted to be the head in the first place and that he had only done so due to the “rules” demanding that he take the position. Upon successfully taking the position however, Shintaro admitted that this only brought him more despair and made him feel emptier as time went on. As shown from Gun’s return to the syndicate years later, Shintaro had already become suicidal and had long since decided that he wanted to die while still within the “rules” he followed and valued so much; by having Gun kill him and take his place as the new Yamazaki Head. In the end of his life, Shintaro was relieved to have finally escaped the rules of the Yamazaki he had lived under for so long and died content leaving everything to Gun.
Relationships
Haruto Yamazaki
It is seen that Shintaro doesn't have that much mercy on Haruto, as he was the one that made Haruto kill himself, as it was because he managed to make Gun see the bright side of things and almost turn down the role of the Yamazaki heir. When he realises that Haruto's suicide was a vain cause on learning the secret of his birth he completely breaks down.
Shingen Yamazaki
It is shown that Shintaro is dedicated to Shingen and even turned down the role of being the Yamazaki leader, as he said he will never break that Yamazaki protocol of the fact the oldest child gets to be the heir but on realising the sceret of his birth he gets a psycophathic trigger to kill his brother to follow the rule of the eldest child becomes the clan head. He also stated that he would correct the wrongdoings of the former oyabun and will become the clan leader himself.
Synopsis
During birth both Shintaro and Shingen where born as twins but due to the Midwife's scheme Shingen became the eldest son and by succesion order he became the President of Yamazaki Syndicate,which was by birth right the position of Shintaro, even as the vice president of the syndicate he worked hard for the syndicate and helped it to flourish,their birth secret was known by former Yamazaki president and their father,Yamazaki Shinji, but he made no correction to this mistake as everyone thought Shintaro had no
reverse eyes
which
was the distingushing  feature of the family head( not succesion by birth).
After the rebellion of the vassal families of the syndicate, When Shintaro came to know the truth form the midwife and the former oyabun he conspired against Shingen with Park Somi and even stabbed Shingen by manipulating Park Somi,killed the former oyabun killed the nameless descendants of Shingen who were protecting him and revealed that he also had Ultra Instinct.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Ultra Instinct
Like all Yamazaki Family Members he also has black bone and Ultra Instinct that he could control on will ,unlike Shingen and Gun who where always in
Reverse Eyes
mode further his speed ,fighting prowess is somewhat equivalent to that of Shingen and he also has impenetrable Black Bone. He also had same raw strength as Shingen and easily twisted the necks of Shingen's nameless children and crushed their skulls easily. Though, like his younger sibling, he inherited UI since birth. He is also proficient with Akido which helped him to fight on par with Shingen, he is also proficient with blades and katanas.
Years after Shingen's death and his rise to leadership of the Yamazaki Syndicate, Shintaro became immensely powerful, where even though he fought in a carefree and depressed manner, he was able to overpower Gun Park, who had been training in Korea for years. Therefore, it is impossible to determine his true strength, since, even while fighting Gun in his cogenital "Oni" Ultra Instinct state, he was merely reflecting on his entire life and decisions with remorse. Even more so, he forced his own death by forcing Gun's fist to pierce his stomach.
