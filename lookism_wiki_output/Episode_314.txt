Summary
Jake doesn't believe that Sinu would sell Big Deal to the Workers, but he doesn't see through the lie yet. He tries to beat Sinu into shape, but he is too easy on Sinu. He beats him proper and tells him that he did sell the crew, for 100 million won. The leader of the workers actually decided to rate him 1 billion won, for his prowess against Goo. Sinu asked to raise it to 1.2 billion won, to last them one year. Sinu continues to egg Jake on, even saying that he doesn't need the girls because Gangnam girls are more attractive. Jake tries his best now, but he is still too weak, and is knocked out by Sinu.
Sinu gives Jake his jacket, and makes his way to the Workers. Their leader tells Sinu that he will now be considered property, and no longer allowed to contact anyone. He is now No. 8 in the Workers, and his office is a giant cage.
