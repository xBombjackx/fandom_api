Summary
Hostel
deliberates over the letter, and
Eli
decides they will go regardless of whether it is a trap. They arrive at the meeting place, which looks just like
Sally's
hotel building. When they arrive,
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
are there to greet them. They accuse Sally of being the cause of
Olly's
death, and Eli tells them to direct their ire towards him, the leader. The next to arrive are
Big Deal
, who look more intimidating than before.
Johan
from
God Dog
arrived before both gangs, and is sitting in the shade of a staircase.
Jerry
tells Chuck that he had better not be calling Jake out for no reason, and he is surprised to see
a black guy
behind him who is even taller than him.
Samuel
finds this amusing, and Jake asks if
Workers
got an invitation as well. Samuel reveals that they were behind it, and Jake says the workers leader will probably hide behind his phone again, but the leader corrects him as he walks down. The crew heads are surprised by how innocent he looks, and he introduces himself as
Eugene.
