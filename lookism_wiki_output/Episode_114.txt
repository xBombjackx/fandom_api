Summary
Daniel wakes up the next morning to find that all the dishes in the sink were clean. He is confused because he doesn't remember cleaning the plates, but blames it all on the diet, saying that he's been rather forgetful lately. When he leaves to go to school, he sees the girl shivering outside his front door. She calls out Daniel's name and makes small talk with him. He wonders why she is sitting in the cold and realizes that she's eating something as well, but he doesn't comment on it.
She suddenly holds out her hand and asks if Daniel likes her ring, the same ring that she had shown her childhood crush. Daniel tells her it looks really pretty and asks if she's made it herself. Just when she's about to ask him another question,
Zoe
shows up, offering to walk to school with him. The girl grows jealous of Zoe, who doesn't notice and hands her a hot pack. When they leave the girl remembers how Daniel had told her to go back home and believes Daniel would love her alone. She then takes out the key to his home, saying that she'll listen to him and return to their "love nest."
When she enters Daniel's home, she says "I'm back," as if she were returning to her own home. She then smiles that hes's used her dishes, which she licks clean. The girl goes to fold the sheets, only to find original Daniel sleeping in them. She gets angry and grabs a kitchen knife to kill him.
