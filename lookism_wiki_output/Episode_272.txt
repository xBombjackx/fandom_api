Summary
Olly and the Hostel A uncles have sent someone to deal with Eli and Warren when they arrive in Gangdong. Meanwhile, Daniel and Zack continue to fight. Zack feels overwhelmed by Daniel and wonders if he is a genius, because he isn't a natural fighter like Daniel and Johan. Daniel's weakness is that he doesn't have the willpower of a fighter, and that keeps Zack fighting as long as he can.
In jail,
Jake Kim
wonders how Jin Jang will fare against J High. He sent Jerry Kwon to deal with Zack and Daniel if Jin Jang needs assistance.
