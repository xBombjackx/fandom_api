Summary
The juvenile detention guards are chatting about their worst inmates when one of them brings up Gun Park. He used to fight the most violent inmates every day, staining the walls with their blood. Jake Kim surpassed him though, making the bloodstains even higher.
Xiaolong gets beat into another flashback. He remembers Vivi giving him his name Xiaolong, meaning “Little Dragon”. Vivi wanted to befriend Xiaolong, but he never had time for her because he didn’t want to indulge in her feelings. She even confessed to him but he apologized and said he didn’t deserve her. Xiaolong eventually became a eunuch so he could protect Vivi without her father’s suspicion.
Jake breaks Xiaolong’s two arms, and he tries to attack with his mouth. Jake grabs hold of Xiaolong and warns him that if he continues, he may never walk again. Xiaolong says he never intended to walk away from this battle, and Jake breaks his legs.
Jake opens the door for Vivi and tells her they are leaving. Vivi says that she isn’t leaving without Xiaolong and she sees him broken on the ground. Xiaolong crawls to Vivi and she runs to embrace him. Vivi and Xiaolong cry together, and he barks like a dog. Samuel hears him and smirks.
