Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
He is stronger than his older brother Jibeom Kwak (as he effortlessly defeated him to become his oldest brother Jichang Kwak's successor), who was evenly matched and barely overpowered by Hudson Ahn. He was easily and effortlessly overpowering a post Alexander Sophia training Jay Hong during their fight, but it should also been known that Jay Hong was trying to put a helmet on Jihan's head for his Kali Arnis and only using Systema. While his Hand-Blade style is exceptionally powerful as it almost knocked out Jay Hong, he isn't an idiot and knows that the Hand-Blades can only get him so far, so his true fighting style is a more street like fighting style that involves kicks, punches, knees and elbows. Surprisingly with his scarred up build he has great durability and endurance as he could take every Systema attack used against him by Jay and even overpowered the Systema using Jay Hong and was about to kill him before Jay distracted him and used Kali Arnis. While Jihan did survive the onslaught of attacks used by Jay Hong and could have kept on fighting he accepted his defeat (indicating that he is honorable) and wished his enemy (at that time) luck on the fight ahead.He is still definitely above Jay without weapons as he is shown to overpower Jay in hand to hand combat and is smart enough to take on Hudson and Vin Jin without much difficulty if he uses his battle IQ which ranks him higher. Also keep note that he didn't go all out against Jay which was the same case for Jay but is still debatable.
