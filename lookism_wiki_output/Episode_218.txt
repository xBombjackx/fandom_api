Summary
Zoe
is walking to school when a man asks to buy her spit. She runs away and the man is pursued by Logan, who beats him senseless. At school the fashion boys are shocked to hear the news, and Jace explains olfactophilia and the money it generates. Jace mentions he is looking into it because he is trying to find information about Hostel, now that
Daniel
decided to go against the Big 4 crews.
Jasmine is still lying about her life and Zack is annoyed. Mira tells him the story of the boy who cried wolf and tells him to have faith in Jasmine. Jasmine takes a photo with Mira and uses it to sell spit to strangers. When one asks to see her in person, she takes Mira on a shopping trip and pretends to be her courier. She hands the spit to her client, a juvenile lawyer. They run into Zack, but he walks past them.
Jasmine takes Mira home and laughs about the scam she pulled. The lawyer grabs her face and orders her to take back her spit. Zack approaches them both and reveals he saw everything that happened.
