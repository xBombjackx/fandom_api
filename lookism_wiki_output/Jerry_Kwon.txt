Jerry Kwon (권지태 Kwon Ji Tae)
a member of
Big Deal
, and second-in-command to
Jake Kim
.
Appearance
Jerry Kwon is a extremely tall and muscular young man that looks like a middle-aged man with sunken black eyes and a bald head, he wears a white polo shirt, a pair of black pants and black shoes, he also spots a black letter H-shaped tattoo in his left arm and a grid-shaped scar across its face.
As a child, Jerry used to wear a white shirt with a navy blue tie under a brown sweater.
Personality
Jerry's main character trait is his undying loyalty to Jake. Jerry sees Jake as a brother, becoming known as Jake's sword for this reason. In the Eli Jang arc, he is shown to be honest, honoring Warren's desire to leave the rest of Hostel alone. Other members of Big Deal respect Jerry greatly for his character, but Jake seems to have changed his mind about Jerry at the end of the Juvenile Detention arc, deeming him "too simple".
Fighting Prowess
Jerry's fighting style is to overwhelm his opponents with raw strength. Described as Jake's mighty sword, Jerry's sheer size and strength is so immense that he was able to shrug off attacks from multiple members of the Monstar crew without notice. He also has lots of experience in fighting given his battle against numerous crews. Jerry doesn't seem to back off in a fight regardless of how injured he becomes and also doesn't dodge an attack when he can; this is seen as a weakness by Gun. Jerry is also shown to hold back his full strength whenever he is in a fight near Jake.
After his fight with Gun, he decided to never lose another fight again and learned Boxing as a martial art to help.
Also in the Hunt for Big Deal arc, Jerry was shown to have an 'enraged' mode where he stopped holding back entirely and pushed Mandeok Bang extremely far and to push Mandeok to use moves against Jerry that he didn't use against Tom Lee
