Summary
While on the way there,
Zack
, his lackeys, and
Daniel
all run into
Vasco
and
Jace
. After explaining the situation, Vasco joins them, telling Jace not to come with. He and Zack's lackeys stay behind. Meanwhile, they are being followed by a troublesome trio,
Yui
,
Namsoo
and
Mira
. They all decide to rest at a cafe, and Zack makes a threatening face to some other guys (the lackeys to the thief who beat up Namsoo). Vasco ignores it, and Daniel is uncomfortable.
Zack notices the trio following and goes to greet them. The thug lackeys followed, and threaten Zack, telling him to follow them after noticing the pretty Yui and Mira. Namsoo then sees Woojin coming. Woojin surprises Zack with a punch to the face, then punches him a couple more times before he knows what's going on, much to Yui, Mira and Namsoo's horror.
Mira yells at Woojin and they walk away. Mira wants to report it, but Zack tells her not to. Next, Woojin and his two henchmen (a judo guy and a kicking guy) wait for the meeting with a supposed weakling. Zack, Vasco and Daniel appear; Zack is still bleeding from earlier.
