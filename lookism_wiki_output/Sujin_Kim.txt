Synopsis
She first met
Vin Jin's mother
when she was 7, who doted on her due to her young age, giving her candy and such. She would unfortunately witness one of Cheon Shinmyung's sexual assaults on the woman, who tried to wave it off as them practicing judo.
The next time Shinmyung assaulted the woman, she protested and was murdered for it, a sight the young girl would unfortunately be a witness to as well.
Seven years later, she met Vin Jin by entering his home while he was sleeping, and when he brought the girl to the
Cheonliang Fam
, she would beg for them to take her in by offering her services as a maid. They develop a platonic relationship, which was going into a romantic relationship, before she got kidnapped by
Taejin Cheon
and got murdered by him. Taejin did not know what to do with her so he left her beside an unconscious
Seongji Yook
. Vin Jin found both Seongji Yook and Sujin Kim. He assumed Seongji was the one who harmed Sujin and rushed her to the hospital, to no avail. Seongji, who thought he killed Sujin while in his delirious state, drowned himself out of guilt.
Fighting Prowess
As a civilian raised as a maid for Taejin Cheon, she likely possessed no fighting abilities.
