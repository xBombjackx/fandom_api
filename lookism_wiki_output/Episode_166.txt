Summary
Jiho goes to a cyber caf√© to try and figure out how to stop the scams. He runs into
Doo
and his friends who laugh at Jiho for being in trouble again. Jiho attacks Doo and starts fighting him, and both are stopped by
Zack

Zack interrogates Jiho and finds out he was scammed. He tells
Mira
he is leaving with a friend, and goes to find James. They head to the pool place and he beats up the guys at the table. He confronts James and tells him to give Jiho his account back.
