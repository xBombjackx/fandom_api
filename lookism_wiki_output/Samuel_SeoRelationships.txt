Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel, and gets into his office using the black badge that Gun gave him. He looks around and finds Samuel's brass knuckle, and a board with pictures of the 4 major crews, and weird markings plastered on them.

Samuel seems to be suspicious of Daniel disappearing, and Daniel seems to be suspicious of Samuel's relations towards the 4 crews as well.
Alexander Hwang
Alexander and Samuel are implied to have known each other before Samuel even joined Big Deal.  Alexander would follow and be loyal to Samuel throughout the years. However, implications of the motivation of staying imply that Alexander wanted to use Samuel.
In the early stages of their relationship, Alexander can be seen trying to make himself of a notable identity towards Samuel, yelling out his name at every possible occasion. Later on after Samuel gets rejected by Gun,  Alexander can be seen telling Samuel to "move on" from Gun throughout the years. In the end, fame and money gets to Alexander, and they develop a relationship where Alexander gets abusive and suspicious of Samuel, even once almost running over Samuel with a car.
Later in the manhwa when Tom Lee is seen capturing Alexander, (which is later revealed that he took him to make him work for the third affiliate) Hwang calls out to Samuel asking him to save him. However, Samuel ignores Alexander and leaves telling him, "It's not personal." This implies that Samuel does not care about Alexander.
