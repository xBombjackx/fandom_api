Summary
Goo
is pissed off seeing
Tom
, and he asks if
Charles Choi
was suspicious of him. Choi tells him that he meant to give Goo a bonus for his hard work, and that he didn't mean to upset him. When Goo leaves, Tom tells Charles that he doesn't work for money. Choi grants him a building. Tom Lee calls his men back from the fourth affiliate, and
the president
tries to buy them back.
Manager Kim
tells
Daniel
that they will probably meet again seeing as there are four affiliates in total. Daniel tries to call out to him but he feels his body burning. The president asks
Samuel
to do something about the mess, and Samuel simply smirks at him.
The president starts to cry and remembers the many times he asked Samuel to do something for him. He says that Gun's opinion of him doesn't matter, and Samuel gets triggered. He washes his arms and asks Daniel why
Gun
doesn't approve of him. He fought all the crew heads and none of them could give him an answer. Gun elsewhere reveals that he doesn't approve of Samuel because he is too vicious and confused. Daniel reveals that he stole Samuel's brass knuckles. He starts to feel excited to fight, a feeling that is not coming from him but from his body.
