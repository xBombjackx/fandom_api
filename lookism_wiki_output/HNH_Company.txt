HNH Company (HNH그룹)
is a conglomerate company that owns smaller businesses, with its CEO being Charles Choi, who founded the company in just over 4 years, during the
1st Generation
.
Organization
As a company, HNH owns a number of diverse companies and organizations, such as PTJ Entertainment, as well as having the media on its side.
HNH only became what it is today thanks to the efforts of a group of 10 especially skilled individuals called the "
Ten Geniuses
", it was thanks to these efforts that
Charles Choi
and the HNH Company managed to reach the top in just about 4 years.
Furthermore, at the beginning of the company, Charles already had a short-term partnership with the
Cheonliang's shaman
, which ended after his death, as
his son
did not maintain the partnership. Therefore, the biggest way for the HNH Company to make money at the beginning was certainly through the creation of the
Four Major Crews
, these being four gangs from a specific region of Seoul, who were forced by
Gun Park
and
Goo Kim
to pay 100 million Won every month, to generate funds for the Company, currently, this scheme is no longer in operation.
