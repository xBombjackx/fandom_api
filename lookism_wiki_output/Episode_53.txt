Summary
When he meets him,
Jace
notices another kid getting bullied. A kid they call "Cicada". The senior tells him to bring
Vasco
to school or he will take his place. He then draws on his face. Jace asks the kid about Vasco and hears that no matter how hard he was bullied he never cried or surrendered.
Jace goes to visit Vasco and finds he doesn't look very sick. There are bloody napkins on his dresser and he is scared of Jace's pen. He rips off Vasco's blanket and finds curse words and drawings carved into his chest.
