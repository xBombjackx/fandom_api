Summary
Johan rushes at Zack with speed and Zack dodges, stunning the crowd. Zack reveals he joined the competition so he can confess to Mira when he wins. However, he is beaten badly by Johan, who also decides to humiliate him by offering help after the match. Mira tries to catch up to Johan until she overhears him telling Gun that he has no friends. Hurt by this, she stops chasing him and Johan disappears with Eden.
Later, Mira smiles as Zack practices boxing. She initially disliked Zack because he changed into a bully after losing the boxing match, and he had no goals. Seeing Zack's return towards boxing made her happy again.
