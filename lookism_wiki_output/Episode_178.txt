in a cherry tree field and asks what the problem is. He is mortified to find out Vasco is going on a blind date. He consults the

, and he teaches Vasco how to corner a girl into a wall like a romantic. He ignores this advice but Vasco is awed.
Jace finds
Leonn
surrounded by girls and she asks him if he is going to the fireworks event that night. He tells her about Vasco's date and asks for advice. Vasco tells Leonn he wants to get married someday. Leonn is offended and kicks Vasco, telling him to change his fashion sense. Later, she is seen working out to release her anger towards Vasco. She calls him an idiot for not realizing that he had asked a girl for love advice.
Jace begs
Jay
to help Vasco prepare to the date since he is good at fashion. When Jace and Leonn spy on Vasco's date they are shocked to see she is very pretty. When they see Vasco finally appear they do not recognize him because he looks a lot better than he did before.
