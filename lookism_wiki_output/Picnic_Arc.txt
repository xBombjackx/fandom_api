Episode 139
Daniel

Seonong Ham
, a kid from Potato high, decides to prove he is better than them to win his crush

Jiho
is proud to be a part of Daniel's group because they are popular. He makes mean faces at other kids and hides behind Daniel and Zack. Soomi asks Daniel for his number and he refuses, because he sees
Crystal
alone.
Zack
asks
Mira
to leave with him but
Zoe
