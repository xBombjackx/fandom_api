Summary
Jiho tries to ignore James and his friends but is drawn to them again. He visits them at a pool place they use to hang out. James asks Jiho if he can lend money from him and Jiho offers to make him a bank account. He allows James to make his own password and signs it in his name. Daniel notices that Jiho is not hanging out with him anymore and grows concerned.
As James walks down the road he complains about the amount of money he owes. He notices a sign buying bank accounts. Jiho gets messages from a teenager complaining that he scammed him of a phone purchase he made. The teen confronts him at school and tells him to come outside.
