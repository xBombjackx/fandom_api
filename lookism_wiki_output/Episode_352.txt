Summary
At his private high school,
Eugene
mentions it has been three years since he met with
Charles Choi
and the others to start
the four crews
. He thanks
Mandeok
and
the guy in the cap
for protecting him like
Gun
and
Goo
have protected Choi, and calls them his friends. He is surprised
Zack
hasn't gone down yet, and also by how dirty Zack is fighting. He is doing all kinds of underhanded tactics like headbutting, hitting below the belt, and pivot blows: the tells of dirty boxing. Eugene tells them to stop fighting because Zack passed his test.
Jake
asks
Vasco
if he is really going to do a move that could kill someone, and Vasco tells him that he was the reason Vasco ended up this way.
Jerry
intercepts his elbow blows but injures his hand from the force.
Warren
left the fight with Jerry early because he was disappointed Jerry would not fight with all of his strength. They all stop fighting to watch
Daniel
fighting with the guy in the cap. Daniel's systema is barely keeping up with the other guy's speed. He tries to do a spinning kick but the guy grabs hold of him and pins him to the ground. Eugene tells Daniel he wants to talk to him, and he will tell him about
James Lee
in return.
