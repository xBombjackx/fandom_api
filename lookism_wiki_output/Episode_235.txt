Summary
He claimed when he was younger, he used to have parents, but his father got drunk and would hit his wife. When Eli's mother ran away his father married a new woman who was physically and emotionally abusive towards him. When Eli's father died his wife married a new man who was just as abusive. Eli grew sick of his treatment and ran away from home with Lyon, saying that it was more comfortable on the streets.
Everyone is shocked to hear his story, and Warren asks if Eli has any good memories. Eli mentions a hide and seek game he used to play with his biological mother, and Sally suggests that they play. Eli doesn't want to play but the others race to find hiding spots. Warren opts out of the game, and Eli begins to count.
Max and Derrick are the first to be found. Lyon scratches Max and he yells, causing Eli to find him. Eli then suddenly attacks Max, and when Derrick comes to the rescue he beats up Derrick as well. Sally moves around during the game and finds Max and Derrick on the ground. She freezes and Eli finds her. Right as he is about to punch her he is stopped by Warren, who asks what he is doing. Eli explains that he is it, and Sally realizes that Eli was abused by his first mother as well.
Warren asks Eli why he didn't hit him back, and Eli says he doesn't fight unless he gets something from it. Warren offers Eli anything he wants if Eli wins to fight, and if he loses Eli has to leave Sally's place. Eli stands to fight him.
