Summary
Johan tells Hudson he can have Gangbuk if he wants. He went to a doctor earlier who told him he was losing his eyesight in the same manner as his mother, and he should not exploit them. If he doesn't find treatment, he will go blind permanently.
Jiho asks the prison guard is he's heard of James Lee before, and the guard finds it amusing. He says it doesn't matter since he is going back to prison, and laments that he did not get to go to the funeral of his grandmother. Jiho admits to the prison cop that he lied about his grandmother's death: he got his friends to fake the paperwork. Darius blocks the windshield of the car and leaps off just before the prison guard drives into a truck. Jiho steps out and tells the prison guard he didn't do anything wrong, so he doesn't deserve to go back to prison. Hudson has finished clearing out another karaoke club, one that he finds decent enough to run. The rest of Ansan Public arrive, waiting for James Lee to arrive. Jiho arrives with Darius and Ethan, calling himself James Lee.
Daniel is hanging out in DG's club that he owns. Daniel asks if he can tell him James Lee, and DG tells him that he can only choose to learn about one thing: either the secret of the two bodies, or James Lee.
