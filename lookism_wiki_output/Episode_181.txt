Summary
Jiho is made to do all the tasks in his cell because he is the newbie. He gets the worst conditions but puts up with it because he doesn't want to make things worse for himself. While in prison he spots a plant in his room and takes care of it, telling it to be strong like him. Wally Lee returns from solitary confinement and is placed in Jiho's cell. He is happy to see his plant is watered.
Meanwhile, Darius begins working out, which is illegal in juvie. He tells Jiho to keep guard but he falls asleep, and all the inmates get demerits. The inmates hold him down and prepare to beat him but Wally intervenes with a sawed toothbrush, telling them to back off.
