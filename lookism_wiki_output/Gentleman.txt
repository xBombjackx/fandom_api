Workers

Appearance
Gentleman is a fairly tall man, while he is still a few heads shorter than Gitae Kim. He appears lean and fairly fit. Despite his presumed older age given that he is from the 0th Generation, he looks considerably young. He does give off a "Silver Fox' charm, with his short light blonde hair parted to one side and dark eyes, he compliments his body with a light colored suit and dark colored shoes.
Personality
Gentleman appears to be a formal man with a penchant for being a cognoscente: often seen spraying his cologne on himself whether before or after making a point. He is also mildly laid back or rather indifferent to others, viewing himself as a whole as someone who is "expensive", as well as being someone who does not want to be disappointed.
