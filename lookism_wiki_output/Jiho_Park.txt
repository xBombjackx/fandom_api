“
If you didn't have your body... you would definitely become like me.
”
Jiho Park
(박지호 Park Ji Ho)
was a former student in the fashion department at
J High School
, and the former leader of
Backdoor
and the
James Lee Crew
.
Appearance
Jiho was a bespectacled teen, with a bowl cut, a round baby face, and a warm smile. He was fairly short and lacks muscles. He has dark hair and bangs on his forehead. He normally wore expensive brand clothing or his
J High
uniform.
As a result of his imprisonment, Jiho's hair was shaved but grew back to neck-length 6 months later in an unkempt fringe cut. He no longer wore glasses and lost a few of his teeth. Jiho now lacked fullness in his face, with dark bags under his eyes and a binary expression either showing an eerie grin or no emotion on his face whatsoever.
Personality
Jiho was weak-minded and insecure, easily influenced by others, causing him to often submit to peer pressure. This was especially noticeable whenever he went out with bad crowds, as he was always trying and failing to be “cool” to the point of committing crimes (such as illegal betting, underage drinking, and even almost vandalism). When he was sitting with
Duke
and
Daniel
outside of the convenience store, he started smoking to try to look cooler than them, saying that he had smoked many times; despite it actually being his first. He also bought a lot of expensive brands and limited items for the same reason.
He was power-hungry and obsessed with status, proceeding to take many dangerous actions simply to climb up the social hierarchy. He was friends with Daniel and
Zack
just to enhance his perceived image, and never actually reciprocated any of their friendships and gestures. He only went to them whenever he wanted help. He also looked down on people who he considered lower than him and sometimes even provoked them, but would then run to Daniel and his friends for protection.
Jiho had a habit of victimizing himself and has an inferiority complex. He felt distanced from Daniel's group but never tried to genuinely befriend them in the first place. He was also a very desperate person, going to various lengths to get away with his mistakes and hide his wrongdoings. He lied to the detective that he had actually pushed
James Gong
and Daniel Park.
At Juvenile Prison, he got influenced by
another prisoner
and was in solitary for so long that he became a sociopath. He developed a lust for murder and tried to kill a
cellmate
and his main bully at Juvenile Prison. He ended up getting into fights and making more problems, so much so that the authorities continually shifted him from cells.

Fighting Prowess
Jiho Park in J High was almost always one of the weakest kids in class. His scrawny frame and lack of skill meant he was always on the receiving end of a beatdown. However, after getting into prison and creating his new philosophy Jiho developed a "fighting style" similar to
Eli Jang
and
Dominic Min
. He became far more determined and vicious, getting back up after taking hits from Darius Hong and
Brad Lee
in prison and never faltering for even a second. He also used anything he could grab as a weapon, while also using unfair tactics like biting and sneaking up on them to win. After a couple of months, Jiho became so feared in the prison that he had formed a "crew" of his own and used his underlings to act for him out of fear.
