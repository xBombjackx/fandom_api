Summary
Gun is impressed that Daniel managed to break his arm, and gives him a card with the words "ONE MCN", saying it is a clue to overwhelm the four crews. Meanwhile,
Charles Choi
and
Steve Hong
are out hunting after accepting his offer. Hong asks Choi about gangs of minors he has heard, and he thinks they are being exploited by a businessman. Choi shoots close to Hong, claiming he saw a raccoon. Hong does the same, and calls out
Goo Kim
from behind the tree where he was hiding.
In Gangnam,
Hostel B
are waiting outside the ONE MCN building. The girls are interviewing for an online streaming position at the company, and
Warren
is cleaning the place to appear presentable. They wait near the entrance as
Samuel Seo
and his entourage appear.
