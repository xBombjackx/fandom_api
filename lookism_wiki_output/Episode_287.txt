Summary
A streamer, Jamie, has a bruise on her arm and the viewers quickly point it out to her. The viewers also comment on the lack of sleep she was getting, and the high amount of food she was eating. One streamer tells her to pick up a strawberry if she was kidnapped, and Jamie does so. Some of the viewers are skeptical, while others are concerned for her. Under the table, two grown men glare at her and urge to her behave. The introduction ends.
Amy
and
Natalie
apply to a job at MCN. They get the job quickly after
Samuel
, the CEO, sees that they do not have a background. He introduces them to the five most popular Kwitch streamers, which the two girls find strange.
At school,
Daniel
holds up the One MCN card that
Gun
had given him and observes it, wondering what he should do.
Doo Lee
walks up to him, fascinated. He says that he had been trying to get into streaming. He watched Doo Lee stream, but the viewers are not happy.
At home, Daniel tries it again in his old body, and instantly gets many people to watch him. He shows them what a loser he was in school, and the audience finds it relatable.
The next day, Daniel goes to MCN in his new body while carrying his old body in a suitcase. He has a brief encounter with Samuel, who confirms that he is a member of
Workers.
