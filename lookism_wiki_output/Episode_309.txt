Summary
Gun tells Big Deal that they made the cut, and he expects a 100 million won by the end of the month. The leaders of the gang sit down to discuss their prospects. Old Face proposes using the girls to make a profit, and Jason adamantly opposes it. Jake gets up to leave the meeting, saying they shouldn't make a decision without Sinu present. Samuel also disagrees, saying he will find a way to make the money himself.
When Jake goes to meet Samuel, he is standing by the lighthouse. Jake asks how he plans on making the 100 million won. Samuel tells him to get lost, because he can't stand seeing Gapryong's son. He is jealous of Jake, but he isn't aware of why.
Later, Goo and Gun come to a warehouse to collect their dues. Jake and his crew attempt to stop them, but Goo notices that they have the money needed. Samuel tells Goo that the money is ready to be collected, and kicks it before he can count it. He tells Goo that he has to test him before he can hand him the money. Black Bear gang are upset that Gun and Goo are trying to take down their enemies, and have decided to step in to assert their dominance.
