Summary
Daniel tries to understand why his second body is moving on its own. Samuel and Jake try to attack UI Daniel, but they arenâ€™t doing damage. Jake is ashamed of fighting double, but at the moment all he can think of is survival. Jerry offers to help in spite of his fear. He gathers all his strength into one punch, but Daniel uses the punch to power his own kick. Jake takes the shot and is knocked into a building.
Samuel tells small Daniel to take Vivi and run. He is knocked to the ground by Johan, who picks up Vivi by the hair. Large Daniel notices him and tosses Samuel aside, and Johan tosses Vivi aside.
