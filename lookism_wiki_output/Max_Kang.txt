Fighting Prowess
While not very powerful on their own Max and Derrick were described as Warren to be a 10/10 in terms of fighting capability. Their main strength is their ability to fight as one while supporting others through combo moves. They are so skilled in fact that they defeated Gangdog's, Mighty Warren Chae and were described by Gun as being equal to Johan Seong. It also could be said that they're equal to Hostel A's Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak given Olly's need to create his own Hostel.
Synopsis
History
Max and Derrick grew up in the same orphanage as Warren. Max was abondened in a clothes bin as a baby on a rainy day in a dog cage by his parents, he got his name from the tag that was on the dog cage. He seems to apreciate that his parents gave him a name. Ten years later they met
Warren Chae
as he entered.
The three of them went to the same middle school and gained a reputation for their fighting skills. When Sally Park allowed Warren to stay in her home, they followed him.
The two of them are known for their fighting skills. Gun compared them to Johan Seong in terms of skill. Even Warren could never beat Max and Derrick together, although alone they are not that much. They got matching tattoos in Hostel, unlike the other members, to signify their strong bond.
When Eli Jang left Hostel, Max and Derrick left to earn money to support them. They returned in episode 278, called by Sally Park, to fight Justin Peng and Chuck Kwak, defeating the duo. Ever since, Max and Derrick have remained with Hostel.
