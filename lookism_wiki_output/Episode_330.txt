Summary
Jake
calls
Jerry
and
Lineman
into Hotel Vivi, all three of them disguised with tracksuits.
Mandeok
tells
Eugene
about this and asks if this means they are at war with
Big Deal
now. Eugene says it is not war since there are only three men, but that he wonâ€™t sit back and do nothing.
Jake and the team go to
Old Face
who is tied in the bathroom, and he tells them that the captives are on the top floor. To get there, they will need to take a badge from one of the four executives of the
Workers
third affiliate: Hwang Ho, Taegon Wi, Sowol Jin and Huseong Ha.
Daniel
is captured in a tub when he wakes up. The rich kids are screaming for him to be murdered, and
Vivi
concocts a stronger version of hydrochloric acid to melt him with.
Jake Kim calls
Zack Lee
and tells him that the Workers have Daniel, and Zack calls
Vasco
and
Eli
to Hotel Vivi. Hwang Ho is angry that he lost to Vasco, and is preparing to crush him.
Samuel Seo
gets a call from the Workers allowing him to dispatch to the third affiliate.
Zack arrives on a bicycle and finds the other two waiting for them, but the three of them are blocked by
Johan Seong
. He refuses to move since
Xiaolong
promised to tell him about Pungsan if he does a good job.
