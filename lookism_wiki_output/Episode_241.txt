Summary
Jerry reveals that he was late to arrive because he was on the bus, but he intends to take over Gangdong. Warren insults Jake and Jerry starts to fight him. Gun and Johan analyze their fighting style, with Johan saying he doesn't how Jerry brutally overpowers Warren. Jerry overpowers Warren without backing down from any of his punches. As he goes down, Warren remembers how hurt Sally was when she realized that Eli liked Heather more than he liked her.
Jerry asks Warren why he eased up on the last punch and Warren mentions that he doesn't want Sally to be sad. He makes Jerry promise to leave them alone, and Jerry agrees, stating Big Deal will take over Hostel. This doesn't sit well with Johan, who says he wants to take over Gangdong and defeat Eli Jang. Warren begs Johan to leave Eli alone but he refuses, saying if Warren wants to protect Eli he needs the strength to do so.
Warren in desperation bites Johan's foot, claiming one day he will do the same. Johan decides to step on him but before he can he is attacked by Eli, who bites him in the neck. Johan gets up and asks Eli who he is, and Eli tells him to not touch his family. Warren and Gun are shocked to see the savage look on Eli's face.
