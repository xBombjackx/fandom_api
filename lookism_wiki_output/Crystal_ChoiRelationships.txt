Family
Charles Choi
Charles is her father and he is the only one who knows the fact she has two bodies. He also ordered her to keep an eye on Daniel,  because he knows Daniel has two bodies as well.
As shown, despite caring for her father, Crystal was not blind to his faults and of how selfish and evil he was. This was shown during his funeral, where Crystal acknowledged that even though her father had so many working under him and had met so many people in his life, no one bothered to go to his funeral. A fact that Crystal found both heartbreaking, but fair, as he had hurt, used and abused so many people during his life and earned the justified hatred of many as well.
Friends
Kouji
Kouji and Crystal know each other well because Kouji is one of the ten people who were raised by Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. These ten special children are considered prodigies under his care. Even though the two know each other substantially well, they hardly meet unless Crystal needs Kouji's assistance in an emergency or any similar matter. Their relationship is based on money as he will only do her bidding if he makes a profit off of the work.
DG
DG and Crystal are close acquaintances and know each other quite well because of Crystal's father, the HNH Chairman. His friendship with Crystal surprises many girls since he doesn't show any obvious kindliness to any other girl. Despite being very close to each other, DG and Crystal have no romance in their relationship.
