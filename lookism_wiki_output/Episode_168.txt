Summary
Kouji explains that the email plan didn't work because emails are anonymous. He tells Jiho that most gamers reuse their usernames and finds the culprit's username "Power Gundam" on a gaming website. He finds the culprit's Naver account and begins searching through their social media until he finds a photo of some darts and a convenience store.
Vasco
runs out of the building at this picture.
Kouji uses the location the picture was taken at to find the hangout of the culprit. They call Vasco but he explains he already found the location of the picture. He finds the

at a dart place and tells them to give him Jiho's bank account.
