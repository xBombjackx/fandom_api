Summary
Logan and Vin realize they have no reason to be there anymore, but stay to watch the fight. Johan lunges at Gun and begins remembering pieces of his past.
After Johan's mother was taken to rehabilitation he visited her and learned she needed a cornea surgery. He dropped out of school and began stealing expensive shoes from street thugs and reselling them for money. He was approached by Gun in an alleyway, and Gun offered him a position as a head of a crew. Johan took the job and took over Jin Jang's old crew to earn money for Gun. When Johan collected enough money he went to a doctor but learned that his mother was at the bottom of a waiting list. He begged Gun to move her up the list and Gun gave him the task of uniting the four crews.
During the fight Gun notices how much Johan has improved. He can fast enough to hit Gun, and does so multiple times. He is powerful and very skilled, but it is not enough to beat Gun. Gun states that Johan's only weakness is that he is physically weak, and to prove this he knocks him to the ground with a one punch.
As Johan begins to cry, Gun comments on how sad it is that nobody is willing to help him. He prepares to remove his teeth as punishment but is pushed out the way by Zack. He asks if Johan is okay and Johan stops crying. Gun asks Zack who he is and Zack calls himself Johan's friend.
