Summary
Zack
has not been to school lately, and
Jiho
asks the class president who will run on Sports Day.
Yui
is in the second position, and the president decides that anyone fast enough to dodge
Zack's
punches can run quickly as well.
Daniel
is put as the third runner, and after seeing this,
Jay
volunteers for second. They are missing a girl runner when Zack appears, having been in special training, and is intent on proving to
Mira
that he is better than Daniel.
In a men's soccer game between the Fashion and Practical Music departments, Zack scores a goal from close up. Fashion's costume is a honeybee while Practical Music is dressed as animals. As Daniel gets the ball, Zack thinks that Daniel cannot do any better than what he did, getting past ten guys. Then, Zack thinks of his experiences seeing his bullies kick a ball, and scores a long-distance shot.
In tug of war, Music vs Vocal and Dance, Practical Music prevails. The next is Fashion vs. Architecture, the latter dressed as riding dinosaurs, and
Vasco
challenges Daniel to a one-on-one tug of war contest.
