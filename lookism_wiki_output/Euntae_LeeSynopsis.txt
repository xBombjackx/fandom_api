Zack and the Ghost Lady
Mira
and
Zack
bump into Jace and Euntae at school in the evening when Mira goes to retrieve her forgotten cell phone. Euntae clings to Jace's back, shivering in fear. It turns out that Euntae and Jace are there because Euntae wants the
Ghost Lady
to grant him a wish so that people will stop saying he's stupid. Zack, trying to act cool despite his obvious fear, laughs at Euntae's superstitious ideas, making fun of Euntae, saying that ghosts don't actually exist. Jace tells him that, if he isn't afraid, he should go and sign his name on the glass frame around the portrait.
At the classroom,
Jace is
incredulous that
Zack
had actually signed his name on the portrait. He wants to go check it out immediately with Euntae, but, Euntae, frightened, tells him to go tomorrow instead.
The next morning, Euntae,
Jace
,
Zack
,
Mira
, and
Daniel
go to the storage room to see the signature. When they get there, they realize that Zack's signature isn't on the glass frame outside the portrait, but on the windowpane, and Euntae is seen shocked as Zack faints and wets his pants.
