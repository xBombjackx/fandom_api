Summary
Jin Jang has a flashback where he learns James plans to betray Olly because he is annoyed by him. Olly was aware of this betrayal by both of them, and asks Jin Jang to grant him one last favor: to see Eli Jang one last time.
Hostel girl then betrays Jace and reveals she is Jin Jang's girlfriend, wearing a wig. Jin Jang sent Jerry Kwon away so he wouldn't learn he is reviving his old crew called K House. Back at Sally's house, Eli confront Olly to fight him.
