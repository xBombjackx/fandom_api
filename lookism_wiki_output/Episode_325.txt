Summary
Daniel has lost a lot of weight since training with
Sophia
and he is starting to see positive results. As he is stepping out of the house he smells soap in the air, and a girl his age passes by.
Doo Lee and Alexander Hwang are getting yelled at for talking too much while working. Doo was taken from the fourth affiliate to work in the third affiliate's cleanup crew. Alexander was sent to the third affiliate to do odd jobs after being taken by
Tom Lee
. Daniel runs into them crying on the road and decides to buy them some fried chicken. He is reminded of
Like What
and
Hilarious
and sees one of the waitresses being harassed by her boss. Daniel intercepts the boss as he tries to grab the girl, and the boss moves away. He tells the girl she should try making money in other avenues, and that he knows a guy (himself) who made it large using TikTacTok.
Johan and Jake are playing word association when they come across Daniel, who is surprised that the heads of crews are working as bouncers. Daniel hands Jake his ID, which says he is 90 years old. Jake tells Daniel minors aren't allowed inside, and Daniel reveals his black VVIP badge.
