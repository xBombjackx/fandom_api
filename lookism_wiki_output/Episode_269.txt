Summary
Daniel realizes that Zack will not decide to let him through. He decides Zack is being unreasonable and tries to sucker punch him like before, but Zack stays in place.
Vin asks Vasco if he resents him for bullying Duke. He tells Vasco that Duke deserved to be bullied because he is poor, fat and ugly, and Vasco lunges at him. He throws Vasco onto the ground and traps him in an armbar. Vin reveals to Vasco that the reason he quit wrestling is because he was a sadistic kid who liked breaking people's bones.
Vasco overpowers Vin and sends him flying with one punch. He has learned how to fight from his time in the bear family, and has taken the mother bear to be his second master.
