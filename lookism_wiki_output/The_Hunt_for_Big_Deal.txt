Synopsis
Episode 411
The episode starts at Big Deal Street where
Jake
is resting on a desk.
Jerry
approaches Jake with a report of everything
Lua
could find about the pre-generation and the first generation. The information revealed the status of many members of the pre-generation and it was revealed that Jerry's father Baekho Kwon died on the same day as
Gapryong Kim
. Lua makes her way into the room so; Jerry and Jake consider making an excuse to leave. But Lua reveals that the
Workers
are plotting something.
Samuel is on call with
Eugene
who is surrounded by
Mandeok

mysterious capped man
after his fight with
Eli

Seokdu Wang
. Samuel tells Eugene that Eli has taken down the King of Pyeongtaek. Eugene tells Samuel that he can skip Workers meeting for the day.
Ryuhei
,
Kenta
and
Kazuma
are early to the meeting. Ryuhei is impatient that Eugene isn't present, but Kenta responds that they're here early. Eugene greets the three of them and reveals that he has also summoned
Xiaolong
, who has returned from China to the meeting. Ryuhei approaches Xiaolong and starts insulting him only for Xiaolong to hit him causing Ryuhei to fall back. Eugene tells the two to cut it out. While Ryuhei apologizes, he sticks a sticky note that reads "dumbass" on Xiaolong's back. Eugene then reveals that the Workers will hunt for
Big Deal
and everyone is free to kill any members.
The episode goes back to Jake and Lua's conversation. Lua says that they need to come up with a plan to stop the Workers now that they've taken down Hostel and Big Deal is most likely next.

Episode 412
Eugene is playing a game of tennis with Mandeok and asks if Mandeok really wants to fight Big Deal especially since Mandeok hates fighting. But Mandeok still agrees.
Ryuhei is in front of
Mitsuki's
door and tells her that the Workers are planning to go after Big Deal and that the Second Affiliate has no choice but to join. Ryuhei tells Mitsuki that they will have to fight

third affiliate arc
and leaves.
The Big Deal members meet again, and Lua explains to them how after gathering information, there's nothing they can do to stop the Workers from going after Big Deal. Lua explains that it's going to be a struggle considering the Workers' numbers and how many powerful fighters they have on their side.
Jason
asks Jake if they should call
Sinu
, but it is revealed that Sinu and
Yeonhui
already left the street together, entrusting the street to Jake. Jake refuses telling them that Sinu has found happiness and that they need to leave him be. Jake leaves again to meet with someone he's been unable to meet.
Lower Big Deal members are discussing the news about Hostel being taken down and wondering if Big Deal is next. Jerry approaches them letting them know that if they're scared, they can run.
Brad
and Jason are staring across the ocean discussing the events. Jason asks Brad what he'll do if Big Deal disbands, but the two decide that they can't give up and that they need to show the Workers what they're made of.
Samuel and Eugene are then walking together in a parking garage. Eugene is surprised that Samuel was willing to take part in the hunt for Big Deal, but Samuel says he hasn't had a change of heart. Samuel has been gifted Eugene a car and Samuel is thankful.
Jake is then meeting with the person he's been unable to meet, and it is revealed that it is
