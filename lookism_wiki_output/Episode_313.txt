Summary
Sinu folds and reveals that there isn't a way to beat Gun; he and Jake should just surrender. Jake is livid and tells Sinu to give him the secret, but he tells him to wait. Gun has given him a card to contact the Workers, saying that if he cannot deal with the crew, it is best he sell it. He tells his plan to Old Face, and he asks the members of Big Deal to join him. Most of them do, but Jason and a few others refuse to leave Big Deal. He calls Jerry and tells him to take care of Gangdong, so he isn't present for the selling of Big Deal. Yeonhui overhears him and realizes that Sinu doesn't plan on selling Big Deal, but selling himself. Old Face and his crew decide to take down Jake on the orders of Sinu. He and the YB crew defeat them, and Jake hurries to stop Sinu from selling the crew.
