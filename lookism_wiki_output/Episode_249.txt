Jerry Kwon's Performance Test (continued)
Jerry
contemplates whether or not to kill Lineman, and decides to follow
Jake's
advice and not kill his classmates. Elsewhere, Lineman is lying again when he is confronted by
Big Deal's
executives, asking for Jerry Kwon. He points out his classmate is shocked to find out Jerry is No.2 of Big Deal.
Jake comes to Jerry's school to bring him lunch and hears about Lineman's lies. Instead of getting annoyed he is pleased to find out Lineman sees him as a brother. He forgives Lineman and praises him for his loyalty, and Lineman decides to follow Jake forever. Jerry's teacher is happy to see the Monster band disbanded thanks to Jerry's influence. She decides he isn't a bad kid after all.
Prologue
In present time,
Olly Wang
and
Jin Jang
discover
Eli Jang
is on good terms with Hostel B again. They form an alliance and Olly remembers how weak he used to be. Before he could kill
Lyon
he was stopped by Jerry, who saved the cat. He was later attacked in an alleyway by
Darius
, who sexually assaulted him. He returned to
Gun
who decided to train him. Olly reveals that he created his own
Hostel
to mimic Eli's hostel, and hopes that Eli will return one day so he can show him how powerful he has become.
Daniel is back in school but has made a mistake: he came in his original body. He lies that he is covering classes for his roommate, and is nervous he will be found out. The students of
J high
have changed their look and are all headed to the fashion department for different reasons.
