Summary
Xiaolong recalls when he sent Taegon Wi to monitor Jake Kim, going under the alias Yejin Kim. Taegon sais Jake was a playboy and an undignified guard, but a hard working and easygoing person as well. He is shocked to see how powerful Jake was. Gun hears people comparing him to Xiaolong and says he would have to fight him in order to see how strong he truly is.
Jake tells Xiaolong that he’s going to take Vivi to get information about the Workers No.8, Sinu Han. Jake runs towards Vivi’s room and Xiaolong races after him. Jake throws the spear at Xiaolong, and when he’s dodging he grabs his head and slams him into the ground. With Xialong incapacitated, he walks to Vivi’s door.
Xiaolong recalls being promoted to Cheon No.1 by the current master Jiou Jeon. He is taught Cheon Hohuigong, a martial art that is passed down to the Cheon guards. It’s about making the body into a weapon. Xiaolong declines the offer to protect the chairman because he wants to protect Vivi. Gun continues his narration by saying he would have had to fight Xiaolong because he doesn’t know how he would fare against his martial art. In present day Xiaolong rises again to fight.
Johan beats all the guards with Sowol, and she cowers on the floor. Samuel offers Johan space under his umbrella, and Johan asks where Vivi is.
