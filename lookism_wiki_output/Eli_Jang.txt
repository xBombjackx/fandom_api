He has a tall stature and slender body frame, with pale skin and dark-colored eyes. On his back there are multiple scars including even a bullet wound he got while living on the streets. He used to wear rugged clothing when he was younger, but now he typically wears brand clothing or his school uniform.
Up until he was 15, he had long straight black hair. During the
Eli Jang Arc
, Heather had given him a haircut, where the sides of his head were shaved. Throughout the majority of the series, he is seen with his hair dyed blue with pink and lavender highlights, but as of the
Workers(3 Affiliates) Arc
, he is revealed to have changed it to a bleached blond mullet.

Now as the President of Workers 5th Affiliation, Eli dyed his hair back to black.
He has a letter-shaped scar on the left side of his forehead from his fight with
Darius Hong

that he covered with henna and later on with an "H" tattoo to commemorate his time with his friends and the creation of Hostel.
Personality
Eli Jang seems to be rather kind. He doesn't judge by appearance, seeing how he has a crush on Crystal's short body. This is possibly due to Crystal being similar to his dead lover, Heather. who is the mother of his daughter, Yenna. He also has a lot of self-confidence despite his terrible hair-cutting skills. He dreams to be a hairdresser when asked by Vasco what his dream is, this most likely have been influenced by
Heather
.
Eli Jang single-handedly defeats several members of the God Dogs.
He usually tries to avoid conflict, especially in front of Yenna; he did not protest even when some of the
God Dogs
treated him harshly, rather he apologized, seeking to end the argument peacefully.
He is very protective of his daughter Yenna and considers her as the greatest gift he ever received. He shows surprising strength when it comes to her, such as when he single-handedly beat over a dozen members of the God Dog Crew.
In his past, Eli proved to be a very violent man as he grew up on the streets. He was willing to do just about anything to get what he wants. While he did display a very simple vocabulary he also showed to be very street smart given that he was able to come up with the idea of Hostel in the first place. However, despite his attitude, Eli only desired a family that cared for him and he is willing to do just about anything to protect and provide for them, as evidenced by him picking a fight with Gun to go see his daughter Yenna and him attacking
Johan Seong
for harming his allies.
Fighting Prowess
“
I'm not fighting Eli ever again. Because it felt like I'm fighting a beast.
”
— Warren Chae about Eli Jang's fighting style
Street Fighting and Savagery
Eli Jang is one of the most savage and aggressive fighters shown. His upbringing on the streets with
Mister Carpenter
coupled with his lack of formal martial arts training cultured fighting instincts often called "animalistic". He was so fearsome that Gun took him as his protégé, comparing his fighting style to his partner Goo's. Eli's fighting style can be surmised as pure efficient savagery, utilizing any-and-all attacks to finish the fight as succinctly as possible. This includes biting, groin grabbing, eye-gouging, headbutting, fiercely stomping a grounded opponent and using any weapon he can get his hands on. Interestingly, it is noted that his fighting style is a mirror copy of Tom Lee's by employees of the White Tiger Centre. His savage fighting style gets more dangerous when Eli is cornered. He uses his opponent's clothes or accessories to restrain or to inflict great damage on them as seen when he used Warren's clothing as makeshift handcuffs

and when he strangled Darius with his necklace.

After meeting Eli once again, Tom Lee remarked that he isn't as strong as he expected him to be and resolved to teach him everything again from scratch in order to awaken the real beast inside him. After a month of training and getting beaten up, Tom told Eli that he awakened something called the Animal Instinct, only then Tom acknowledges Eli and gives Yenna back to him.

Physical Endurance
Eli has great endurance as he was able to spring back up after being hit by powerful fighters like Warren Chae and Darius Hong. He is also quite powerful as he once knocked out Johan Seong in one swing of a flute and it is implied that after training with Gun he got much stronger giving Gun the scar on his chest when the latter decided to test him. He is strong enough to defeat
Ivan Park
and
Hope Park
, two fighters renowned for their physical strength, with ease.

Aikido and Weapon Use
Thanks to Gun's training, Eli now knows Aikido as a martial art and seems to have proficiency in the usage of stun batons. Gun remarked that he gave Eli a stun baton because he is too strong, metaphorically referring to that weapon as a chain to restrain Eli. His fighting method is proven to be efficient and effective as Eli could defeat singlehandedly Hostel A's mobs and Darius for the second time.
Hunt for Big Deal arc
In the hunt for Big Deal arc Eli became incredibly more powerful than before so much so that some underlings in Big Deal stated that Eli was overflowing with power and that
Mandeok
said that he has finally became a strong man and made up for the 3 year hiatus. This is proven even further with the fact that by this time he has played a crucial role in defeating two 1st Gen kings and taking over their territory. His endurance is so great that during the fight against
Sinu Han
even though he was bloody and beaten he still didn't fall to the ground until
Gun
finished the job.
