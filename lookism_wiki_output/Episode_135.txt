Summary
They worked together untying the person on the cross and it was later revealed he was a reporter that wanted to write an article about the illicit dog cult. Zack goes back to save Mira and Johan is impressed by his fighting skill. The reporter tells them to meet him when they save their friend, but instead they go to the priest to warn him about the cult. The reporter is shocked to see they brought the priest, because he is the leader of the cult.
The priest seized this opportunity as soon as they were about to escape by grabbing Mira, then calling out his guard dogs leaving Zack and Johan greatly outnumbered. The reporter ran away from the scene leaving the three back into the camp. Johan and his friends were all locked inside dog cages forced to watch the sacrifice while the priest. Johan's mother (with her poor eyesight) regained her sanity after seeing Johan in the cage with her poor vision. The priest caught Johan's mother after she unlocked the cage commanding his disciples to use her as sacrifice for the dog gods.
