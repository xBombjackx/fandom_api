Summary
Johan is surprised to see Vasco won't fight back against him. Vasco explains that he is only fighting to protect his friends, because power exists to protect others. Johan is triggered at this response and beats him viciously, but Vasco doesn't budge. He is angry that he cannot win against Vasco and decides to leave. Jin begins beating Vasco to keep him quiet and doesn't stop until Johan glares at him. Johan confirms that people only listen to power, and walks away fuming.
Jin buys gas and orders Vasco to drink it, using the other Burn Knuckles as hostages. Vasco looks to his peers then opens his mouth, but is stopped by Leonn Lee. Leonn brings the first year Burn Knuckles and shouts that they are not worthy if they cannot protect Vasco. Vasco is moved and realizes he doesn't have to fight on his own. He tells the Burn Knuckles they can begin fighting back, and Jace assembles the sophomores to beat the God Dogs.
