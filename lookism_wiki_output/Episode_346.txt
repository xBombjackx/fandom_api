Summary
Samuel takes Jake to the basement, where there is a lit room with a stage and multiple bleachers. Sinu used to fight here in the Workers’ underground fighting ring. He and other prisoners were treated like animals and had to fight year long under grueling conditions. Samuel used to talk to Sinu during his breaks, but Sinu only remembered Jake and how he would save him. Samuel wondered if it was a side effect of the drugs he was taking. He would give him a pen to write with so he could have some amount of freedom, and Sinu would write on the walls. He filled the walls and the floor with the names of the Big Deal members so he wouldn't forget. Jake demands Samuel tell him where SInu is captured. He tells Jake that Sinu was moved to a bigger stadium, and that he brought him to this room to have a private place to speak. Samuel also says he will help him find Sinu if Jake helps him become king.
Daniel returns home and is upset that he didn’t do much, but happy that everyone is safe. He managed to steal some of Vivi’s cookies, so he plans on giving it to Steve Hong. He bumps into DG and drops the cookie, which the latter picks up and says he will be confiscating.
