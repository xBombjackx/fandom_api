Summary
Zoe goes to the park and finds Daniel with Logan. She texts him angrily about the incident and Logan tells Daniel to message her on his behalf. He buys alcohol and tells Daniel to meet Zoe at the rodeo. Daniel meets Zoe and tells her where to go.
Logan is waiting for Zoe at the rodeo with a bouquet of roses. He runs into the God Dogs, who are angry at him for beating them earlier. Zoe goes to visit Daniel's comatose body and sees he left her a letter.
Daniel explains that he used to be bullied by Logan. He ran away to avoid seeing him but is now being bullied again. He apologizes for leaving her and tells her to stay away from him. Zoe cries at the letter and Daniel boards a bus to go back to his mother's house.
