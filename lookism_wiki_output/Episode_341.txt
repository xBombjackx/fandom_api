Summary
Daniel gets to the penthouse and releases the tied up influencers. They tell him there’s one more guy locked in another room, and he goes to investigate.
Xiaolong tells Samuel he will do whatever he wants if he protects Vivi. Samuel says he doesn’t want to. He was ordered by Eugene to help him break up the third affiliate’s current leadership, since they’re causing trouble. He wanted to make use of Vivi’s relationship with her father, but the leader of T Company refused to do business with them. If Samuel can bring Vivi to Eugene, he will be able to run the third affiliate.
Samuel mocks Xiaolong and tells Jake they are allies now. Jake asks what he is going to do with Vivi, because he needs her to tell him where Sinu is. Samuel says he will tell him about Sinu later but Jake doesn’t trust him, and they start fighting. As they are fighting, Daniel is thrown out between them. He warns them to run. The lights start flickering and influencers run away screaming. Daniel’s second body appears in ultra instinct form.
