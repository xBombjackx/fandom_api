Summary
The guy ignores Daniel and walks to Hudson, saying he did well and it's okay he lost. He ignores Daniel a second time and says he isn't interested in the second generation, but he came for James Lee. Daniel asks if the guy is willing to lose again, and he gets irritated.
Tom Lee narrates that there were many powerful leaders of the first generation, one of them being Taesoo Ma, king of Ansan who Daniel is currently fighting. Taesoo has the trademark of only fighting with his right fist. He is very powerful, damaging Daniel's arm and stopping his reverse kick.
Taesoo recalls his past when he fought with James Lee and lost. James acknowledged Taesoo but said it was time for the first generation of fighters to end. Since Taesoo would never stop fighting, he decided to cut his finger off. Taesoo pleaded with him to take his right eye instead. Since then, Taesoo has wanted revenge against DG, and to do the same to him.
Daniel gets back up and says he will show Taesoo how powerful the second generation can be. Vasco uses Brekdak's skill No.5 on Taesoo, and Zack punches him with chains in his hands. Taesoo is pleased with them all and tells them to come at him. Then DG comes flying from the building to kick Taesoo. He tells Daniel to go inside since there is someone waiting for him.
