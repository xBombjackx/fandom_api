Summary
Goo beats all of the bullies easily and sadistically. Everyone is brought to the principal's office where they decide to drop the matter to avoid police investigation. Vasco asks Goo how he can become stronger and he tells him a ridiculous workout of 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats and a 10 km run every day.
Jace decided to get tattoos to encourage Vasco to cover his. He was still afraid of needles, but less so. He finishes telling the story to Daniel, who is touched. They overhear some bikers in the area and Jace recognizes his old bullies.
