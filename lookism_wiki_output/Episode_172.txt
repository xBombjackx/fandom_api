Summary
As
Daniel
falls to the ground he has flashbacks to his memories in his second body. He wakes up in a cold sweat and races to find himself. As the ambulance takes him away he struggles to catch it but is not fast enough. He tries to smash his head in to wake up but only knocks himself out in the snow.
Jiho
is interrogated by the police and begins to panic. The detective mentions that if Daniel and
James
do not wake up he will have to wait for answers. Jiho begins to hope that Daniel and James don't wake up, and the detective notices the bruises on his face.
At the convenience store,
