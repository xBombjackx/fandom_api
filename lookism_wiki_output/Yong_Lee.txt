Yong Lee is a minor character in Lookism. He is a senior at Gian High School and the ex-boyfriend of
Yui Kim
.
Appearance
Yong Lee has a slim but muscular build. His skin is light beige and covered in tattoos from his right pectoral to his right elbow. His hair is the colour of terracotta and brushed back away from his face, which is partially obscured by a pair of large shades. According to
Zack Lee
, Yong "looks like a gangster"

.
Personality
Yong is cocky and self-assured, convinced of his own greatness and presumptuous enough to vocalize it. He blusters and boasts without presenting any evidence to validate his allegations, in one instance claiming that "men don't feel cold,"

despite having goosebumps obvious enough for others to notice. His insistence that the goosebumps are actually a result of his atopy demonstrates that when his word is called into question, he resorts to lying.
So too does he resort to violence. Yong's egotism is accompanied by a foul temper and a predilection towards excessive brutality. He has a volatile nature, being quick to anger and quick to react to the emotion with behavior that the average person would consider extreme. He attempts to strike
Daniel Park
for his unresponsiveness, assaults
Yui Kim
upon learning that the gifts she'd given him were originally meant for Daniel, and starts a fight with
Zack Lee
after the boy criticized him for his abuse of Yui.
