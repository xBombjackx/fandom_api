Summary
Gun is asked how strong Eli is compared to the others. He says Eli could have been strong if he continued fighting, but he took a three year break. Without doing any training in that time, the others would have surely surpassed him. However, Eli has been doing some training. When Tom Lee found out Eli had a daughter, he kidnapped her. He kept her away from Eli until Eli regained his animal instincts: namely, being sneaky with stronger opponents. In one month he managed to win back Yenna from Tom.
Johan throws Eli’s coat in his face and Eli bats it away. He notices Yenna’s toy in the air and grabs it, but Johan kicks him into the wall and knocks him out. Johan is surprised Eli left himself open for attack just to get this toy, and he takes his badge.
Jerry and Lineman wake up and are shocked to see Jake scarred from his fight. Jake tells Xiaolong he didn’t want to get serious, because he was losing his mind thinking about revenge. He’s willing to drop the facade for Xiaolong and pretend that he is Gun.
