Summary
Jin Jang tells Vasco to give up and join the God Dogs while he still can. He is worried Johan will find out about the bank account incident, so he tells Vasco to keep it a secret. Vasco ignores Jin and starts fighting him. Jin finds himself severely outmatched by Vasco, who is not only strong but well trained. As Vasco knocks Jin out he tells him the
Burn Knuckles
will never be swallowed by anyone, because they have their own agenda.
Daniel's friends race to the dart place to see Vasco has already handled the situation. They take Jiho's account and return all the money to their owners. Vasco is cheered on by the Burn Knuckles for his bravery and Daniel notices Jiho stopped coming to school.
The 4 crews hear about the incident and become interested in Vasco. Johan visits Jin in the hospital and is told that Vasco beat Jin for trying to recruit him. He is disappointed because Vasco knows Daniel, and he considered Daniel a friend. He tells the God Dogs to prepare for a gang war with J high.
