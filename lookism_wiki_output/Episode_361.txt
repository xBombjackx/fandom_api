Summary

short temper, saying they get messed with a lot as runaways.

decides to take Daniel for an interview, and Daniel tells Eli to stay behind and cool down a bit.
Zack
beats up all the gangsters to
Jace's
surprise. They interrogate one of the bar workers and he says they don't know about the James Lee crew, only that high schoolers have been taking over bars.
Channing
enters and is surprised they beat everyone, and he asks if they want to work with them. Zack punches him and discovers Channing is a kickboxer. Channing says he will only use one hand to fight, and Zack thinks he is going to use his feet when his guard is down. Channing however uses a tattoo gun to slash Zack across the chest. Zack loses to Channing, and Jace tries to attack him but he is knocked to the ground as well.
Jacky takes Daniel to the crew's base for an interview. He knocks on the door and gets no response. When he enters,

Eli decides to go to the base anyway, and
DG
rolls up to tell him not to. Eli refuses, and DG asks if he wants to get in trouble.
