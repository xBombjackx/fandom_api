“
A man who's all power and no control... won't be very popular with the ladies.
”
— Beolgu Lee,
Ep. 453
Beolgu Lee
is a secondary character, a member of Team Shin Sera in the White Tiger Job Center
Appearance
In his youth, Beolgu was a tall and muscular man with salt-and-pepper hair styled into a messy quiff.
Currently, he is a shorter man with a pot belly, a case of crown balding, and a perpetual smile on his face.
Personality
He acts quite flirtatiously, speaking to
Hudson Ahn
about what makes a man popular with ladies.
He has stated that in his youth, he was like Hudson, but had nobody to set him on the right path.
He's also very tricky and prefers to use psychological manipulation when he can.
Relationships
Tom Lee
Both seem to know each other well, with Beolgu being part of Tom's organization, in addition to having already fought together in the Gapryong Fist.
Synopsis
Workers (1st Affiliate)
Beolgu appears with Team Sera Shin to defeat the Allied members in the
1st Affiliate
; Beolgu stays behind to defeat Hudson Ahn. Despite trying to make Hudson doubt his path by lying to him, his words end up having the opposite effect, making Hudson strong enough to beat Beolgu.
Fighting Prowess
Beolgu Lee is considerably strong, taking into account that he is a member of the 0th Generation, in addition to claiming to have beaten
Taesoo Ma
in his prime before he lost to
James Lee
and lost his eye. However, due to his seeming surprise when he experiences Taesoo's fighting style in episode 454, when combined with his personality, it is likely this is a lie.
Having previously been a street vendor, he is beyond skilled in lying. He does background research on his opponent before their fight and makes up lies to make his opponent lose their will to fight. He then toys with and crushes his psychologically weakened opponent.
This strategy does not work well against those of strong moral principles however, as evidenced by his defeat in his prime at the hands of Gapryong Kim and, in the modern day, at the hands of Hudson Ahn.
