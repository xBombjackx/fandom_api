Synopsis
James Lee (Arc)
When Ansan Public came to Seoul, they wanted to meet James Lee. Jiho Park pretended to be James Lee so he could hold a meeting with them. He proposed an alliance with Ansan where they would be able to use James Lee's name in order to maintain status and power, while Jiho would provide them assistance in running their legal and illegal businesses. Jiho Park offered to use his Backdoor members as forces for Ansan, while Ansan agreed to setting up business to create profit for Backdoor.
One Night III
When DG heard about the James Lee Crew using his name, he set off to prevent them from doing so. Daniel Park and his friends also went to attack the crew since they heard they were causing trouble. Hudson Ahn was defeated by Daniel Park, Channing Choi was defeated by Vasco, and Jacky Lee was defeated by Zack Lee. Their leader Taesoo Ma was also defeated by DG. Daniel then confronted Jiho Park at the convenience store and the two of them fought each other. Following the defeat of all of their members and the death of Jiho Park, the James Lee Crew was disbanded.
