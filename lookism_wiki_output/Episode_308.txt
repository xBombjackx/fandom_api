Summary
Goo attempts to introduce himself, but Sinu hits him and tells the others to get back, because he is much stronger than him. Goo begins fighting Sinu, but Sinu's punches are actually doing damage. Big Deal are surprised to see Sinu fighting this hard. Sinu heard from other gangs that they have been defeated by Goo as a test, and his friend Jagalchi told him that he needs to be prepared for this. Sinu tries his best, and Gun feels as though he might be able to beat Goo. Goo takes the chopsticks Sinu was eating with and sharpens them into a weapon, which he begins slashing him with. As Sinu is being beaten, Goo tries to stab him, but Jake catches his hand with the chopsticks. Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.
