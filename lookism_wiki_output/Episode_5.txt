Summary
Daniel
gets a job at a local convenience store selling cigarettes. While he finds that in his new body, the owner is very willing to hire him, the owner is more reluctant when it comes to his old body. In fact, the owner almost doesn't hire him, until Daniel shows that he has a very adept knowledge of cigar brands, due to his days as a 'cigarette servant.' Though, the salary is still lower in his old body.
During his shift, he comes across
Zack
and his friends who are trying to buy some cigarettes. He refuses them and gets beaten, and
one of them
take a nude picture of him to blackmail him. When his mother calls him again he tells her his life is going well, but doesn't mention the incident. When Daniel returns to school he finds that the guys are making fun of his picture to the other classmates.
