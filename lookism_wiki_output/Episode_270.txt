Summary
Vasco tells Vin to apologize and he will stop, but Vin refuses. Vasco brings out the red mongkol and the two begin fighting to the death.
Ivan Park
is watching in horror and notifies Jin Jang, who sets out to leave with Olly Wang.
Logan decides to run over Jay, but he kicks him off the bike. It swerves and explodes, causing Logan to get pissed off. Elsewhere,
Goo Kim
and
Gun
discuss Logan Lee, and Goo remarks that Logan's muscular build is the reason he wants him as a successor.
Jay is at a disadvantage but he does his best using Systema, a fighting technique he learned from his teacher as a child. He manages to hurt Logan enough to force him into choking Jay. Jay is about to tap out when Logan remarks he will hurt Daniel the same way. He feints like he is knocked out and grabs a red-hot exhaust pipe from his broken bike and holds it to Logan's back.
Logan releases Jay out of the pain. He is shocked to see Jay's hands are bleeding from the heat of his weapons. Elsewhere, Warren is in shock at how good Eli's fighting skills have become under Gun's training.
