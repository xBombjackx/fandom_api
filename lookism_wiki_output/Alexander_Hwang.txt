Alexander Hwang used to be Samuel's lackey. He followed him on his way out of Big Deal and stuck with him through the downfall of his crew. When Alex made a killing off of bitcoin he bought the fourth affiliate of Workers and invited Samuel to be his director. Through the years however he became very ungrateful and condescending towards Samuel.
Hwang would often disguised himself as Mr. Gold, one of the five largest Kwitch streamers. He used this identity to spy on the streamers and their activities. Once he caught Daniel, he exposed this identity to him.
