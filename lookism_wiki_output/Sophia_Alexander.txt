—Sophia Alexander  in
episode 318
Sophia Alexander
(Александра Софья)
is a minor character appearing in
Lookism
,
Manager Kim
, and
Dead Mansion
. She is a member of H Group, serving as
Steve Hong
's bodyguard, and also acts as a trainer to
Daniel Park
and
Jay Hong
.
Appearance
Sophia is a tall and exceptionally well muscled woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. She has a very defined face with strong features, and typically wears her hair loose.
Personality
Sophia comes off as a stoic, expressionless woman with a no-nonsense, all-serious attitude. She shows clear intolerance for certain phrases, such as "brought in" or "broke in." Beneath her seemingly emotionless exterior, however, lies a passionate, dedicated, and dutiful person, driven by a strong sense of honor and responsibility. She also has a mildly comical dense streak, as shown when she misinterpreted her employer's words due to a language barrier.
Relationship
Alexander Alyssa
- It's mentioned that she's related to Sophia by blood, so she might be her daughter. However, given the sense of distance and the fact that they’re seeing each other after a long time, it’s more likely that they’re relatives rather than immediate family.
Alexander Valentina
- She is related by blood, but upon hearing of the atrocities she committed, she became furious and declared that she would personally punish her.
Synopsis
Sophia Alexander accompanied Steve Hong to
Daniel Park
's home. She knocked him out, and stood by Steve as he negotiated for Daniel Park to work for him. Once Daniel agreed to help fight against the Workers, she trained him to lose weight.
She is also responsible for
Jay
's training in Systema and Kali/Arnis.
Fighting Prowess
She stands well over 2 meters tall, with a massive build and monstrous strength—ripping off a front door like it’s nothing and slamming people into the ground with ease. As the one who taught
Jay Hong
Systema and given her special forces background, her weapons skills are also top-notch. In a sparring scene with
Daniel Park
, she fought using a knife, making it likely that she was the one who taught Jae the Filipino martial art of Kali/Arnis.
She once knocked out the sturdy, durable Daniel with a single knee strike. Even Daniel—who had greatly grown after fighting against
Gun Park
,
Senior Manager Kim
, and
Tom Lee
—was so overwhelmed by her power that he lost all will to fight and could only watch as his body was dragged away in fear.
Although she’s not heavily featured in the story, Daniel’s flashbacks portray her as a cold and ruthless trainer. At one point, she attacked him with a knife using her thick arms—treating the training as if it were a live combat situation. This reflects the mindset of someone with a special forces background, where a single moment of carelessness can mean life or death.
The Systema used by Daniel is revealed to be the Alexander Systema, developed by Sophia herself. Considering that only a few characters in the Park Taejun Universe have created their own unique martial arts, Sophia's presence stands out all the more.

Trivia
Daniel Park
calls her by the nickname “Sophie”, implying that they grew emotionally close through harsh training. Likewise, there are depictions suggesting that Sophia also developed a sense of fondness in their teacher-student relationship.
Out of all the
Lookism
characters, she is one of the most copy-pasted by PTJ.
