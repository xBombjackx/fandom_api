Summary
Taegon Wi, also known as "King Gon", had fought with
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
before. He refuses to use his staff against people who do not deserve it. He chokes Daniel with his nunchuks and tells him that while his moves are stellar, he lacks the mindset for fighting. Daniel remembers Sophia telling him something similar as he blacks out, and then he sees the TikTacTok girl and gains the guts to fight back, kicking Taegon. He is about to lunge at Taegon when he suddenly falls asleep due to Jake waking his other body.
Jake tells Daniel that he is in the VIP room where they grow hallucinogenic mushrooms, what he suspects is the third affiliate's illegal activity. He also tells Daniel that he found out the secret of the room while Alexander was flipping tables: that the room itself rotates. Daniel tells Jake that in the rooms above the club influencers are drugged and taken advantage of. He begs Jake to save them and Jake says he doesn't care, he is only interested in finding Sinu. He switches off with Johan as bouncer but starts to remember Daniel's words. He calls Big Deal and asks them to send two people over, knowing Sinu would have probably wanted that. Jake and Lineman show up to the club.
