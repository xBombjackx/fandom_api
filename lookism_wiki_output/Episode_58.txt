Summary
The episode begins with unnamed spectators admiring Binu for her pedigree as a purebred retriever. These spectators then proceed to ridicule Enu, Binu's puppy, for not being a purebred retriever. Undeterred by their disparaging remarks, young Byeol insists upon raising Enu, suggesting that they "live together forever." As the two grow older, however, Byeol comes to regard Enu as others do. The frequent criticism directed towards Enu begins to influence her decisions; Byeol ceases to bring Enu along with her when she goes on outings, ordering the dog to stay at home. This eventually culminates with Byeol giving the order to stay when her family moves, and it is thus that the girl abandons the pet she'd once desired to live with all her life.
Enu, being an obedient dog, stays. She stays by the gate after the sky grows dark, and she continues staying after it darkens again. She stays after new occupants move into the house, and she stays after she has grown thin and dirty. She stays even after her ribs begin to protrude out from under her skin.
The neighbors pity Enu, and denounce Byeol and her family for leaving the dog behind. They do not report Enu's status as an abandoned pet, understanding that the common response to such animals is to euthanize them. The neighbors therefore make shallow attempts to help the dog by offering her food. Enu, however, reacts to them aggressively. She barks at them and bares her teeth, mistaking them for thieves. It is revealed that Enu believes the house to still belong to Byeol and her family, and that she must therefore perform her duty as their dog by guarding it until they return.
Night falls once more, and the temperatures with it. Enu is shown lying on the ground, shivering from how cold she feels. Her face is buried into the scarf Byeol gave her to wear.
The scene transitions to
J High School
. The nameless teacher who announced the arrival of
Daniel Park
as a transfer student now informs the Fashion Department's first-year class of yet another such transfer. As with Daniel, the immediate response from the class is to ask whether the student is a guy or a girl. Upon hearing that the student is a girl,
Kay Jang
,
Han Park
, and
Doo Lee
express great excitement. Then
Crystal Choi
walks into the room, and the trio sit back with dejected looks on their faces.
Daniel stares at Crystal, thinking of how unusual it is to transfer into a new school right before winter vacation, and of how similar the girl is to him. The girl in question, meanwhile, stands amid hushed gibes. She gazes out at her new classmates and mentally divides them into different cliques, categorizing
Mira Kim
,
Yui Kim
, and
Zoe Park
as "cool girls"; three unnamed girls as "outsiders," but also the group she belongs with;
Jay Hong
,
Daniel Park
, and
Zack Lee
as the "cool guys"; and Han Park, Doo Lee, and Kay Jang as "guys who mock and embarrass" her. Due to the treatment she receives whenever she transfers, Crystal is uninterested in school and chooses to hide in quiet corners while there. Daniel cannot tear his eyes away from her as he recalls the humiliation he suffered from his classmates in his original body.
Right after it is whispered that Crystal "looks funny" and is a "weirdo," Daniel approaches her. He greets her with a hello and a friendly smile, and introduces himself. The boy also chides Doo Lee for his comments regarding the area where Crystal lives.
