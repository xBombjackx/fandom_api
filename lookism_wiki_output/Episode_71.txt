Summary
At the cafeteria, the girls stare as
Zack
,
Jay
and
Daniel
walk in. A bunch of girls start gushing over Daniel, causing the classical music kids to get jealous. One of the kids is Beom, a freshman who is a popular online clothing model for the Oh Bok Hee company.
Daniel gets an offer to model for a start-up clothing company called Kian Clothing Company. The salesman doesn't make much but he offers to pay Daniel a good wage. Daniel gets a better offer from a wealthier salesman, making Beom jealous that his boss likes Daniel that much. He decides to think it over.
At night Daniel goes shopping with his mother at the department store. The wealthy salesman discriminates against
Daniel's mother
and laughs with Beom, calling them beggars. In the morning the other modeling company laugh at the poor salesman's rundown equipment. They are shocked to see Daniel emerge from his van.
