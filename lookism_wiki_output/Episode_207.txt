Summary
Zack begins fighting Scott Kwon and is way too fast for him. As he is backed into a corner he uses his fast lower body to speed past and knock out Scott. As Zack is leaving he mentions he is going to see a friend. Elsewhere on a park bench Johan is conflicted about Vasco's words. He is torn between his old self who was loved and his current self who is powerful. When Daniel approaches him he asks if they are still friends.
Zack is running when he comes across Scott, who wants a rematch. He refuses because they are not in a match, but when Scott is persistent he beats him and his gang. Scott recognizes Zack as second place in the middle school boxing match, and mentions that the first-place winner is his leader, Johan Seong. Elsewhere, Johan asks Daniel to join to God Dogs.
