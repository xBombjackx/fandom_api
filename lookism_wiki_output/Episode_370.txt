Summary
The police arrive at the convenience store and find Daniel passed out on the ground, and Wally popping bottles of butane. Daniel warns them that Jiho is on the run. Jiho threatens a taxi driver to take him to Gangbuk. Jiho heads to Ansan Public's base and says they still have a chance of winning if they can use Daniel's female friends as hostages. Jacky and Channing blame Jiho for their injuries and refuse to help in the slightest. Jiho wonders who he can go to for help, since Darius is missing. He remembers Jake Kim and decides to go to him. On the way though he runs into some old bullies from J High, and they pee on him.
Jiho comes to Big Deal's base and asks to see Jake. Jake Kim comes out and Jiho starts explaining his plan about taking over Seoul. Jake stops Jiho and tells him to go to the hospital first, since he's not okay. Jiho takes this as Jake abandoning him, and he takes out a knife. He says he'll tell Jake about Daniel's secret if he offers to take him in.
