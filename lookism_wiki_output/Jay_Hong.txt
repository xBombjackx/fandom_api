Jay Hong
(홍재열 Hong Jae Yeol)
is a supporting character in
Lookism
. He is a student in the fashion department at
Jae Won High School
.
Dino Lee plays Jay in the Lookism Chinese drama.
Appearance
Jay is somewhat taller than average, muscular, and has a fair complexion. His dyed long blonde bangs cover his eyes in all circumstances even when he faces strong wind, when he's turned upside down, to the point they never were shown since the beginning of the series. He is always dressed fashionably in high-end brand clothing and wears a variety of Chrome Heart rings on his fingers. He rides a motorcycle to school and carries a custom finger-print bag with him that contains a gun.
Personality
Jay is an extremely quiet person who is shown to never speak, making it impossible for other characters, except his relatives and (Big & Little) Daniel Park and Vasco, to understand him.  He is shown to be a strong fighter trained in Systema and Kali Arnis although he doesn't engage in fights without reason.
He is very notably drawn towards Daniel, to the point where his whole world rotates around his presence: Daniel is the only person that makes Jay exit his bubble to the point that almost all the interactions Jay has are with Daniel. He is shown to be morose whenever Daniel disappears in the story and is ready to help Daniel at any time with whatever he would need, ask, etc.
He is very generous, kind and observant, to Daniel particularly, as well as some other people.
History
Although not many elements of Jay's history were revealed, he is the son of billionaire
Steve Hong
, which makes him the younger brother of
Kitae Hong
and the older brother of
Joy Hong
. However, his relationship with his family isn't great: throughout the series, he is shown to be kept away from family events, being asked by his father to never call him again (after Steve Hong became aware that Jay was involved in a street fight), etc. The only family member he seems to have a good relationship with is Joy, who is often shown hanging out with him.
We also know that until Daniel's arrival at J High School, Jay was a very isolated student who never interacted with anybody norseemed interested in doing so. Since then, Jay opened up a lot, mostly to Daniel, whom he seemsto love more than anybody else, but also to a few other persons (
Vasco
,
Zack Lee
, etc).
In the more recent chapters, hoping to find
Daniel
(whose second body was kidnapped by Workers), Jay went back to
Sophia
, his father's bodyguard, to complete his training, which he dropped out of priorly due to the harshness of the training. He then joined the
Allied
crew, for the same reason.
Fighting Prowess
While having not actively participated in a breadth of fights, Jay has proven to be a very proficient and deadly martial artist. Jay is versed in 2 different martial arts: Systema and Arnis. Systema is a Russian martial art taught by and to special forces for the express purpose of killing or disabling enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible. In fact, Jay often has to put a motorcycle helmet on his opponents to make sure he can't kill them. Arnis is a Filipino martial art with a great emphasis on using weapons such as tonfas, staves, and karambits, along with a supplementary education in unarmed combat. With this martial art, Jay often demonstrates his skills utilizing BB guns

but has also attacked utilizing burning steel pipes, showing an ability to work with ad-hoc and makeshift weapons. Using these two martial arts in combination, he was able to overwhelm Scott Kwon, Dominic Min, and Jihan Kwak, more recently and after completing his training with Sophia Alexander.
Aside from that, Jay has demonstrated a strong tenacity and physicality. This is exhibited with him having endured burning his own hands to fight utilizing steel pipes and struggling against Logan Lee's submissions despite Logan's physical strength and endurance. He has shown himself to be very quick when it comes to hand speed, striking an uncountable number of times when having taken hold of his opponent,with James Gong noting that in in flurry that Jay could have "killed him 7 times" and being fast enough to counter Logan's natural durability, causing him actually to feel pain through his layer of fat.
