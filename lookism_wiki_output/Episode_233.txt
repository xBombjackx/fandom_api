Summary
Sally decides to allow Eli to stay in the spur of the moment. He proves to be a strange guest, bathing without closing the door and washing her underwear. She thinks he is a pervert, but he takes great care to stay away from her, saying if he is in a room with a girl then "he will get in big trouble".
At school Sally can't stop thinking about Eli. She finds out that he followed her to school and is embarrassed by it. When she asks he reveals that he has never been to school and was curious. Sally realizes Eli has been neglected as a child. He tells her that he feels safe around her, and that was the reason he doesn't swear around her anymore.
Warren Chae comes to confess his love to Sally Park. He doesn't like how close she is to Eli and tries to intimidate him. Eli bites his nose and swears at him, and Sally realizes he is scared of Warren. Warren tells Sally to close her eyes as he prepares to fight Eli.
