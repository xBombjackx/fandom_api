Summary
Moley hits the homeless man and tells Daniel to run. The homeless man chases them and Daniel gets second thoughts. He stops and refuses to follow Moley. They fight for the bag and it rips, scattering the man's money. Moley tells Daniel he will get revenge and disappears. The other homeless gather the money and return it to the man, and he is brought to tears.
The man explains he was saving the money to buy an outfit for his daughter's wedding. He abandoned his family to avoid harassment from loan sharks. He collected money from church alms to get the amount. At the homeless man's hideout he gives Daniel some advice and tells him to return home.
Daniel is sitting near a sewer contemplating when he is attacked by Moley, who came back for revenge. They try to steal the man's money and begin beating him. Daniel begins hallucinating and decides to run away, but is conflicted about the man. He is reminded of Duke and decides to fight Moley.
