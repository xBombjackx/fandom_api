Summary
Xiaolong considers killing Daniel, and that it would bring a lot of trouble. He eventually lets Daniel and Jake inside the room, which is now completely empty. They search but they don't find any trace of drugs or Sinu. Daniel suspects a secret room is inside there. Alexander Hwang tells him that Vivi only meets with the super rich and influential, so it will be difficult to talk with her. He asks why Daniel is acting poor when he can pay with his black badge. Daniel starts paying for everyone's drinks and the club starts getting wild.
Johan goes to Xiaolong because Sowol smelled like the drugs from the Pungsan cult he suffered through as a child. He says he has a question to ask him. Xiaolong asks if Vivi is ready, and since she is not he asks Johan to come with him. All of the expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol asks Daniel to come to the president. He comes to a room with several influencers sitting around sweets, along with TikTacTok girl. He eats some of the cookies and asks them where the drugs are, and they tell him that he just ate the drugs: Vivi bakes them into cookies called "Vivi cookies". Daniel faints and wakes up in his second body that he rushes into the club with.
