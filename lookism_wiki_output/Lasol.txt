Appearance

Personality
Lasol is a very kind and caring and polite person. She also seems to be a good teacher. She is also observant which can be seen when she noticed that Aru was feeling upset because she didn't get a chance to debut.
History
Lasol used to be the leader of Class A girls which she accomplished in her first year itself. She became good friends with Jang Udon and
Aru
and used herself as a cover for them to make it seems like Udon and Aru were just friends.
Later the Abo Investment Firm Rep who's name was Park Jin who was investing in a girls group gave Lasol and two other girls (Eunda and Sook) from Class A a chance to debut.
Park Jin and their boss - Mr. Jang - took her aside to see her in person. Park Jin offered to support her completely if she would date him. It seemed that she refused even though she was scared because she didn't debut.
After Aru debuted, Aru abandoned Lasol and Lasol was demoted to be the leader of Class C when
Daniel Park
,
Pyeon Duk Hwa
and
Hong Jae Hye
joined
PTJ Entertainment
.
Relationships
Jang Udon
As leaders of Class A, Lasol and Udon were very close friends. They were so close that Lasol was the only one to know that Udon and Aru were dating - an action that might lead to PTJ Entertainment kicking the trainees out. She helped them keep it as a secret using herself as a cover to make it seem that Udon and Aru were just friends.
They remained close friends even after Aru betrayed them.
Aru Lee
Lasol became extremely close with Aru when they were trainees. They were so close that Lasol was the only one to know that Udon and Aru were dating - an action that might lead to PTJ Entertainment kicking the trainees out. She helped them keep it as a secret using herself as a cover to make it seem that Udon and Aru were just friends.
On Lasol's birthday, Aru was broke and couldn't buy a gift. So gave Lasol her precious IPOT. Lasol considered it as a treasure and carried it everywhere with her.
After Lasol overheard about Park Jin's offer to Aru, she kept a distance from Lasol. Their friendship broke down. But even after that, she helped save Aru.
