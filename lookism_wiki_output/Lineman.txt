Bongae Choi
In the latest chapter, Bongae offered Lineman a chance to become stronger by learning from him, comparing Lineman to how he was in the past. As such, it is likely that Lineman will become Bongae's pupil.
Synopsis
History
Lineman used to be the head of the troublesome Monster crew in C Middle School, where
Jerry Kwon
used to go. He was responsible for collecting dues from the school and giving it to members of
Big Deal
. Lineman was a known liar, and he would often make up stories about being great to earn praise from other students.
When Lineman was asked about Jerry Kwon, he lied and said he beat him. He tried to collect dues from Jerry and in the process knocked over his bamboo flute. When Jerry told him to pick it up, he smashed his flute. Jerry got angry at Lineman but decided to leave him be.
Lineman continued to spread lies about Jerry until he learned that he was the same Jerry Kwon from Big Deal. When
Jake Kim
arrived at school, the other students exposed Lineman for lying about being friends with Jake. Jake was touched that Lineman thought highly of him, and accepted him into Big Deal. Lineman decided to follow Jake wherever he goes.
Eli Jang (Arc)
Lineman makes his first appearance in Jerry Kwon's flashback in middle school when he led Monstar.
Workers (3rd Affiliate)
Lineman took part in aiding Jake in his mission against Hotel Vivi, inadvertedly aiding Daniel.
Fighting Prowess
Lineman is not very strong but he is very resilient. He is able to withstand many hits without knocking out. He is a weak character when it comes to fighting but he is very determined to never give up and to keep hanging in there, no matter how badly he is in pain.
During the Incheon Arc, after training with Bongae Choi, a member of the 0th Generation, he claims to be at his "Peak" surpassing the strength he had in the past, a demonstration of his evolution and when he preferred to run rather than take public transport because it was faster to get to Incheon on foot. He has shown to have acquired the
Mastery
of Speed
which allows him to run as fast as vehicles and keep up with their speed, whenever he uses it instead of the typical blue aura an aura of lightning appears probably due to inheriting the will of Bongae Choe who was known as "Lightning Choi".
