to make it seem like he was the one who was the culprit.
When other students started to corner her for her story on her being loaded, she lied that she lost her wallet which, according to her, had money in it. But the truth was that it didn't. Her lie got out of hand and in a state of nervousness, hid it in a random locker she could find. That locker turned out to belong to
Vasco
. In the end,
Jace
was able to catch her as the culprit.
Later, Jasmine decides to sell paraphernalia using Mira's picture to pretend to be her. Zack catches Jasmine and tells her to never show her face around him. She disappears and he feels guilty about it.
