Summary
Heather is angry at Eli because of his text messages and he is doesn't know what is going on. When he realizes how hurt she is he decides to distance himself from her, believing he makes people miserable. She begins to cry and asks how he can tell her to abort his own child. Eli tries to chase after Heather at these words, but she leaves in a taxi and never returns.
Eli confronts Olly and begins beating him for causing the misunderstanding. Olly is unremorseful, saying Heather was only jealous and Eli would have said the same thing anyway. Olly then asks Eli where Lyon is, implying he killed him. Eli doesn't believe Olly and knocks him out. He tries to call Heather but reaches the gynecology clinic she is in. They inform him that Heather had an unexpected delivery that day, and he needs to show up immediately.
As Eli is about to leave he is stopped by Gun, who demands the monthly payment from Hostel. He is angry that Eli is not paying attention to his responsibilities as a head of a crew. Eli retorts that money cannot buy a family, and he is going to see Heather even if it means fighting Gun. Gun decides to test Eli, saying he will only allow him to leave if he is still alive after.
