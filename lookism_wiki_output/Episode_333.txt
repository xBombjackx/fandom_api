Summary
Huseong Ha was abandoned at a zoo when he was a newborn. A male gorilla decided to raise him, and he treated it like his mother. The authorities took Huseong out and he entered society, but he was always curious about why humans are weak. He joined the army and later founded the Gorilla gang. Later on, his gang was sold to the Bicheon gang by the authorities. Xiaolong approached him at dinner and asked him to help protect someone.
Huseong asks Jerry if he is trying so hard because Jake is watching him. Jake offers to get the badge for Jerry but he tells Jake to take Lineman and Daniel and leave. Once they are gone, Jerry punches Huseong into the wall, and his head breaks a hole into it. Huseong realizes Jerry was hiding his strength to not outshine Jake. Lineman returns and sees the wreckage, and Jerry tells him not to reveal that he is stronger than Jake. Vasco comes across Hwang Ho and uses Brekdak’s 7th forbidden move, dough kneading. Hwang sees it coming and blocks the attack.
Samuel Seo calls Xiaolong and asks him if he’s scared he will go down. Xiaolong says he doesn’t need help, since Johan is reliable enough. Samuel offers to help out if Xiaolong barks like a dog.
