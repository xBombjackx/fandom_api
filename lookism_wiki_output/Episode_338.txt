Summary
Xiaolong starts using his broken arm as a whip. When Xiaolong dodges his fingers he slashes him in the face with his hair, which is concealing blades.
Hwang Ho recalls meeting with his peers: Huseong Ha of Gorilla gang, King Gon Taegon Wi, Hongwol Sowol Jin and Hwang Ho. Taegon wanted to see who is the strongest by fighting, and Hwang decided to challenge him. When Hwang asked why they were fighting, Taegon said because he is obviously the strongest of the four.
Hwang Ho decides he will go full force for Vasco, and Vasco warns him that people die from Brekdakâ€™s five most powerful skills. They prepare to fight each other when Johan walks by. They try to talk to him but he one shots them and walks away. Daniel starts climbing outside the hotel so he can get to the penthouse.
Eli is in the elevator when Johan opens the door and demands a badge. Eli asks if Johan thinks he is some pushover, and Johan says to give the badge or else he will kill him.
