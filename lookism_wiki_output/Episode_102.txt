Summary
Daniel notices he is being treated better by the Class A kids than before. Aru complains to her manager that she is gaining weight, and he is resentful towards her for her selfish personality. Her boyfriend comes in and beats her manager for not taking care of her.
Daniel and the others take a photo but Duke is not invited to. As the manager leaves he hits Daniel for not bowing to Aru. Duke calls Daniel and tells him the door is locked, and he asks Daniel to bring the key. Daniel wakes up in his other body and goes to give him the key. When he gets to the door he runs into the Class A kids, who look at him in disgust.
