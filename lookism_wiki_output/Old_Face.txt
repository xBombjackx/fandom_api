Appearance
Old Face is estimated to stand at 6'3", with a gray buzzcut. As his nickname suggests, he has a wrinkly face which makes him look much older than his age. This is also commented upon by peers. When he is introduced in the
Eli Jang Arc
[

]
and
Jake Kim Arc
, he is shown to be wearing Big Deal clothing, which consists of a black blazer, with black trousers, and a white collared shirt. This never gave an indication to what his figure looked like, but later he is revealed to be lean and toned with muscles upon his shoulders, arms, and bares a six pack.

Personality
Old Face, back in the Jake Kim Arc, was shown to be ruthless and two faced. He did have a sense of loyalty to Big Deal, however he also had a sense of disloyalty as well due to the fact that he was never truly loyal to Sinu Han's ideology, but he would always follow Sinu Han's orders and do every one of his tasks that were given. We know his sense of loyalty to Sinu Han was not all false as he respected Sinu Han for his strength and acknowledged him as Big Deal's Big Boss, at the time of the Jake Kim Arc, and stood up to Goo, well was about to, until Sinu Hand had told him not to get involved, which Old Face respected and stood down.
Based on the type of people that Old Face chooses, and from what we have seen of him as a character and how he rose to the position that he was in Big Deal, it is very clear that he prefers those with power, influence and money, e.g. Samuel Seo, which is just like himself. When Sinu Han had planned his final act and had told Old Face that he was going to give up his ideology and sell Big Deal to workers this hit home to Old Face due to the fact that, 1, Sinu giving up on the ideology meant money finally coming to him, which shows his greed and, 2, being sold to Workers meant that they would gain money and, he himself, would climb his way within Workers and gain power, which also comes with influence as well.
In summary Old Face is loyal/unloyal, greedy, and wants to gain power one way or another no matter what he has to do.
