Summary
The people who knew Olly mourn his death. Chuck and Justin scatter his ashes at a riverside and burn the money they earned from Hostel B. They ask the little Eli what he will do. He eats Olly's ashes and says he was meant to be alone since he is an Eli. Johan observes the small funeral and says he didn't plan on coming, but he happened to be wearing black.
Jasmine and James are on the run again, this time with the abandoned kids Olly was raising. Jasmine sews jackets for them and is happy to play the mother, but James is annoyed since Olly is dead. He decides to play the father.
In Japan, Gun expressed his condolences to Olly. Big Deal wears black for his funeral, and Jake lights a cigar under an umbrella. Jin Jang meets with a Workers member in a bar, who congratulates him on destroying Hostel. He offers Jin Jang a bronze badge, and he bows.
Hostel B meet at Heather's grave to let her know that they sent Olly off. Sally asks where it all went wrong and starts crying. When they arrive at the hotel, Eli tells them that he'd like to live with them. Gun is disappointed to hear this. The kids turn to see that he is holding Yenna.
