Summary
Olly decides to test James, thinking he showed up for the position of uncle. James fights Chuck and isn't as good a fighter, but he takes the hits well. He asks if he can use a doll as a weapon and knocks him out with a brick tied to the doll. He draws a star on his face and Olly is impressed by his creativity. Elsewhere, Daniel asks Riley how to contact Hostel and he tells him to text 'FR' into his personal phone. The FR stands for family recommendation, and he receives a message telling him where to go.
