Welcome to Lookism Wiki's editing policy! To keep our pages consistent and organized, please do the following.
General Guidelines
All articles should be written in English.
Use the present tense when writing, unless it is about a past event.
Reference information as often as you can.
Page Format
Character Pages
Write the character names from the English translated Webtoon. Korean names are provided at the top of the page to clarify the character for readers that use other platforms.
Each character that is mentioned by name should get a character page. However, minor characters have a different character format than main characters, as they do not have enough information to warrant the usage of tabbers.
Relegate major plot information to the “History” and “Synopsis” sections of the character pages.
Please pertain to keeping information to the subject header. Many people will write other characters stories when it does not pertain to the page nor subject itself.

Episode and Arc Pages
Each episode that is released should get its own page.
Arc pages are meant to compile episodes from the same arc/chapter. They follow a similar format to episode pages.
Title each arc the way it was released. Title each episode with "Episode" and the number following. Example: Episode 56.
If an arc has the same as a character or organization in the story, add (Arc) at the end of the title. For example, Jake Kim is a character. His page is titled “Jake Kim”, and the arc named for him is titled “Jake Kim (Arc)”.

Article Information
Spoilers
Spoilers are defined as any major information from episodes past the official English release (such as the Korean episodes). These are allowed on pages.
To hide spoilers, use the source editor to add the
SpoilerBlur
code. If it works correctly, it should blur the spoiler unless you hover over it. SpoilerBlur works on infoboxes as well. An example is shown below.
Code
:
<span class="spoilerblur">INSERT TEXT HERE</span>
Example
:
It was revealed in later chapters that DG is the true identity of James Lee
Note: Spoilerblur does not work on comments or discussion pages. It also does not work on the mobile site unfortunately. You can switch to the desktop version by clicking “View Full Site” at the bottom of the mobile wiki page.
Non-canon Information
Canon information refers to information found in the comic or stated by the author. When adding information to pages, please only cite canon information by including a reference or link. This will keep pages as accurate as possible to the source material. If you have speculations and theories about characters and events, post them in the comments section or the discussions page.
Fan-made Content
Fan art should not be used for official character pages. Fan art can be uploaded on blogs and user profiles.
Additional Guidelines
Please edit using the classic editor or source editor. Visual editor can mess with the formatting of the page.
Please do not use span and span style number of how short or big the font size is unless on the home page. You can use "br" and "small" when editing.
Images can be added directly, or inserted into a page via a Gallery. Title the images appropriately and write the context underneath.
If someone with a page is mentioned, place a hyperlink to their page.
When writing a quote or citing information, include a reference for the episode.
You can tag pages with Categories to make them easier to sort out. To find pages with similar themes, you can type in the search box Category:[Whatever you're looking for].
Reference information as much as possible so it can be assumed to be credible.
Proof of the page screwing due to using the visual editor
