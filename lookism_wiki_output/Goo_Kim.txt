Goo Kim (김준구
Kim Joon Goo
)
is a supporting character and an antagonist in Lookism. He is Charles choi's former bodyguard, the former debt collector and former chief of security of the HNH Group, one of the ten talented individuals raised by the HNH chairman, and one of the three kids trained by
Tom Lee
.
Appearance
Joon Goo is a lean-built man with glasses and dyed blond hair. He is always shown fashionably dressed, in a similar fashion as Jong Gun. Contrary to Gun, Joon Goo dresses in relatively lighter colors, (white and gold) as opposed to Gun's (grey and black). [1]
Personality
Joon Goo's Crazy side
Joon Goo comes across as unpredictable and indifferent. Most of the time, he appears to be an easygoing person, and he even retains this laid-back attitude in battle, even against powerful opponents like Logan, Johan, Gun, Sinu Han, and Daniel. However, beneath this carefree façade, he can be extremely violent and sadistic. This is shown when he tells
Vasco's
bullies that he is a villain, just like them, before viciously striking them in the face with a chair. Tom Lee mentioned that Goo only becomes serious when he is wielding a sword or anything similar.
He has showed a strong interest in money. Joon Goo was eager to make some additional money, even if it meant returning to juvie due to the consequences of his activities. However, in Vasco's
backstory
. Goo recognized that "there is a knife and a victim" and decided to offer his service on the house. This is because he realized that he found violence more satisfying than the money he initially requested. He despises being underestimated and might become enraged when it occurs. He is known to become rather serious when wielding a sword or anything resembling one, and he regards swords with the utmost respect, as evidenced by his telling Robert Choi of the Black Bear Gang never to use a sword again.
He is shown to use the phrase “Holy!” Most likely picked up from hearing
Tom Lee
say it.
Synopsis
Background
Goo fighting Gun.(Flashback)
Several years ago, Jong Gun was sent to challenge Goo in a duel. While the outcome remains uncertain, it was clearly a brutal battle, leaving both men with serious injuries. After the fight, they joined forces in the debt collection business and amassed 20 billion won. It is revealed that later on Goo fought
Gun
again because Gun left Goo in the debt collecting business to guard
Crystal Choi
, again the fight outcome remains unclear but it is confirmed that Goo was indeed the one who gave Gun the scar between his eyes, whereas Gun caused Goo to need steel pins in his body, implying broken bones/ligaments.
Before the events of Lookism, Goo Kim was seen in the Manager Kim webtoon to be a bounty hunter, being given the title of "Lunatic" by Zu Pengguan, a major character in the series, hunting down the bounty on Tian Wai Tian's last successor.
Fighting Prowess
Serious Goo
Goo is a highly skilled combatant and one of the strongest fighters in the PTJ-verse. While his full range of abilities remains unknown, it is clear that he possesses exceptional strength, as he is on par with
Jong Gun
. However, unlike his partner, Joon Goo excels at turning any object he picks up into a weapon. Despite this, his raw strength and stamina are remarkable, as seen when he shattered three camera stands in
108
and endured a relentless assault from Johan Seong in chapter
263
. When wielding a sword or anything similar, he becomes significantly more serious, dropping his usual playful demeanor. He possesses incredible durability, which is evident in every battle. At the beginning of a fight, he often takes numerous hits—though it’s possible he does this intentionally. Once Goo picks any object or weapon up, the outcome of the fight is almost always determined, regardless of his opponent. His fight with Johan Seong was already determined when he picked up a piece of wooden lumber. Another display of his skills is when he defeats
Sinu Han
just by using a chopstick after sharpening it.

He is also shown taking out hundreds of experienced weaponized adults when he was 16 alongside
Gun
(who was also 16) in chapter
310
. He is the heir to the Korean sword, which leads him to finally act seriously when wielding the weapon. It is possible he was trained in Kumdo (A proficient sword art of Korea) and Kendo. It is also possible that he is trained in Fencing, Iaido, Eskrima, Silat, and other Weapon-based martial arts; which would explain his specialization in weapons usage and extreme physical capabilities.
Nitoryu (Twin-Sword technique)
Goo Kim's Twin-Sword Technique
Goo Kim is able to wield a sword so skillfully that he is able to use two of them in the same instant, further allowing him to deal maximum damage and use a technique called "Moonlight" which comprises of 3 phases that aim to kill the opponent.
First Sword: First Moon
Goo dashes forward at high speed and stabs in its direction with one sword, aiming to target the torso.
Second Sword: Crescent Moon
Goo uses both his swords to swing diagonally, cutting everything in its path.
Third Sword: Full Moon
Goo uses both swords to release a flurry of slashes in all directions, slicing everything and anything.
Zero Sword: Eclipse
In a last ditch attempt, Goo intentionally lets the opponent flank him and stab both himself and his opponent at the same time, ensuring that he gets pierced through the left of his chest, avoiding any major organs while piercing through the heart of the opponent who is attacking from behind.
Unarmed Combat
Goo Kim's abilities when unarmed are unknown, due to his habit of getting hit and not fighting seriously when he doesn't have a weapon. So it's almost impossible to say how strong he is. In episode 97 of the
Manager Kim
webtoon, Goo is shown fighting against Park Jincheol (A major character of the series, bearing the alias of "God of War"), being able to dodge his attacks, take hits and being able to land a clean hit in return, showing that he can hold his own even without using a weapon.

Goo Kim has been described as one of the "Three Lunatics" by Zu Pengguan in
Manager Kim
episode 98.
It's implied that Goo's fighting style is likely to be a superior form of Arnis, due to Logan Lee comparing him to Jay Hong when they were fighting him.
He is even trained in martial arts like Kendo, Iaijutsu, Kenjutsu, Iaido, Jōdō, Bōjutsu and even Sōjutsu. These martial arts are not much known but his mastery in these incredibly rare swordsmanship skills is what makes him a feared opponent when he actually gets a sword (katana).
Goo is shown to be wearing Gun's clothes on several occasions like the iconic Yellow button-up shirt or the Black suit which he wore in the 1st affiliate arc. This is even confirmed when he told Jincheol Park in
Manager Kim
episode 100, that he cannot let him ruin the suit as he borrowed it, from  a hot headed bastard (Gun).
He is a sadist as shown when he enjoys violence and brutally beating up perpetrators/bullies just because it's fun.
He loves money.
He loves branded goods.
