Summary
Leonn Lee has started working at a gas station because she wants to be close to Vasco. She has to dress like a girl for her job to attract customers, so Vasco doesn't recognize her yet.
At the karaoke place the animation department is touched by Logan's dedication towards them. Hope Park is a fighter who relies on his strength, so having Logan beat him is unacceptable. He tries to rush Logan but Logan uses his jiujitsu skills to slip past and hold him in a lock. As he passes out he fears that Johan will have to fight a monster.
Back at the gas station Vasco is surrounded by God Dogs, who ask him to wash his car. Vasco agrees to the task, unaware of the implications.
Johan
arrives after
Jin Jang
