Summary
Daniel
is traumatized when he sees
Logan
and does everything he asks, just like Pavlov's Dog.
One of the girls
gives Daniel his mother's gift and he is disappointed he didn't fight for the money. He decides to use his other body to get the money back.
Daniel gets to the bus station and meets
Jay
, who is also going on a solo trip. Daniel is headed to Sunukdo, and
Jay
is heading to Busan for a vacation. He changes his ticket and gets on the train with Daniel.
Notes
Pavlov's dog was a famous experiment where a scientist conditioned a dog to associate food with a bell. In Daniel's case, he associated Logan Lee with fear.
