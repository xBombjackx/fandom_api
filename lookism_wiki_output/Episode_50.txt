Summary
Logan
tries to hit
Daniel
but he smacks his arm away. He runs towards
Jay
to pick him up and sees Logan towering over him. Daniel panics and is frozen in fear, but Logan decides to let them go because he is intimidated by them.
Jay wakes up a short while later when Daniel is carrying him. He explains that Logan is a local gangster and asks why Logan attacked Jay. Jay pulls out the lucky charm, and Daniel realizes Jay came with him to get it back. He cries out of shame, because he couldn't be brave even in his new body.
Daniel tries to return the shirt to the store when he discovers it is stained. The people refuse to allow him until they see Jay. They give him a new shirt and Daniel wonders if Jay used to be an employee. When he returns to his neighborhood, he asks
Vasco
to train him and decides to change. Back at the old neighborhood, Logan is back to bullying people.
