Summary
Johan is disoriented from the betrayal. He asks his crew why they betrayed him, and Jin explains that they never liked him to start with. They only put up with Johan to get revenge on the Burn Knuckles and now they didn't need him anymore. They decide to break his arms to cripple him, but he gets up quickly. Johan decides to destroy the God Dogs and the Burn Knuckles and make a new crew.
As Johan fights the God Dogs, Vasco feels pity for Johan. Daniel attempts to help him but Vasco holds him back, claiming he doesn't deserve it. Gun shows up as Johan is about to beat Jin and tells him that he is disqualified for his poor leadership. Johan begs Gun to reconsider but Gun refuses to, telling Johan he had his chance. As Johan starts crying for his mother Gun warns him not turn out like Jake. Johan becomes desperate and decides to fight Gun, and Gun removes his glasses.
