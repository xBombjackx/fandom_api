Synopsis
Episode 112
Vasco
realizes that, even though original
Daniel
had persevered in exercising for 3 months already, he wasn't getting any thinner. So he's determined to find out why. That day, Vasco followed Daniel to the convenience store.
When a customer began to berate Daniel for not heating up the food and was acting really confrontational, Vasco told him to heat it himself, and that store employees are still people. Daniel tries to get Vasco to stop because the customer is known for his bad temper, but, instead, the customer apologizes meekly.
Later, when a middle-aged looking woman comes over to buy alcohol, Vasco asks for her identification. Angered, she asks how old they were to be ordering her around. Vasco replies he's 16. Daniel tries to explain that the lady has bought alcohol every day already, but, instead, the woman apologizes and calls Vasco "oppa," showing that she was actually younger than them.
When nobody was coming, Daniel began to exercise during the break. Vasco watches him, wondering why he wasn't losing any weight even though he was so diligent. Suddenly, Daniel sits down, saying he's very tired so he should replenish his energy. He starts wolfing down a hamburger. Vasco realizes the reason why Daniel can't lose any weight is because he's eating so much and orders that Daniel goes on a diet. Daniel can't stand it, and starts wondering why his other body wasn't getting fat even though they both eat the same amount. All of a sudden, he realizes the fifth truth: his other body's shape can't change.
The next day, at the cafeteria, Daniel heaps food onto his plate and wolfs it all down. Girls, seeing him, giggles and says he eats like a man. However, when Ji Ho tries to do the same thing, they call him uncivilized and dirty instead.
However, at night, Daniel realizes that, no matter how much his new body eats, his original body is still very hungry. When he goes training with Vasco in the morning, he feels weak and hungry. He takes out a banana that he had saved from before, but Vasco snatches it away, saying that he shouldn't eat it. Daniel starts to cry, and, when Vasco takes a large bite of the banana, something breaks within Daniel because, whenever Daniel is very hungry, he would lose control. He rushes at Vasco, arms flailing. Vasco tries to tell him to calm down a little, but Daniel punches him hard, and Vasco is only barely able to block it.
Episode 113
After
Daniel
punched him,
Vasco
, frantic, gets into a fighting stance, trying to tell Daniel to calm down. As Daniel lunges to punch Vasco he hits Daniel in the neck, rendering him unconscious.
Daniel wakes up in his new body, embarrassed that he had acted the way he did. He realizes that he had completely lost control and puts on his jacket to go and find Vasco and his unconscious other body. However, just as he tries to call Vasco, he sees his vision blurring again.
It turns out that Vasco, had woken him up by sticking the banana in his mouth. Apologizing and crying, he promises that Daniel can eat the banana. Daniel, realizing that his other body was now lying unconscious somewhere, tries to tell Vasco not to wake him up, only to feel himself losing consciousness again.
Daniel wakes up in his new
body to see
a girl
above him, trying to wake him up. She asks if he's alright and apologizes, saying that she saw him suddenly faint. Daniel wonders if there had been someone there earlier, but thinks nothing of it. Thinking he must have scared her, he reassures her that he's fine and thanks her. The girl suddenly retreats, apologizing for touching him, and Daniel, thinking she must be very introverted, says she shouldn't apologize and if anything he should thank her for helping him.
At that moment, Vasco rushes over crying with original Daniel on his back. He explains that he called the emergency number 102 but nobody picked up. Daniel tells him it's 120, but secretly feels relieved that it was Vasco to find his body, because he couldn't remember the number to call the ambulance. Meanwhile, the girl thinks that Daniel has fallen in love with her and that, this time, her love wasn't one
side. At the same time, she picks up the key to Daniel's room that Daniel had accidentally left behind.
In a flashback, the girl remembers her backstory. She used to have a crush on a boy called
Heemin
, but he rejected her because she was ugly. In school when she was older people would gossip about her, saying she's gloomy and that they're unlucky because they have to work in the same group with her for a project. Even now her neighbors would still gossip about her, going so far as to say that she should leave because she was bringing down the house prices. She would scratch at her arm, thinking that nobody loves her that she was very lonely.
The scene then cuts to PTJ's CEO
DG
.
Crystal
asks DG what he's plotting with her dad because her dad doesn't tell her anything. She congratulates him because he's looked happier after becoming the CEO, but he says that his good mood isn't because of his job but because his stalker finally stopped contacting him.
Daniel is working in the convenience store while a storm is going on. He thinks to himself that it would be terrible if he had lost his key in this weather, so it's lucky that he found the key outside his front door. Meanwhile, his new body sleeps at home. As the thunder rolls, the girl he had met that morning crouches in front of him, grinning.
Episode 114
Daniel wakes up the next morning to find that all the dishes in the sink were clean. He is confused because he doesn't remember cleaning the plates, but blames it all on the diet, saying that he's been rather forgetful lately. When he leaves to go to school, he sees the girl shivering outside his front door. She calls out Daniel's name and makes small talk with him. He wonders why she is sitting in the cold and realizes that she's eating something as well, but he doesn't comment on it.
She suddenly holds out her hand and asks if Daniel likes her ring, the same ring that she had shown her childhood crush. Daniel tells her it looks really pretty and asks if she's made it herself. Just when she's about to ask him another question,
Zoe
shows up, offering to walk to school with him. The girl grows jealous of Zoe, who doesn't notice and hands her a hot pack. When they leave the girl remembers how Daniel had told her to go back home and believes Daniel would love her alone. She then takes out the key to his home, saying that she'll listen to him and return to their "love nest."
When she enters Daniel's home, she says "I'm back," as if she were returning to her own home. She then smiles that hes's used her dishes, which she licks clean. The girl goes to fold the sheets, only to find original Daniel sleeping in them. She gets angry and grabs a kitchen knife to kill him.
Episode 115
At that moment Daniel arrives, coming home after a rough day. He looks around and sees that the room's suddenly become cleaner and wonders if he's hallucinating. He then notices the kitchen knife lying on the ground next to his mattress and the dishes are washed. As he takes a shower, he decides that his mother couldn't have come over and wonders if it is a manifestation of his dual bodies. Meanwhile, the stalker watches him take a shower.
As Daniel dries his hair, he walks over to his original body, slapping himself awake to get ready for work.Then, he uses his new body to continue drying his hair, saying that he doesn't want to go to work and deciding to eat before he goes. All this time, the stalker watches, wide-eyed, from behind the bathroom door.
Crystal walks by Daniel's home to see the stalker taking out the trash. She says that there are only two boys living inside that house, and asks who she is. The stalker replies that she and Daniel are one and that they are family. She then asks if Crystal is his friend. Crystal replies "ah, yes" whist wondering if the stalker is his sister. The stalker girl, angered by this reply, asks if they are close, and Crystal is scared and answers no.
Meanwhile, at Daniel's convenience store, Zoe is speculating whether or not the girl is stalking Daniel because she says she'd seen her before too, but hadn't paid much attention. She says that, now that she
thinks about it, it seems kinda strange and wonders if the girl might have entered Daniel's home. At that moment, Crystal barges in worriedly, sweating from running. Crystal and Zoe both wonder who the other is, because they keep seeing each other around original Daniel. When he asks if she needs anything, Crystal replies that she's not there to buy anything but wants to know if he has a sister. He rushes home, scared, and looks around, only to find nobody there.
The next day, Daniel tapes pieces of tape to the door, and, when he rushes home, realizes that they hadn't been touched, showing nobody had opened the door during the day. He pushes the door open, and sees nothing has been touched and everything was just as messy as before. He rushes to the sink and is incredibly relieved to realize that the dishes hadn't been washed either.
In a moment of dramatic irony, the scene cuts to a cockroach, and then zooms out to show that it was crawling on the stalker girl's face as she lies in the space under the kitchen sink, grinning and saying that, as long as she's able to see Daniel, she would be happy. As she lies under the sink, she sees original Daniel slap his new body to get ready for school, and wonders why, whenever he switches bodies, one of them falls unconscious. She grins creepily as she realizes that it means that she should be able to take one of them.
Episode 116
The next morning, Daniel and Crystal see each other while jogging. Crystal asks him whether he comes exercising everyday after work. Daniel replies yes, and that he exercises with a friend (Vasco) every morning before going home. Crystal, finding something in common, exclaims that she also often exercises as well. Daniel looks at her suspiciously, wondering if she's bragging about staying in shape. At the same time Crystal thinks that original Daniel is kind, fond of small animals, determined, and hard working, and wonders why someone as good as him would live with someone like new Daniel.
She asks Daniel whether the stalker's been coming around anymore lately, and he replies that no, she hasn't, and thanks Crystal for helping, but asks how she knew which place was his. Crystal, not wanting to reveal that she's been investigating him under orders of her father, explains that she saw it when she came over to feed Enu. The stalker angrily wonders who she is and decides she must have her eyes on new Daniel and wants to steal him away.
Zoe comes over right afterwards, asking if he'd seen the stalker again and offering to walk to school with him. She then notices how the place where Daniel lives isn't really fancy so she asks what Daniel's parents do. He answers that his mother does a little of everything and Zoe mistakenly believes that his mother's in charge of a huge company that dabbles in a bit of everything and is incredibly impressed. Unbeknownst to them, the stalker watches them from within Daniel's room, and thinks that Zoe is there to seduce Daniel as well. She wonders when the permission form will be sent to her, and frantically check her cell phone only to smile when she realizes that it's just been approved.
While at school, Daniel tells his classmates about his stalker. Zoe offers to walk with Daniel to school every morning, and says it'll be great if original Daniel comes along as well. Jay suddenly hands Daniel a utility knife and tells him to keep it. Daniel doesn't know why Jay is handing it to him but accepts. As he looks down at his hands he sees the ring the stalker had on, and realized that it must have been put onto him while he was asleep, showing that the girl was still in his home.
Frantically, he runs back home and realizes that his original body had disappeared. He looks all over the place for a sign of the stalker. When he checks the space under the kitchen sink, he realizes that, although nobody was there, there were a lot of soiled adult diapers. The stalker girl appears behind him and tasers him.
Episode 117
When Daniel wakes up, he finds that he isn't in pain and realizes that he's in his original body, but he can't move because he's been bound. The stalker is seen coming out of the bath, talking to an unconscious Daniel. She says that the two of them can live together forever, and that she's put the "annoying pig" in a place where nobody would ever find him.
Meanwhile, original Daniel tries to scream under the tape on his mouth and flails in his bonds. He tries rolling around and falls onto the ground. Suddenly, he feels something sharp and starts to use it to cut at his bonds. When he is finally able to take off his blindfold and open his eyes, he finds himself in a room that is covered with his own photographs. He realizes he'd fallen out of the closet full of wine bottles, and the sharp object he had used to cut off the ropes was actually a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After wondering for a while what he should do, he decides to run to the police office.
The policeman, upon hearing his story, are surprised at hearing his story and commends him for running to report it immediately. When Daniel gives his address, the first policeman tells Daniel to wait a moment because the address Daniel had given was an hour away from the police station, which didn't fit with Daniel's story that he had directly ran to the police office after he saw the crime. The police then comments on how Daniel smells of alcohol, and decides he must be drunk. When Daniel replies he hadn't drank, the police admonish him for lying and begin interrogating him.
Suddenly, Daniel loses consciousness as his other body wakes to find himself bound to a chair with his arms behind his back. They're in another room that's also covered with pictures of himself, and there's a circle of candles surrounding them. He asks her why she's doing this to him, to which she replies that they are one. She explains that this is their new home, and she'd specially decorated it for him, and that there were even some couple photos of them. She also explains that she's eating his fingernails and toenails as a snack, which she ate earlier when Daniel saw her outside his door.
Daniel exclaims that she can't do this, that she'd also kidnapped his "friend" and that this was illegal. However, the stalker only turns around, grinning, saying that she knew his "little secret".
Episode 118
The stalker girl reveals that she knew about the fact that Daniel had two bodies, and that he changes by slapping himself. Daniel doesn't correct her, and decides to figure out where he is. When she refuses to tell him, he says that he won't marry her. The stalker is angry, thinking he's lying to her, and tasers him again.
When Daniel wakes up in his original body, he's still in the police station, and the police still think he's lying. He asks Crystal for help. The police promise to help and are very reverent towards Crystal because it turns out she's very close to the department head. When Crystal asks how Daniel had contacted her without a cell phone, he explains he'd sent a message to original Crystal and asked her to pass the message on. Crystal offers to help find new Daniel, and Daniel thanks her and leaves, saying he's already found a lead.
Crystal calls
Kouji
and tells him to locate Daniel's cellphone. The Kouji tells her that he's not going to do it, but Crystal only tells him Daniel's phone number and hangs up. She looks incredibly angry and says that nobody should bully her Daniel.
Original Daniel, on the other hand, heads to a telephone stand where he calls the number of the noodle restaurant where the stalker had called for takeaway. He'd memorized the phone number of the restaurant while tied up in his new body. He asks the restaurant to tell him the address of the woman who'd called for two bowls of noodles. However, when the restaurant owner hears his request, he seems to mistake Daniel for a stalker instead and hangs up.
Crystal had already gotten the address from the Kouji through text. He tells her that it's a good thing Daniel's cell phone was still on, and tells her she shouldn't go alone and should bring Gun with her. She replies that Gun had went with Goo out of the country, and that it was an emergency, so she can deal with any danger by herself. The Kouji replies that it's true, she isn't pretty when she gets mad either, and tells her that it's free this time, but he wants her to think over his last request some more. As she gets closer to the address the Kouji's sent her, Crystal starts to get a little scared. However, when she arrives, she starts because she realizes she's been here before.
Episode 119
The stalker girl appears behind Crystal, and tasers her, believing she is there to seduce Daniel. She ties her up in a chair next to Daniel, saying that they should settle this dispute between themselves before “her husband” wakes up. Crystal then says that she knows the stalker, because she was also DG's stalker. The stalker asks if Crystal is talking about her ex-boyfriend, and says that she seems to have an interest in all of the stalker's past boyfriends. She continues to say that Crystal can have DG because she is already married now. The stalker's wearing a headdress, a white dress, and holding flowers, but Crystal realizes that the headdress is actually lace underwear and the stalker’d made the wedding dress herself.
Crystal asks her if she knows what she's doing. After all, she'd already kidnapped 3 people already. The stalker laughs and tells Crystal how she'd always been discriminated against because of her looks, but immediately starts talking about how a pig (original Daniel) would dare to sleep in her spot without even realizing how unfit he is. Crystal points out this discrepancy, telling the stalker that, even though she blames society's lookism, she herself is only attracted to handsome guys. Angered, the stalker lunges forward to taser her, only for original Daniel to walk in through the door.
In a flashback, original Daniel had continued to call the noodle restaurant, telling the owner that he was trying to help a friend who was in danger. The owner, hearing that he was trying to help a friend, changes his mind about the matter extremely quickly and tells Daniel the address. To his surprise, it turned out to be his home.
The stalker asks how he changed bodies when she hadn't slapped him, and Crystal is surprised to hear this. Daniel wants to use his strength to defeat the stalker, but the stalker throws a candle at him, and, when he's dodging the candle she tasers him. He falls unconscious and wakes up in his new body. Meanwhile, Crystal starts crying for the stalker to stop hurting original Daniel while the stalker continues to electrocute his unconscious body. She calls the girl a stalker, and the stalker tries to taser her but Daniel takes the hit, telling her not to hurt Crystal. The stalker begins to hit Daniel repeatedly until he is covered with blood.
She then tells him he should apologize, because then she'll forgive him, but she doesn't know he is only buying time for Crystal to escape while handing her Jay's utility knife. However, even though Crystal's hand was on the door knob, she hesitates to leave him behind.
Episode 120
The stalker noticed Daniel looking in her direction and launches herself at her, taser out. The scene cuts to
Gun
who is on the phone with the
Kouji
. He tells him that Crystal had left alone, and worried for her, had phoned Gun to ask when he was coming back from overseas. Gun says he's coming back soon, and that Goo was still having a lot of fun beating someone up. He continued to say that he isn't worried about
her because he'd taught her some moves earlier.
Crystal kicks the stalker's head,causing blood to come out of the stalker's mouth. She says that this is a lot less than Daniel had to suffer and locks the door, telling the stalker to prepare to have her ass handed to her. The stalker cries and tries to squeeze Crystal but she aims her elbow at the stalker's back, incapacitating her in one blow. As the stalker falls to the ground, Crystal uses the taser to electrocute her. Daniel, thanks her, and she asks him why he'd let her go earlier. When he replies that it's because she's a girl, she continues to say that the stalker's a girl too, and tells him to stop judging people based on their looks. She realizes this may be the first time they’d seen each other for who they were inside.
The police had arrived and had put the stalker in handcuffs. As the stalker is led to the police car, she cries for her "husband", trying to explain that her "husband" had two bodies. Meanwhile, the people around her snicker, saying she's lost her mind. Daniel smiles, thinking that nobody would believe the stalker's words, but, behind him, Crystal, wide-eyed, seems to realize the truth.
Epilogue
The stalker girl asks two guys if they like her ring, and they answer that it's really pretty, if she made it herself, and that she was very good with her hands. They ask her if she has an accessories shop and where it's open. It turns out that the stalker had become really pretty. While in prison, she met a girl who had kept some makeup from the guards, realized the stalker girl could become really pretty, and taught her to apply makeup. When the stalker girl leaves prison, she uses the new technique to look beautiful, and she suddenly realizes that everyone's asking her for contact information and even offering her jobs. The story ends with the girl from prison telling her the moral that who you are inside doesn't matter because, in this world, everyone only cares about appearances.
Cookie
In the cookie we see a teacher in the staff room talking to someone about how close they were to becoming a Sophomore & finishing their first year, it's then revealed that the student the teacher was talking to was in fact
Logan Lee
, who wants to transfer due to a fight.
Notes
When the police are speaking to Crystal they use the term "千金" in Chinese, which refers to a girl close enough to be your daughter.
