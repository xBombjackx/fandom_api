Synopsis
Backstory
As a baby, he and his brother have been weighed a lot more for their age. His brother, Ivan, when he was a baby, weighed 51 kg, while Hope himself, weighed a lot more, at 92 kg. As of Chapter 203, there is not much about him other than the fact he fought Logan.
Fighting Prowess
Hope Park is arguably one of the strongest characters in the series. He never worked out or picked up a martial art due to his innate strength. He was capable of driving
Logan Lee
into a corner and even pick him up. However, this proved to be his downfall as he lacked the skill necessary to beat Logan Lee in a contest of fighting skill. In chapter 252 he was able to learn wrestling from his brother and become more skilled. In the end, he still suffered a loss again against
Eli Jang
.
