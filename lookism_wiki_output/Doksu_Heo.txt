Synopsis
TBA
Fighting Prowess
The King of Pyeongtaek trained his fists, this can be seen by looking at the scars he had on his fist, and his strongest attack is his punch that comes from below. As for his level, he would scale similar to the King of Suwon, since defeating Seokdu required the combined effort of pre-mastery Eli and Samuel(Warren didn't do much) while the King of Pyeongtaek was defeated by the duo of Eli and pre-mastery Warren.
