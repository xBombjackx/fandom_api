Summary
Logan is having a hard time fighting Jay due to his long range pipe attacks. He grabs his own pipe and heats it, and uses it to choke Jay. Jay retaliates and the two begin choking each other.
Hope Park
watches and relays this to Jin Jang, while Gun and Goo continue to talk about Logan.
Daniel is having a tough time fighting Zack. Zack reveals the reason he returned to fighting is because he couldn't beat Logan, but he is more intimidated by Daniel. After faking out Daniel with a punch, Zack decides to let him go. Daniel calls him back to fight and he copies his exact moves, using even stronger punches like Gun's. He decides to let go of Zack the same way he let go of him, and Zack gets angry. He leaps at Daniel, who is slow to block his moves. Zack gets encouraged and says he knows what Daniel's weakness is.
Elsewhere, Jin Jang comments that nobody is there to stop him. As he says this, Johan Seong arrives in Gangdong with
