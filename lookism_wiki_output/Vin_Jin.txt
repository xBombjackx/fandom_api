Personality
Vin Jin has quite an arrogant and selfish personality, believing he is the most handsome student at J High. He wishes to be superior among everyone, feeling jealous when someone else is better than him. This leads to bullying being his resolve, stepping on others so he can remain at the top. His carelessness makes him get into fights that he has a major disadvantage in.
Whenever it comes to his eyes, he is very secretive. He covers them with tinted sunglasses, making him considerably handicapped when it comes to his sight. It was once stated that he tinted one pair of his sunglasses six times and was virtually unable to see.

However,  Vin Jin is quite insecure about his eyes and attempts to hide them even without his sunglasses, panicking when faced with the prospect of having them taken off. It is revealed in Chapter 381 that  Vin Jin's insecurities stemmed from his polycoria, going as far as attempting to gouge it out as a child due to being stigmatized for it.
When it comes to his friendship with Mary Kim, he is shown to cover his considerate feelings with his playful comments and makes objectionable ideas. Deep down, he cares greatly for her,

going as far as to beat up Hostel members for using photos of her in their business.
Fighting Prowess
Vin Jin specializes in Judo,

[

a martial art of unarmed combat that derives from Jujitsu. It mainly consists of unbalancing or flipping the opponent using one's leverage abilities. Later, it is discovered that he also specializes in Kudo,

]
a martial art that originates from Japan where one uses punches, kicks, and submission techniques to overwhelm their opponent. In addition to this, he is well informed of dirty fighting and Korean wrestling.

At the beginning of the comic, he is largely known for acting better than others, causing fights he has no mercy in. Later on, revealing that his sunglasses handicap  Vin Jin to the point he is almost blind. It is found that he is an extremely proficient fighter and martial artist. Without wearing his handicap, his speed, strength, and techniques are exponentially enhanced, as demonstrated when he easily took out Ivan Park.

He has stated that he could beat those who are on the same fighting level as Daniel, Logan, and Zack Lee when he was in middle school.  This had been the definite case before most of the
2nd generation
main
characters
reached mastery. Furthermore, Eugene implied Vin's strength is greater than anyone else's who is capable of being in the circus through his letter grading and possibly comparable to the likes of
Ryuhei
, or at the very least at the level of
kings
.
By the time the cast began fighting against the Workers Second Affiliate, Vin Jin was able to destroy trees barehandedly and pose a serious threat in the underground fighting ring.
When  Vin Jin joined Allied to combat the workers with his own goal being revenge on Taejin Cheon for his crimes upon Sujin, the two from Cheonliang were given the opportunity to fight to the death. It was also stated, in the battle, that Vin had gotten stronger than his middle school prime. However, at the climax of their fight, Taejin revealed just how much of an astronomical gap there was between the two. This is still relevant to  Vin Jin because he had reached a point of being at the higher level of kings while being considered one when  Vin and Taejin in the past weren't far off from each other in level. The consideration in itself is due to him being likely responsible of overtaking Cheonliang by first murdering the Cheonliang king.
The final piece of information about  Vin's power is the relevancy of Cheonliang throughout all of the generations as it is the breeding ground of monsters. The other known example, besides the two from the 2nd generation and the Cheonliang king from the 1st generation, is Jinyoung Park.  Vin's narrative in the next arc of Cheonliang starts with his flashback/backstory, which will be about the 1st generation and himself 10 years ago.
Fights
He was shown to do basic slaps, punches, and kicks, additionally grabbing opponents by the hair or collar.

He had attempted a leg sweep on
Vasco
but failed to cause damage, getting handled by Vasco's one-handed flip.

When in conflict with
Logan
, he grabs him by the collar, saying "rubber rubber arms," (most likely referencing Luffy from One Piece). Then, he grabs Logan by the collar and forearm of his shirt, attempting to flip, but gets beaten in return.
During  Vin Jin's fight with
Ivan
, after the removal of  Vin's sunglasses, he can increasingly rely on Ivan. After Ivan's counter-attempt to  Vin's Judo flip,  Vin tackles Ivan by the neck. He successfully evades Ivan's grapple endeavors with speed, attempting to pull him down by the arm, and is captured in Ivan's arms. He breaks out with his strength and lifts his arms.  Vin Jin then counteracts with a forbidden Judo move called Kani Basami, similar to Wrestling's 'Scissor Takedown,' in which he interlocks his legs around his opponent's waist and can either lay them on their back or break their knees.
During his fight with Akira during Worker's Second Affiliate Arc in the fighting ring, he showed monstrous reaction speed avoiding Akira's attacks and then he dislocated his arms rendering him unable to fight. While fighting Sato Kazuma in the lobby he was beaten one-sidedly but didn't flinch. Once he fought back, he pulverized Sato by lifting and slamming him on the ground thus ending the fight quickly.
In the recent chapter while fighting
Changyong Ji
he was unfazed by this headbutt and his attacks he picked
Ji
with one hand and slammed him on the ground repeatedly. When Ji tried to remove his grip Vin didn't even budge thus it proved his monstrous grip strength.
It was later revealed that he was the disciple of the First Generation King of Cheonliang
Seongji Yook
, who taught him how to fight. Seongji said that  Vin Jin had a lot of potential and he just triggered it by training him, It is also revealed that he was the son of
Jin Mujin
the legend of Korean wrestling and ssireum, a fighter said to be on par with
Gapryong Kim
. Yook also taught him his father's fighting style called the
Mujin Ssireum
, where one can break the opponents' bones with their monstrous grip strength.
