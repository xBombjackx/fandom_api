Summary
Jiho notices the money has not been deposited to his account and grows nervous. He visits the gambling office and the people are gone. They removed Jiho from the list of players and kept his money, and they refuse to deposit what he won. Jiho asks Jace about John and Jace doesn't know where he is. Jace grows worried about Jiho and
Vasco
says he should help him because he is Daniel's friend.
Jiho goes to the loan shark office and tells him he will pay when he finds Jake. The man tells him finding Jake is not his responsibility and that Jiho had better pay or he will be in legal trouble. Jiho goes to wallow in a park and is kicked out by the homeless. He recognizes the homeless man and asks him for help, but gets robbed of his clothes and money.
Jiho returns to the store and apologizes to Daniel for stealing. Crystal tells Jiho she knows someone who can help him and calls
Kouji
