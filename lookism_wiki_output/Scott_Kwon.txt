Synopsis
Profile
Scott Kwon used to be an athlete in the Olympics. He has a cocky personality and does not take no for an answer.
Johan
sent Scott to attack the
Burn Knuckles
, so he challenged
Zack Lee
to a boxing match. When Scott turns physical, Zack decides to fight him and wins the match. He is the one who told Zack that Johan was the leader of the
God Dogs
.
Scott is incredibly skilled at his sport, which is what made
Jin Jang
interested in him. When the God Dogs joined
Big Deal
, he tried to take Jin's place by force, but Jin had already analyzed his fighting style and won the fight easily. He and Dominic Min were later set up against Jay Hong, and they lost that fight as well.
