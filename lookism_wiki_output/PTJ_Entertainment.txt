Organization
Classes
PTJ Entertainment has a strong heirarchy with a strong emphasis on ability. Trainees are separated into 3 classes: A, B and C.
Boys from Class A
Daniel's class, Class C, was only just created when he arrived.

Class A seems to be composed of more talented and senior trainees while C is composed of greener and less talented trainees.

Class C is the only co-ed class, whereas Classes A and B are separated into female and male groups.

PTJ Trainee Rules
Trainee rules
The training program seems to be incredibly harsh. A list of rules for trainees is seen stuck to a pane of glass.

Translated, it says:
Impolite, uncivilized people will be fired
There can be no incapable people here. Those who slack off will be fired
Those who smoke or drink alcohol will be laid off
Those who are late more than 3 times will be laid off
Those who have romantic affairs will be laid off
Those who do not show improvement at the end of month evaluation will be laid off
Expenses for trainees
Food expenses
One of the reasons why Daniel decided to become a trainee is because of the fact that the company gives an allowance for food expenses. A class is given 6000 won for meals whereas C class is only given 4000 won for meals. This is one of the ways the company discriminates based on trainee ability and tries to encourage hard work within the trainee community.

Trivia
PTJ Entertainment may be a fictional version of YG Entertainment, considering the fact that DG is inspired by G-Dragon, who comes from YG. There's also the fact that YG is involved with a series of scandals, and is known for illegal behavior in the Entertainment, while in PTJ, many of the idols and employees behave the same way, as shown when they blackmailed Aru with her nude pictures.
