Summary
Zack pulls ahead near the end of the race. Since Mira is watching, he is determined to win.
Young Mira shows young Zack her stuffed bear Brownie, calling it her best friend. Zack calls it childish, and asks what he is if the bear is her best friend. As Mira drops Brownie, Zack demands if this is how she treats her best friend when he realizes Mira is in pain. After running Mira to the hospital, it is revealed that Mira had burst her appendix, but she thanks Zack, saying that he was amazing.
Meanwhile, in present day, Zack runs out of stamina. Daniel overtakes him by 0.04 seconds. In the talent show, Daniel and Duke perform again.
Zack is sitting on the steps, mourning his loss, when Mira and Daniel come to find him. He does not hear Daniel's explanation for being with Mira and instead assumes that it is because he is a loser. However, Mira drops her phone, which Daniel fails to catch. However, Zack is closer to the phone and is able to catch it. Mira says he has saved Brownie again, and Zack sees the bear keychain attached to her phone. Again, Zack is called amazing, and he is in renewed spirit as he heads to the party. At the party, he continues to catch anything that is dropped.
