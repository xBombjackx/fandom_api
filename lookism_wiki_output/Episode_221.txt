Summary
Zack beats up some Hostel members looking for Jasmine. Daniel is getting hazed by the leader of the runaway fam Riley Oh, who asks him to drink a disgusting liquid. Daniel drinks it despite the girls protesting, and is allowed into the family. When he later throws it up the girls reveal the reason they ran away from home was because they had unstable families.
The girls are called out by Riley who wants to use them for 'roleplaying'. He picks the inexperienced girl to go with him and Daniel tries to come along but he is told to stay behind. The other girl cries that she isn't ready for it yet, and Daniel asks what the fuss is about. He learns that Riley employs his girls in prostitution scams to earn money.
The girl's client is in a shower attempting to wash before their meeting. He comes out to find an angry Daniel telling him to piss off. As the man tries to run he is hit by Riley, who accuses Daniel of ruining everything. Daniel asks the girl If she wants to continue to live this way, and she reveals that she doesn't but she also doesn't have anywhere else to go. Daniel slaps Riley and tells him to prepare himself for a beating.
