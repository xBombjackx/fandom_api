Summary
Daniel performs with DG and the crowd goes wild. Later he goes to talk to DG, who remembers Daniel. He tells him that he will talk to him once he manages to unite the
4 crews
, since Daniel is still in high school.
Seonong cries to himself about how Soomi prefers Daniel. He runs into Vasco and tries to trick him by pulling plastic bars on a jail cell. Vasco is amazed at his strength and does the same thing with real bars, even putting them back together. The Burn Knuckles come to Vasco's aid and one of Seonong's friends hits Leonn, triggering Vasco. He decides to beat them for hitting his junior.
