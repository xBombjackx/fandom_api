Summary
Crystal
is walking by the hair salon when she spots
Eli
with his daughter. Eli is worried she will judge him but she is pleased he is taking responsibility. He is reminded of Heather and asks if Crystal would be willing to watch
Yenna
while he works. Crystal happily agrees, but is robbed by God Dogs in the bathroom.
Eli races to Crystal's aid and ruins the hair of Dominic Min, who chases him angrily. When Dominic finds out Eli is a father he begins harassing him, and brings a cigarette close to Yenna. Eli smashes his face in the wall and warns him to stay away from his daughter before beating all the God Dogs in the room.
Elsewhere,
Goo
and
Gun
discuss Gun's successors. Gun is worried about Johan because Johan doesn't have much experience leading a gang, unlike Jake. Goo asks if he is still hung up on his previous successor, Eli Jang. Crystal is amazed at Eli's fighting skill but Eli grows sad, believing he will never be more than a thug.
Johan explains to Daniel that he sees a lot of himself in Daniel. He offers him a position in God Dog, telling him together they can earn a lot of money. He goes to find the OBs but they are brought to him by Vin, Logan and Vasco in comatose state. The three of them are angry at Johan and decide to fight him.
