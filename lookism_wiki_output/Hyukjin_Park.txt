Fighting Prowess
Hyunjin proved to be a Judo practitioner, managing to throw Vasco and Jin Hobin at the same time before they could react with enough force to break the floor of the establishment, superficially injuring them. However, when the fight continued, he proved to be inferior to Jin Hobin in terms of Judo and grip strength, being defeated in two throws by him.
