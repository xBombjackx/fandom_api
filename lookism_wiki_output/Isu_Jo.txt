His body is covered with tattoos almost until his wrists, shown in chapter 497.
Personality
Isu almost never has an extreme reaction, he always acts calm. He's also very cautious and secretive at times, as shown in chapter 446 and 447, even showing looks of suspicions when talking to Jihan Kwak. He's also a professional haggler, claimed by his subordinates in chapter 447.
Relationships
Cheon Taejin
Isu respects, believes in, and faithfully obeys Cheon Taejin, following him wherever he goes, even helping him put on his suit or lighting his cigarette.
Kim Gitae
In a flashback of chapter 497, Isu is shown to be opening the car door for Gitae, driving him to a destination afterwards. This implies that he's one of Gitae's lackey. Further proving, he's only listening to Taejin because of Gitae's orders.
Synopsis
Fighting Prowess
As stated by Cheon Taejin, Isu Jo cannot fight, especially when it comes to his offensive skills, but he does show good defensive skills, having managed to block a punch from Zack Lee using his elbow and striking him with the same albow.
