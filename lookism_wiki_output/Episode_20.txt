Summary
The next day
Jay
is surprised to see
Daniel
greet him, but Daniel thinks Jay is a good person for trying to stop his fight with
Zack
. He overhears Daniel talking about his birthday tomorrow. The Burn Knuckles and the class rich kids make plans to humiliate Daniel.
As Daniel is walking home he runs into Jay, who gives him clothing for his birthday. Daniel is surprised Jay remembered and only accepts the gift when he tells him he doesn't need the clothes. In another alleyway, the
Burn Knuckles
lay defeated by Jay, and they wonder who he really is.
Namsoo
and the rich kids are waiting to expose Daniel when he walks in wearing Jay's expensive clothing. The other kids remark about his old wallet and he mentions it is from his mother. Namsoo is shocked to see Daniel can carry unfashionable items and not care about it. Daniel tries to greet Jay but he doesn't respond, so he keeps moving. Jay smiles shyly to himself in his seat.
Jay has a flashback to the night before he gave the clothes to Daniel. He struggled to write a letter to him asking to be his friend. In the end, he decided against the letter and simply wrote "Happy Bday".
