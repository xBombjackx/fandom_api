Summary
Brekdak asks Alexander Hwang, who is now working as a valet at the third affiliate, to step aside. Other Workers members ask what is going on, and he explains that Brekdak is looking for someone. They tell Hwang they were going to report him for running a food truck without a liscence, and Brekdak backs off to save his business.
Jake tells Xiaolong that White Tiger Company sent two people, and there has been a miscommunication. Xiaolong decides to call Tom Lee and ask if he sent two people, and Tom surprisingly says that he did send two people (one of them being Gabriel Park, one of the guards Vasco defeated) and that only Johan needs to be interviewed. Johan is suspicious of Jake's persona but Xiaolong and Vivi are convinced he is legitimate. Jake decides to become a bouncer and find more information about Sinu. Xiaolong tells both of them that he only needs one bouncer, and the one who manages to get Vasco out of the club is the one who will be chosen.
The two of them confront Vasco, and he refuses to fight them, saying they are both good guys. Johan rejects the offer and says he will continue to fight, and that he learned some moves from a guy in Gangbuk who knows taekwondo. The three of them decide to fight each other.
