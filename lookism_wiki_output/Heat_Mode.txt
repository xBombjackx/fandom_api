“It happens occasionally. When your body becomes hot in the middle of a fight. To be brief, it's self-hatred. You can't stand feeling disgusted with yourself. Why is this all I can do... Why can't I do more when I tried so hard... It's from your deep inside, what comes up becomes... The "self-hatred", "Sense of Inferiority", "Self-reproach". These sense of inferior emotions... are turned into hysteria.
