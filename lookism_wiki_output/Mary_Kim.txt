Mary Kim (김미루
Kim Mi-roo
)
is a student in the Vocal and Dance Department of
J High School
.
Appearance
Mary Kim is extremely beautiful and tall for the average Korean woman. Having the height of 165 cm, she is taller than
Mira Kim
and
Crystal Choi
. Her complexity shows that she has pale skin, dark blue eyes, and an hour-glass figure. Her hair is bleached blonde and is later permed.
She typically wears stylish outfits, mainly wearing a black hoodie with a skirt. She tends to always be wearing a patterned bandanna. Occasionally, she sports a black snapback.
In the past, Mary's physique was different, being having a muscular with a noticed fatness, and having short hair. It is confirmed that she got surgery to gain her new appearance, which Vin always teases her with her past physique.
Personality
Mary Kim has a laid-back yet honest personality and hasn't been seen as the type to easily stress or get frustrated about something. For a considerate amount of the chapters that she is involved in, she is set off as a character who just remarks what
Vin Jin
says.
However, after the Hostel Arc is completed she is shown to be very outgoing and playful. She is seen fooling around with many of her past friends but may be seen as frightening in their eyes. In addition to this, she has great leadership qualities, as she takes a stance in leading her class to give ideas for the school festival, and even leads a Judo team in her hometown, Cheonliang.

History
Mary Kim was a 15-year-old Judo genius and an undefeated middle school league legend.
Described by Vin Jin as a human weapon that every coach and manager wanted, she won gold medals in every competition she joined. Mary was nicknamed "Empress of Two Seconds," for one second to grab and another to turn over and throw down her opponent. Vin Jin reminisced that he could not ever defeat Mary back then in their Judo days.
The following year, at the age of sixteen, she lost 40 kilos, becoming the person she is now.

Jace Park
Much to his annoyance, Mary enjoys squeezing Jace's ears. She flirts, claiming that they are soft, small, and squishy to touch. However, he keeps rejecting all her attempts of flirting.
MC Pesticides
The two were both from Cheongliang and appear to have history with one another. MC Pesticides ran away after seeing Mary causing a member from the Cheongliang gang to comment that he must be feeling guilty.
