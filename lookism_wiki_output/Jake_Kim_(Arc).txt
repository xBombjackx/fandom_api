Synopsis
Episode 302
Jake Kim
is introduced as the king of C Middle School. Brad Lee and Jason Yoon are two of his juniors trying to usurp him from the throne by beating every student in their grade. However, Jake decides not to fight them, and they end up gifting him some gum. The other students come for revenge against the two, and Jake ends up saving them for the favor they did earlier. The two swear to follow Jake wherever he goes. As he's leaving the school, he runs into
Sinu Han
, the leader of
Big Deal
.
Episode 303
Sinu asks Jake to join his gang, but Jake refuses because he hates thugs. Sinu also sent his second in command Old Face to recruit
Samuel Seo
, leader of the Gangseo Alliance. Jake and his crew are wandering down a street that is owned by Big Deal, and learn about the rivalry between them and the Black Bear Gang, run by adults. Samuel surrounds them with his gang and challenges Jake to a fight, saying he wants to prove who is the stronger of the two. He is jealous that Sinu acknowledged Jake and not himself. Jerry Kwon rolls up with his bicycle to join the battle.
Episode 304
The Gangseo alliance begin fighting with Jake's crew. Despite their small numbers, they are doing well for themselves. Jason Yoon is called Jeju's Crimson Stallion due to his fancy kicks, and Brad Lee is called Gangwon's Hippo because of how he locks onto opponents. They mistake Jerry for Jake's father, although Jerry is younger than Jake. None of the students want to get close to Jake and Samuel, who are throwing heavy punches at each other. Alexander tries to encourage Samuel to fight like his gangster father, and Jake mentions how he hates his father, who is also a gangster.
Amidst the fight the Black Bear crew pull up, and order the students to stop fighting. Most of the kids flee, except Jake's friends and Samuel and Alexander. The crew asks who they are, and they say they are from Big Deal, in an effort to appear tough.
Episode 305
When the Black Bear gang try to fight them, the kids decide to run, but they ran in the direction of the Black Bear gang's territory. They are caught and tied in the gang's pool as they interrogate them. Jason and Brad quickly confess to not being Big Deal, but the gang leader decides to kill them anyway to spare his reputation. Jake offers to go first, but before they load him into their van, Sinu Han appears to rescue them.
Episode 306
Sinu blackmails the leader with a Newtube video he made, explaining that he will save the kids captured by Black Bear. If Sinu doesn't return, the video will be uploaded and they will gain a reputation as child killers. When they escape from their territory, Jake and the others learn Sinu was posturing the entire time. He invites them to come eat with him.
Alexander begins bragging that Samuel is the son of a gangster, and Jerry blurts out that Jake's father was also a gangster. Then he asks why Sinu is protecting this particular street, and he tells him the girls who work there are really pretty. Jake is angered by this and dumps his food before leaving. He remembers that his father used to cheat on his mother, and he is disappointed Sinu is like that. Samuel doesn't seem to mind, remembering that his father would say similar things.
As Jake sits down to think, he is approached by one of storeowners, a girl called Yeonhui. She tells Jake that he is wrong about Sinu, and that he was only joking. Sinu has been protecting her street ever since he was a child, and he usurped the previous owner so he would have the manpower to continue doing so. The people on the street came to know of him as the "Boy of Promise", and they pay him a fee out of their own gratitude. Jake decided to visit Big Deal once more, and along with Samuel, they became members.
On a rainy day, Jerry was walking back from school. He came across Johan Seong passed out in the floor, and recognizes him from the news.
Episode 307
Samuel Seo is patrolling the streets after becoming Big Deal's number three. He smacks a man who forgot to wear his jacket, and Sinu isn't pleased with it. He feels that Samuel is not being a good leader, but Old Face disagrees. When Samuel comes to the clothing store, he notices that the girls are distracted. He finds them surrounding Johan, who was brought in by Jerry Kwon after he decided to make him a member of Big Deal. Samuel tells Jerry they don't have money for new members, but Jerry insists that he will let him stay until Jake complains. Johan tearfully decides to leave, and the girls complain at Samuel, saying Johan is only trying to take care of his mother. Samuel tells Johan that he needs to toughen up if he is going to survive, and he recommends stealing shoes to make quick money. Sinu gives Johan some money on the way out, and Jerry wonders if he will see him again.
Meanwhile, Jake is accosted by Olly Wang, who is eager to join Big Deal. Jake asks Olly why he wants to join, seeing as he isn't from a poor family. Heather apologizes for him and berates Olly for joining. Jake tells Olly he might let him join some other day, as he reminds him of himself.
The Big Deal members decide to have some fun on the beach. Samuel asks Jake how long he plans to stay in Big Deal, as Sinu is going to retire soon. He plans to head to Gangnam later, because Big Deal is too idealistic and small to suit him. He asks Jake to come with him, but he refuses. He says the only reason he joined Big Deal was because it wasn't like the other gangs. He resented his father for not caring about his family. Samuel is curious to know who his father is, and he tells him it is Gapryong Kim. Samuel's cigar slips out of his finger, because that is the name of the man he suspects is his father.
Late at night, Goo barges into Big Deal's store, asking if Sinu would like to join one of his four major crews. Gun is annoyed by his loudness, and Sinu is shocked and worried to see Goo.
Episode 308
Goo attempts to introduce himself, but Sinu hits him and tells the others to get back, because he is much stronger than him. Goo begins fighting Sinu, but Sinu's punches are actually doing damage. Big Deal are surprised to see Sinu fighting this hard. Sinu heard from other gangs that they have been defeated by Goo as a test, and his friend Jagalchi told him that he needs to be prepared for this. Sinu tries his best, and Gun feels as though he might be able to beat Goo. Goo takes the chopsticks Sinu was eating with and sharpens them into a weapon, which he begins slashing him with. As Sinu is being beaten, Goo tries to stab him, but Jake catches his hand with the chopsticks. Gun calls James Lee, a student, to tell him that Big Deal will now run Gangseo.
Episode 309
Gun tells Big Deal that they made the cut, and he expects a 100 million won by the end of the month. The leaders of the gang sit down to discuss their prospects. Old Face proposes using the girls to make a profit, and Jason adamantly opposes it. Jake gets up to leave the meeting, saying they shouldn't make a decision without Sinu present. Samuel also disagrees, saying he will find a way to make the money himself.
When Jake goes to meet Samuel, he is standing by the lighthouse. Jake asks how he plans on making the 100 million won. Samuel tells him to get lost, because he can't stand seeing Gapryong's son. He is jealous of Jake, but he isn't aware of why.
Later, Goo and Gun come to a warehouse to collect their dues. Jake and his crew attempt to stop them, but Goo notices that they have the money needed. Samuel tells Goo that the money is ready to be collected, and kicks it before he can count it. He tells Goo that he has to test him before he can hand him the money. Black Bear gang are upset that Gun and Goo are trying to take down their enemies, and have decided to step in to assert their dominance.
Episode 310
Samuel has a flashback to when he asked the Black Bear gang to help him. He used the stores as collateral to ask for a loan of the Black Bear gang: they would pay the stores, and in return the gang would help them defeat Goo and Gun. However, he bet that Gun and Goo would defeat them, and in return he would not have to pay a cent. Gun is impressed by his foresight and wants to congratulate him, but Samuel gives Old Face the credit of the plan. Jake is disgusted by Samuel and decides to leave, reminded of his own father. The Black Bear gang eventually goes out of business.
Goo heads to a house in a neighborhood, where he finds Charles Choi sitting on the ground with a few others. He greets the workers head, who has just managed to make a name for his gang. There is also another person in the room: James Lee, one of the ten geniuses.
Episode 311
Samuel takes control of Big Deal, and orders one of his members to refuse the girls food unless they reach their quota. He asks if the others will listen to someone other than Jake, and Samuel beats him in a rage. He discusses his decision with Old Face, who agrees happily with the decision. Sinu pulls up on them and punches Old Face. He asks why Samuel has gone from being ambitious to leading with cruelty. Samuel reminds Sinu of his favoritism towards Jake, and tells him he isn't needed in Big Deal anymore. Jason and Brad prepare to leave Big Deal, but Jerry refuses to leave until Jake returns.
Sinu meets Jake at the lighthouse and tells him he has a plan to beat Gun, but Jake is skeptical. Sinu asks if he is hesitant to fight because of his father. Jake tells him he is correct, that he is trying to avoid the drama. Sinu tells him he doesn't have to join Big Deal, but he would like him to at least protect the storeowners, since he isn't strong enough to. Jake comes back to his mother's house and asks what kind of father he was. His mother confirms that he was a piece of shit, but would do his best to help those less fortunate than himself.
Jake comes back to Big Deal to find Samuel beating Jerry, who is trying to protect the girls. He tells Samuel he has never decided who the leader is, and while he dislikes fighting for passion, that he will do so regardless. Gun is sitting on a bench to watch the fight.
Episode 312
Samuel has a flashback to when he first learned about his father. He created Gangseo Union so he could become a gangster like Gapryong Kim. He would follow him to  his campaigns and protect him from civilians who harassed him and were angry about his crimes. Samuel's hope was to become prominent enough to be able to approach Gapryong. When he came back from seeing Gapryong for the first time, his mother showed him his real father, an tradesman who abandoned his family a long time ago. The picture he cherished of Gapryong was taken by his real father during an outing with his mother. Gapryong also has a vasectomy, so he couldn't have children after Jake.
Samuel was so enraged he tried to choke his father. He made himself believe Gapryong was his father, because the alternative was too painful to bear. He never did get to meet Gapryong, and he is angry that Jake has the life he dreamed of. However, his emotions make Samuel unstable in the fight, and he ends up losing to Jake. Gun congratulates Jake on his victory. Sinu arrives at that moment to show Jake how to defeat Gun
Episode 313
Sinu folds and reveals that there isn't a way to beat Gun; he and Jake should just surrender. Jake is livid and tells Sinu to give him the secret, but he tells him to wait. Gun has given him a card to contact the Workers, saying that if he cannot deal with the crew, it is best he sell it. He tells his plan to Old Face, and he asks the members of Big Deal to join him. Most of them do, but Jason and a few others refuse to leave Big Deal. He calls Jerry and tells him to take care of Gangdong, so he isn't present for the selling of Big Deal. Yeonhui overhears him and realizes that Sinu doesn't plan on selling Big Deal, but selling himself. Old Face and his crew decide to take down Jake on the orders of Sinu. He and the YB crew defeat them, and Jake hurries to stop Sinu from selling the crew.
Episode 314
Jake doesn't believe that Sinu would sell Big Deal to the Workers, but he doesn't see through the lie yet. He tries to beat Sinu into shape, but he is too easy on Sinu. He beats him proper and tells him that he did sell the crew, for 100 million won. The leader of the workers actually decided to rate him 1 billion won, for his prowess against Goo. Sinu asked to raise it to 1.2 billion won, to last them one year. Sinu continues to egg Jake on, even saying that he doesn't need the girls because Gangnam girls are more attractive. Jake tries his best now, but he is still too weak, and is knocked out by Sinu.
Sinu gives Jake his jacket, and makes his way to the Workers. Their leader tells Sinu that he will now be considered property, and no longer allowed to contact anyone. He is now No. 8 in the Workers, and his office is a giant cage.
Episode 315
Jake is preparing to leave Big Deal when Yeonhui gives him a recording Sinu made and never uploaded. Jake learned about the plan to gain enough money, and that Sinu expects him to defeat Gun and Goo in his place. At the monthly deposit, Gun asks Jake if he will be able to buy Sinu back, given his cost of $5 billion won. Jake tells him to be quieter, because nobody knows of this except himself and the storeowners. The storeowners offer to help buy Sinu, but Jake refuses because they are like family to Sinu. Jake hears about a gambling scheme being held in Seoul, and he begrudgingly decides to accept the position.
Samuel is also trying to get stronger to defeat Jake. He begs Gun to give him a second chance to be his successor, and Gun tells him to make a name for himself with his Gangseo Union. Samuel decides to weed out his weaker members by beating them, hoping that Gun would be impressed by his smaller, stronger team. Gun is disgusted by his actions and beats Samuel, telling him that he still hasn't learned why he was disqualified in the first place. The Gangseo Union abandon Samuel, and he is confused as to why he wasn't accepted.
Samuel hunts down Johan to ask him why he wasn't accepted, but Johan tells him to get lost. Jake and Olly also arrive, and both are surprised to see Samuel there. Apparently Gun summoned the crew leaders to see who is the strongest of them all.
Episode 316
Gun and Goo make a bet for 10 billion won on who will win. Gun bets on Gapryong's son, who is incredibly strong, and Goo bets on Olly Wang, who cannot feel pain. Johan attacks Jake first, and he is surprised that Johan is the same kid who came to Big Deal. Jake tells Johan that he is too kind to join a gang, and he should return home. Johan asks Jake to bet that whoever loses gives their territory to the winner of the fight. Olly quickly dispatches of Samuel and tries to beat the other two, but they ignore him and fight each other.
Samuel is wondering why he lost so hard. Everyone he looked down upon is stronger than him; Johan who was a crybaby, Olly who was a loser, and Jake who he thought was beneath him. Goo goes to take a picture to show Gun who won the fight, and the scene he sees shocks him. Samuel has already beaten Johan and Jake, and he strangles Olly until he passes out. Goo asks why Samuel wants to Gun to approve of him so badly. He already approves of Samuel, and asks that he become his new secret friend.
Episode 317
Jake's friends begin asking about the numbers racket, and Jake refuses to tell him. He is losing money quickly, and the head of the scam slaps him and asks if he wants them to fail. He tells Jake that making money isn't easy, and he has to sacrifice something to get what he wants. Jake remembers Gun's offer to earn money by becoming his successor, and swallows his pride, deciding to continue the gambling scheme. Even though he sees the pain of the people getting scammed, he decides it is worth it if he can rescue Sinu and save Big Deal.
When Vasco came to demand Jiho's money, Jake was reminded of himself. However, even his attempts to earn money were shut down when Gun disqualified himself. Jake recalls all of this as he wakes up in present time. He commanded Lineman to bring every member of Big Deal so they can attack the Workers, and force Gun to show himself to them.
Episode 318
Samuel Seo, now promoted to the rank of President of the Fourth Affiliate of Workers, stops Jake and the rest of Big Deal as they are headed to confront Workers. The current generation of Big Deal members reveal that he is still renown for outsmarted Gun and Goo back when he was still a member. Samuel and Jake engage in witty banter as Samuel suggests they abandon their ideology of passion and join Workers and tells Jake to start working smarter rather than harder. The two continue to converse casually as they engage in a violent exchange of fists. Samuel claims that it is ridiculous to even consider attacking Workers, as that will only help Gun. He then asserts that the Big Four Crews were created as a means to an end, simply to provide the funds for someone's business. Now that someone wants the crews to disappear as they have begun to attract too much attention to themselves, mostly due to Daniel's movements against the crews. Samuel postulates that Gun has received an order to wipe out the crews, especially Workers, since they are aware of the only weakness of "that mysterious person", presumably Charles Choi. Samuel Seo then offers an alliance with Big Deal. Jake then moves towards the car, asserting that he should finally be able to meet the elusive head of Workers if he is here to form an alliance, and the shadowed face of the head is revealed within the car as Jake Kim peers through the open window.
Daniel Park is doing better for himself as he has continued to stream with Kwitch. His self-esteem is higher and his living conditions have improved. As he is streaming within his home, he absentmindedly asks his viewers if they have heard anything about the four major something, eluding to the Big Four Crews. As he ponders when he will finally get rid of the crews, the Chairman of H Group, Jay's dad, and his subordinates approach his neighborhood.
Episode 319
Jake Kim announces to Big Deal that he is forming an alliance with the Workers. He tells them that they need to ally with the Workers in order to defeat Gun, but he hides the fact that Sinu did not betray Big Deal. He changes into a new outfit to infiltrate the Workers by himself.
Daniel tells Steve Hong that Gun and Goo are the two responsible for forming the four major crews, and that the four crews are comprised of minors. Hong offers Daniel an alliance to defeat the crews by offering him money, but Daniel is skeptical and refuses him. Then Hong offers him the chance to change his life, and the location of the third affiliate: Club Vivi. Daniel dresses up using Jay's clothing to enter the club, but he is rejected due to his looks. As he sits with the other rejected members of the club, they see Xialong carrying Vivi into the club, with the guards bowing before them. Daniel recognizes that the guards are wearing gold badges of the Workers. He returns to tell Hong that he was blocked from entering due to discrimination. Hong tells Sophia to make Daniel lose 90lbs by any means possible.
Tom Lee enters a bar to speak with the chairman of Workers, who is calling from a cell phone elsewhere. The chairman tells him to send his men back to the Workers, and Tom says his company only works for payment, mentioning Choi's offer of a new building. The chairman offers him even more money than Choi, so Tom decides to send an intern (Johan Seong) to the third affiliate.
