Summary
Eli and Olly continue their fight on the roof. Goo asks Gun in a different location why he favored Eli, and he mentions his reckless and wild behavior. As Olly and Eli are equally matched, Olly reflects on why he wanted to see Eli; because Eli is the first person who made him feel fear. Olly has had to pretend to feel emotions for most of his life do to his condition. But now he does not feel it, because Eli is stronger than him.
Warren, Max and Derrick and Sally appear and Olly beats them all except for Sally. He asks her why he is unable to feel anything, and tries to hit her but Warren protects her. Olly sees Heather in Sally and realizes that what he felt wasn't fear of Eli, but guilt for what he had done to Heather. He becomes overwhelmed with grief and jumps off the roof to kill himself.
