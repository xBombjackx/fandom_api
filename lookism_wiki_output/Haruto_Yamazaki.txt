Shintaro Yamazaki
, and the cousin of
Gun Park
.
Appearance
TBA
Personality
Unlike his father and most of the Yamazaki Clan members, Haruto didn't believe in bullying the weak, because he thought it was akin to hurting oneself.  As shown during Gun's flashback, Haruto was perhaps the only positive influence in his childhood, and unlike his father and Gun’s mother, encouraged him to have his own thoughts and make his own choices instead of just following their expectations for him. Gun acknowledged that the time he spent with Haruto was the only enjoyable part of his childhood.
Haruto was highly intelligent and administrative-savvy, so much so that his father and subordinates acknowledged that Haruto was more capable of becoming the next Yamazaki Clan leader, despite being a staunch believer in the clan’s traditions; therefore he deemed it as improper for Haruto to be the next head.
Relationships
Gun Park
Haruto's younger cousin, he dissuaded Gun from bullying the weak, his desire to have the heir not hurt anyone dissuading Gun from becoming the Yamazaki Clan Leader.
