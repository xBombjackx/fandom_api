“
Take Pride in Yourself. That is Something I Realized Far too Late.
”
— Gongseob Ji,
Ep. 424
Gongseob Ji
is a monk and the King of Daegu and a predecessor of
Zack Lee
.
Appearance
Gongseob is a tall, bulky man with pale skin and black hair. His hair is styled into a buzz cut and paired with a short beard. The lobes of his ears are stretched, which conforms to his image as a Buddhist monk, and his eyes are typically closed in a smiling expression.
He dons the clothing of a Korean Buddhist monk, having draped an orange garment over clothes of pale grey. He also wears a Rolex watch, expensive sneakers, and glasses with black frames. A greyish pendant shaped like a Christian cross hangs from a cord around his neck, and he is often seen carrying a moktak in hands, tapping it as a monk would.
The long fabric of Gongseob's religious habit hides his missing right leg, which has been replaced with a prosthetic that appears to be made of a shiny grey metal

.
In a recollection of his past as a king of the first generation, Gongseob had a slimmer build and a clean-shaven face. His head was not shorn, but had hair braided into cornrows, and his ears were pierced. He wore a ring on each pointer finger, and glasses of a design similar to his current ones.
Personality
Gongseob Ji is seemingly religious, crying out to the Buddha as a means of calming himself and claiming to have "left the secular world"

behind. However, it is revealed that he actively participates in the secular, partying with several women at a time

and partaking in strong drink on multiple occasions. There is at least one instance exhibited where he became so inebriated that he began playing his moktak with a bottle of alcohol

. To further disprove his supposed position of monk, Gongseob adorns himself in riches, possessing a varied collection of expensive brand items. He does not engage in any religious practices of significance, being shown to neither devote his time to prayer, nor cleaning his prayer area as a true monk would.
Relationships
Taesoo Ma
Friendly rivalry as they have nicknames for each other and fought a lot in the past (with no stated winner).
DG
Resents him greatly as James dropped a building on him.
Zack Lee
Scammed him at the beginning, but had a change of heart and actually started training him.
Synopsis
Background
Like any other 1st Generation King, he was defeated by James Lee, who also took his leg in the process.
Fighting Prowess
During the First Generation, Gongseob Ji ruled over Daegu, the home of Boxing. His unorthodox style of boxing- the "Boxing of Iron", mainly emphasized on speed and endurance. He was stated to be the fastest in that realm, until he was defeated by James Lee.
After his defeat, he was left with only one leg. Moving around was already a huge inconvenience, considering how his fighting style stemmed from the use of his legs.
As a result, he created a new skill: One Step, One Kill.
One Step, One Kill
Utilising his disadvantage to only be able to take a single step, Gongseob uses this to his advantage to pivot his body and land a devastating counterpunch from any angle. This personifies his moniker: the "Iron Fortress"- a fortress that cannot be approached.
