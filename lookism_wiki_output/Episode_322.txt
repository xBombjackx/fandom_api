Summary
Xiaolong responds to Jake in Korean asking if he would step inside, and he is dissapointed he didn't get a chance to fight. When he enters the room a chicken foot is thrown at the wall by Vivi, who is angry that Xiaolong sent an unattractive guard to her. Jake realizes that they mistook him for someone else and decides to play the role, introducing himself as a member of the White Tiger Company. He fakes details about Tom Lee's life and says he thought he would have met Sinu Han during his interview, saying that the two of them are lovers. Xiaolong mentions that he is No. 8, and Vivi tells Jake that their love was not meant to be given that the numbers are kept secret. Jake tries sneezing his name and playing a song about Sinu, but they are interrupted when Johan arrives and introduces himself as the intern from White Tiger Company.
Vasco continues to fight the guards, breaking one of their legs with Brekdak's Forbidden Move No. 6. Johan recognizes Jake, and he attempts to leave but Xiaolong stabs the wall with his scimitar. Brekdak enters the club wondering what is taking Vasco so long.
