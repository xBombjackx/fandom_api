Background
As the daughter of the HNH Group Chairman,
Charles Choi
, Crystal comes from a very wealthy background. However this was not always the case. Crystal seems to have grown up poor for majority of her life, before her father made his business successful. This is implied when she tells Daniel that she used to live under similar conditions as him, as well as looking into her father's own background. She is one of the few raised by the chairman of HNH Group,
Charles Choi
, as well as the only legitimate child and daughter. Crystal (much like Daniel) also has two bodies.
At some point, her father tasked her with keeping an eye on Daniel, which is why she transferred to Jae Won High in her alternate body while her original body is usually attending to her other issues after dusk, usually tending to business related issues.
