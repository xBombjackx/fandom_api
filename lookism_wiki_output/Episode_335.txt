Summary
Vasco managed to avoid being burned, and the fire alarms have been turned on. In the wet, Vasco, Eli and Big Deal try to fend off the Bicheon gang, but they keep rising back up. Jerry grabs Lineman by the head and clears a path for Jake. Lineman pulls down a grate to block the horde.
The three of them face Xiaolong. Vivi breaks open the door and yells at Xiaolong for locking her inside, but he tells her to stay there and closes the door again, locking it with his spear. He tells Jake he will have to kill him if he wants to enter the door. Jake tells Xiaolong he isn’t protecting Vivi simply out of loyalty, and the flashback begins.
Xiaolong was among 108 unregistered Chinese children. He participated in a brutal match where he had to slaughter his fellow brothers in order to be recognized by Vivi’s father. He took him in as a guard to watch over Vivi. Xiaolong throws away Lineman and knocks Jerry into the ground.
Xiaolong says that Big Deal have already failed since their reinforcements are coming (Johan). Johan makes his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel. Samuel asks Johan why he’s working with the third affiliate when they’re responsible for the Punsang cult.
