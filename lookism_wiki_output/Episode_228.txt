Summary
Daniel and Zack are finished beating the uncles and are about to list their demands when the uncles tell them they called for reinforcements. They look back in fear but nobody is present, surprising the uncles. Elsewhere, Vin, Mary,
Logan
and the
Burn Knuckles
are engaged in fighting Hostel separately, preventing them from coming to the aid of the uncles.
Johan asks Olly where Gun is and Olly taunts him about his mother's eyes, causing Johan to attack him. Olly takes the kick well asks if Johan will be okay, at which Johan flips him using aikido he copied from
Gun.
He asks Olly if he will be okay wearing the fake 'H' symbol on his head, seeing as he isn't the real leader of Hostel. Before Olly can speak they are interrupted by
Jin Jang
, who wants to speak with them.
Johan rushes towards Jin but is stopped by
Jerry Kwon
, who says he can't attack him anymore because Jin belongs to Big Deal. Johan decides to attack Jerry instead, asking if he wants another scar on his face. Jerry gets mad and warns Olly and Johan that if they keep provoking him he won't hesitate to kill them.
