Personality
Along with Vasco, Jace had great admiration for super heroes. During middle school, Jace had distanced himself from Vasco because he wasn't as loyal to him.
After he realized his mistake, he became a very loyal friend. He was so loyal that he got himself tattooed to cover Vasco's scars and remove his fear of sharp objects.
He is also smart, considering that he is the brains behind the Burn Knuckles.

While he has not participated in many fights Jace Park is a very skilled fighter. It was stated in chapter 252 he was the only one who kept up with Vasco's workouts. Jace has also shown to fight unfairly and ruthlessly during his fight with a former bully in chapter 57.
