Summary
The God Dogs laugh at Vasco but quickly stop as he destroys them all.
Jin Jang
watches Vasco fight and recognizes him from the photograph as one of Daniel's friends. He fights Vasco and predicts his every move, beating him easily. He says
Johan
will be pleased to know that Vasco came alone.
In a car, Johan is being driven by Gun and Goo after returning from his mother's store. Gun warns him to be careful of Jin because he is known to be a scammer, and that could ruin Johan's chances of being his successor. Johan assures him Jin's scamming days are over, but he is worried about his sadistic tendencies.
Back at the dart place Vasco is severely wounded. Jin prepares to end the fight but he is hit with a low kick out of nowhere. Vasco reveals that he has been training in Muay Thai, and the only reason he didn't use it is because losing is a shameful thing for a student. He stands in preparation for a fight.
