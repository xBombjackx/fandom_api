History
Gapryong Kim
was the most influential member of the
Pre-generation
, and he rallied people around him to create the
Gapryong's Fist
. During this time gangs were called fists, and gang leaders were called bosses.
It is known that Gapryong Fist were at all-out war with the
Yamazaki Syndicate
.
Gapryong and his organisation are told to have rallied the whole criminal underworld during this time, amassing a net worth as high as Seoul's budget. (according to Google, 41.85 trillion Won, or $35.12 billion USD)
Gapryong's organization led the pre-generation for a while until he decided to enter politics, despite being unsuccessful. His followers began fighting each other out of greed, which led to the beginnings of the
1st generation
.

About the
"Gapryong Kim's fist gang"
it is said in chapter 411 that "Each member had a different goal, but they united under the banner of the fist gang to fight against a
"great power".
It is not known what things were like before the
pre-generation
, it is most likely that the
"Great Power"
had a lot of presence in those times. Most likely, there was no one who could stand up to him. Perhaps the gangs of those times were not called "Fists" and their leaders would not be called "Bosses" (although the latter can be questioned for obvious reasons).
It was recently revealed in chapter 502 that the time of Generation 0 was a battle of countries, Korea against Japan, the former being known as Japan's
"great power"
and Korea's greatest enemy, the leader of the Yamazaki Clan, as well as the father of Gun Park,
Shingen Yamazaki
.

Gapryong's line about Gun Park's father having "chosen his death" implies something akin to that of a tragedy for Shingen may have happened during their great fight. This is also faintly supported by Shingen's line about "I'm not going to miss the next time" and "It's all in the past now".

Gun Park's Father
In Generation 0, it is known from
Jichang
that there was a feud between
Jinyoung Park
and
Elite/Charles Choi
. The reason why they hated each other is unknown at the moment.
The identity of the
Generation 0
Bosses is unknown, we only know one Boss and that is
Gapryong Kim
, it is known that he was the strongest of them as he was the Legend of his Generation.
Theories:
As to whether or not there was a Boss in Seoul, there is no doubt that in the
First Generation
there was no Boss in Seoul. The reason is simple and it is because the place was dominated by
Jichang
(the former King of Seoul) and later by the eldest son of Gapryong Kim (the current King of Seoul). It is unlikely that Bosses and Kings shared their territories.
James Lee
states that the
pre-generation
was a generation of people united around Gapryong Kim. He also confirms to us that undoubtedly, all the "Fists" and "Bosses" were comrades of
Gapryong Kim
. All of them must have had the same goal of facing a
"very great power".
Perhaps, the pre-generation began with various gangs and leaders.  But Gapryong's gang would be known as "Fist" and he would be the Boss.  He would then begin to confront and defeat the disunited gangs, it could be said that he would unify the Korean gangs.  Along the way, he would earn several comrades by defeating rival gangs.  Possibly Jinyoung Park, Tom Lee and Elite used to be leaders of those gangs OR they were already Fists of Gapryong Kim from the start.  In this way, Gapryong Kim would unite most of the Korean gangs that were disunited.
There are reasons why a Boss will stop dominating a place. First, this Bosses retired like
Gapryong Kim
would to do something else, which would be normal considering how much time has passed. Second, the Bosses that participated in the
First Generation
stopped dominating their corresponding zone because they would be defeated and replaced by some King. This last option should be the least likely, but it would not be impossible considering factors such as age. In addition to that it is not known what level those Bosses are at and there is a possibility that they are at the level of the Kings or a little higher, both in the pre-generation and in the first generation (where they would be weaker due to age).
"Very Great Power" Theories
1- That
"very great power"
could be the Yakuza itself, the reasons to believe that it was the yakuza is because in real life there was a "gangster" named Kim Du-Han, he grew up as a beggar due to the death of his parents and he became involved with a local gang called the Jumok ("fist"). Kim Du-Han faced the yakuza, becoming a symbol of the resistance of the Koreans against the Japanese. Kim Du-Han was a major figure in the movement against colonial rule and later became a politician. If it came to be true, that would mean that the reason Gun sided with Charles Choi would be to kill Gapryong Kim (who would be the Kim Du-Han of this universe) for having been an enemy of the Yakuza in his time.
The error of this last theory would be to see how in lookism Koreans hate Gapryong Kim for his past as a gang member, being the reason why he failed to be a politician unlike Kim Du-Han.
