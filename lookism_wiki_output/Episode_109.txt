Summary
Crystal's dad explains that he owns a lot of shares in the company and has the right to oust him as the boss. When the boss complains that he doesn't have enough shares, DG informs him that he used his shares to vote in favor of Crystal's dad. They kick him out as boss and cover up the scandal.
Goo is happy to see that Vasco remembers him. Vasco asks him how to get stronger and he doubles the BS workout he gave before. He offers Vasco a position as successor and he refuses because Goo is a thug.
At school the kids ask Daniel about the scandal but he refuses to tell. Oliver debuted and Lasol is still in Class A. Duke made it to Class B.
