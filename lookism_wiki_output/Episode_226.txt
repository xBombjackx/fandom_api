Summary
Vasco saves Hilarious and Like What from getting robbed and has amassed a large following of homeless people into his homeless fam. He meets Warren Chae and
Sally Park
and asks if they are Hostel. When they reveal that they are, he begins wrestling Warren.
Daniel is getting overwhelmed from his fight with the hostel uncles. They are desperate to win and prove that their methods are valid, because Olly Wang respects their fighting style. He is spared when Zack whacks the uncles with a bag of cellphones he stole from James Gong. He asks Daniel to fight alongside him and follow his lead closely.
