Summary
Samuel
admits that he is a member of the
Workers
, which stands for “The Union of One Hundred Billion Dollars”, and that their goal is to make that amount. He asks
Daniel
if there is a problem, and Daniel has no response. Samuel gives him an interview and says he wants Daniel to work with them since he is great at building an audience. Daniel tells
Doo
that he is going to the J Star convention where big streamers meet, and Doo tells Daniel he owes him something.
Like What
and
Hilarious
look around in awe at the convention, and then race to the table of the top five Kwitch streamers, the “Royal Five”. One of the five members,
a girl wearing a red panda suit
, tells them not to trust the company too much. Daniel comes into the building and greets the two girls, but they don’t recognize his fat body.
Samuel looks at some pictures of Daniel and wonders if he will cause trouble to the Workers. Daniel asks to see what is in the room and Samuel tells him not to interrupt, and then goes to the bathroom. Daniel tests the voice recognition of the door but it doesn’t work. Then he pulls out the ONE MCN card
Gun
gave him and the door unlocks.
