Xiaolong was asked to be Vivi's father's bodyguard, but he decided to stay with Vivi instead.
Xiaolong recruited many of the other members into the Bicheon Gang. Huseong Ha's gang was bought monetarily. Taegon Wi, Hwang Ho and Sowol Jin were scouted personally for their talent. Xiaolong also helped train much of the later Bicheon gang, the majority of whom were victims from a large fire.

The Bicheon Gang has an intense hierarchy system. Children must fight to prove themselves capable of joining (the fate of the losers is unknown). None of their members are allowed to have names: instead they have numbers. The Cheon gang are the highest ranks of the Bicheon gang, and they are taught the secret
