Summary
Daniel
tells
the president
that he wants a tour and wants

as his tour guide. Daniel asks Mr. Kim where they locked the minor streamers and Mr.Kim says he doesn't know what he's talking about. This causes the other members of
Workers
to laugh as well, and Daniel asks where
Samuel Seo's
office is.
