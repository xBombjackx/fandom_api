Conviction Users
Don't know if this is a new type of Mastery or not?
Put the will to protect others into that punch, the power that is used to protect someone, call is Overcome

"Despair" Users
Contrary to
conviction
,
we have lost everything, everything we cherish
or
simply spread fear to others
. Or it can be said more simply, the power carried by faith is fading, because there is nothing to protect.
This is not very certain, so let's just leave it here for now.
