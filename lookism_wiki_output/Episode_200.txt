Summary
The God Dogs begin looking for the Burn Knuckles, and spray paint students who are cleared. Damon Goh of Burn Knuckles spots them and orders them to stop, but the God Dogs laugh at him.
Vin and Mary are hanging out a karaoke place when they are approached by Ivan Park. Vin insults Ivan by saying he hates ugly people, and Ivan states they will get along just fine since he hates handsome ones. Vin attacks Ivan but Ivan flips away and smashes Vin into the claw machine. He tries to take off Vin's glasses using the machine but stops when Mary smashes the lights off. Vin gets up under the cover of the darkness and prepares to fight.
