Synopsis
Club Arc
Johan is standing outside by himself when Sowol Jin asks him where his partner is. When he tells her bluntly, she says she doesn't like his attitude towards an executive member of Workers. She tries to hit him but he flips her and catches her. She is embarassed and says that she will tell someone about this.
All of Daniel's expenditures have caught Vivi's attention, and Sowol is asked to bring Daniel to come to the president.
When Tiktaktok girl tries to escape Vivi's club, Sowol tells her that she isn't allowed to leave because she might report them, and forces her to eat the drugged cookies as well.
Workers (3 Affiliates)
Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers. Johan makes his way to Vivi’s room with Sowol when they run into Samuel, who tells him that the Workers are responsible for the Pungsan cult. Sowol is confused what Pungsan has to do with Johan, but he tells her to spill the beans or he will kill everyone. She is later seen cowering after Johan beat up all of her men, but he did not hit her.
