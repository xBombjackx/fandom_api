Jasmine is waiting for James at her runaway fam house when Zack barges in looking for her. He is quick to accuse her of using Mira and she denies it and starts crying. James appears with the cell phones and greets Zack warmly, but Zack knocks him out and takes the phones from him.
As Daniel fights the uncles they realize he is unnaturally talented and strong. It is revealed that they auditioned to enter Big Deal but were denied by Jake because they fight dirty. They decide to take on Daniel with power equal to the head of a crew.
