Summary
Zack
and

ask
Daniel
why he disappeared with the Workers, and he is saved by
Zoe
telling him the teacher wants to see him. The teacher tells him that a student will come to the class, and it may cause issues in the class.
Hostel
ask
Justin Peng
and
Chuck Kwak
why they let Workers get away with using
Olly's name
for their meeting. Justin and Chuck apologize to Hostel for saying it was their fault Olly died, and that they run illegal errands for
the Workers
now. They wanted to meet with Hostel because they suspect that Olly Wang died partly because of the pills he was taking, pills they suspect came from the Workers. They offer to work as double agents to fill Hostel in on what is going on inside the Workers.
At Gangseo,
Jake
tells the highest members of

to not mess with Workers, and to relay that to the lower members.
Brad
asks Jake why they would work with such an immoral organization, and he apologizes for being a bad leader.
Jerry

At the school, Zoe and
Mira
ask Daniel why the teacher wanted to see him. Just then
the teacher
announces that a student will be coming in the class, that student being
Jiho Park
. He is on leave because his grandmother died, and he wanted to apologize to Daniel during his break.
