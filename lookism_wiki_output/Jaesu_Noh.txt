Jaesu Noh
is a secondary character, a member of Team Shin Sera in the White Tiger Job Center
Appearance
In the single panel we've seen of his past, his mullet was much longer, and he was very well-built.
Jaesu is a shorter man with black hair in a short mullet. He wears a green cap with a yellow logo, a brown plaid collared shirt, a blue jacket with the plaid pattern on the breasts, dark pants, and a pair of low-top blue shoes with white soles (Possible slippers).
Personality
Jaesu's personality hasn't been shown too much, given his quick introduction and defeat.
Relationships
Tom Lee
Both seem to know each other well, with Jaesu being part of Tom's organization, in addition to having already fought together in the Gapryong Fist.
Synopsis
Workers (1st Affiliate)
Jaesu appears with Team Sera Shin to defeat the Allied members in the 1st affiliate, slamming
Jerry Kwon
into the ground. However, this soon proves to be a bad match-up as Jerry gets back up and lifts Jaesu into the air with one hand, choking him out before he gets slammed into the ground, knocking him out of the fight.
Fighting Prowess
Jaesu Noh is someone considerably strong, taking into account that he is a member of the 0th Generation.
He's a typical strongman who's wrestled dozens of bulls. His one weakness is his bad luck.
