NEVER BITES BUDDY
God Dog
was one of the
Four Major Crews
. They resided in Gangbuk, north of the Han River. Their leader and only remaining member is
Johan Seong
.
History
God Dog was made from a collection of various crews Johan managed to defeat in the Gangbuk region. After gathering enough members, Johan barged onto the largest crew,
K House
, and took it over by beating their leader
Jin Jang
. Johan had their name changed and thus created a new gang God Dog.
Johan maintained his leadership through fear and intimidation and would do most of the gang's dirty work.
Jin Jang
would become second in command and was responsible for collecting the money and maintaining the headcount of the God Dogs. Johan stopped the gang from earning money through scams, as illegal activity would ruin his chances as
Gun
's successor. However, they didn't care for his input and simply moved their operations to Central Seoul behind Johan's back. Eventually, they betrayed Johan in favor of Jin Jang's leadership, and he was disqualified as a candidate to be Gun's successor.
Since then, most former members returned to
K House
, some tried joining Big Deal and some joined
Hostel
A. Eventually, all of them would be absorbed into
Workers
under
Samuel Seo
's Fourth Affiliate. Johan Seong still calls himself a God Dog, although some say that he was the only God Dog there ever was because he was the only one who believed in his ideals.
Organization
Jin Jang
was the second in command, and his responsibility was organizing the God Dogs. His four subordinates called "Old Boys" (OB) were the elite members of the gang:
Dominic Min
,
Scott Kwon
,
Hope Park
, and
Ivan Park
. There was no other hierarchy involved.

Trivia
The old name of God Dog was teased multiple times in the story but was revealed a lot later
The logo of God Dogs contained images of a dog, cross and 666. The name is also an anagram. It may have been chosen as a reference to Johan's experience in a satanic cult named
Pungsan
.
