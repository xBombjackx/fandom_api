Summary
Olly accepts James as an uncle but he refuses, saying he wants to be in Moley's family. Olly is okay with this until he realizes James stole all his cellphones. He orders Moley to go find James and leaves on his motorbike.
The uncles get the FR report on their phones and Daniel approaches them. He finds out FR actually means 'Fake Report', and the uncles are there to beat him. Chuck attacks Daniel and he struggles to keep up with his dirty way of fighting. He manages to copy Chuck's counter, startling the duo. Daniel realizes he fights too predictably and decides to fight like Gun.
