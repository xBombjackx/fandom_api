FOR THE BIG DEAL WAY
Big Deal
were members of the
Four Major Crews
. They reside in Gangseo, west of the Han River. They are led by
Jake Kim
.
History
Big Deal is a gang with history in Gangseo. Not much is known about their origins except that they have been there for a while. Sinu Han took over the gang as a child and made some adjustments to the gang's belief system to make life easier for the girls who lived on that street.
When Jake Kim was third in command he was in a dispute with the leader of Big Deal, Sinu Han, who chose to sell Big Deal to the Workers for extra money. Jake decided against it, and won the favor of the rest of Big Deal. Since then, he has been the leader of Big Deal. His caring demeanor to his subordinates makes Big Deal one of the most loyal out of the 4 big crews. Only later did Jake learn that Sinu Han did not mean to sell Big Deal, but decided to sell himself to the Workers instead. Since then, Jake has worked hard to bring Sinu back from the Workers and fulfill Gun's requirements to be a potential successor.
Organization
Big Deal's organization is a number system, with a lower number being more important. Jake Kim used to be the leader of the YB branch, but since then Big Deal has dissolved into one large association. The previous No.1
Big Boss
and No. 2
Old Face
have been removed when Big Deal made Jake Kim their leader. After the dissolution of
God Dog
, the remaining members under Jin Jang joined Big Deal. Since then however, they have abandoned the crew to join the
Workers
.
Big Deal is the most romantic of the four crews. They do not fight dirty, and they don't accept people who do so.

, but he did not end up joining the crew.
