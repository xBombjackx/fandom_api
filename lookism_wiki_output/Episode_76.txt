Summary
Daniel is disgusted by how the men view the women as sources of money. He is uncomfortable in the adult setting and tries to play cool but one of the women there, Jessy, falls for him. She tries to woo him with gifts but he refuses, because Jay already gave him a lot. He does ask for a rice cooker, and when he takes a drink to cool his nerves he gets drunk from the alcohol.
The other guys believe Daniel is trying to steal their customer and decides to discipline him. Daniel is inebriated, and becomes cocky in his drunkenness.
