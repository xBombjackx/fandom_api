Summary
The priest unlocked the cage Mira was inside and dragged her by the hair into the warehouse. The main worshipper took Zack and Johan out of the cages with their hands tied to watch the sacrifice up close. The disciples gathered around Johan's mother with stones and began chucking them at her, but before any rock landed on her, Johan directed the rocks away from his mother with quick jabs he learned from Zack.
Johan's hands were pouring out blood and it was revealed he got out of his handmade handcuffs by repeatedly grinding it against his skin peeling it in the process in order to slip out of them. Zack is not surprised by Johan's skill, because he was always jealous of Johan's boxing skill.
