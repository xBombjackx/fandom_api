Synopsis
Fake Bank Account
James Gong is introduced after
Jiho
goes to the ATM and smokes while sitting down on the Bank Withdrawal.
He then spots Jiho walking outside as soon as possible before he immediately recognizes him after Jiho forgot to get his withdrawn money back as James takes it and thought that Ji Ho himself had gotten money for him.
He only wanted to be friends with Jiho only to borrow money from his account,
He later spots James and his friends outside a bar, asking Jiho if he wanted to drink beer.
Jiho creates a bank account for him as a gift, which James then sells to pay debt, which leads to the account being used for scamming.
After the Bank Fiasco, James as well as
Daniel
got pushed from the 5-story building from Jiho, because of his jealousy for Daniel, and for his anger that James wouldn't pay him back.
Runaway Fam Arc
James is later seen hanging around with The Mole Family, the one Daniel saw before. Sammy and Gerry began a 'reform stream', where they were going to turn criminals for good. The camera fell and it is implied by the punching that the stream failed. James then steals the camera and their car, plus a claw machine with dolls in it.
Soon later, he then stole food from a funeral home along with a commission box. Jasmine however managed to get him away unsuspected. Later, he and The Mole went to the building where the main Uncles and Big Daddy was. He however ignored any sign of precaution and honked until
Olly Wang
jumped and attacked him. James was then assumed to sign for the 3rd Uncle and was set to fight Chuck Kwak and won with tactics and a brick. James then earned the role though was unaware of it and was offered a phone. However James decided to steal all the phones and drive away. He then met
Zack Lee
once again though he was punched in the face and got his cigarette stolen. He finally returned in a bus enraged by Zack to the point where he wants to kill him. He tried to drive Zack over but that failed due to Daniel shoving Zack out of the way and
Jay
saving Daniel. James then tried to smash Zack's head in with the sledgehammer but failed due to Jay using a helmet to protect his head and then using it on James' head and hitting it multiple times. James then gave up and drove away, not before telling Zack that he promises to kill him.
Fighting Prowess
James does not have a specific martial art ability, but has shown to impress Hostel leader Olly Wang through his "creativity." He has often used cheap tricks to win a fight as using nearby weapons to surprise his opponents. James also has impressive strength as shown when he was able to knock back Hostel Uncle Chuck Kwak a considerable distance with his left hand (specifically his middle finger). James finally displays an unnatural endurance given his ability to survive beatings from Jay and Zack Lee while getting up.
