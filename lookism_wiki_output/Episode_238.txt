Summary
Warren beats Olly for hitting his parents, and is disgusted by his behavior. Olly asks why Warren cannot empathize with him, because he only robbed his house to help them. He explains that he feels trapped at home and wishes he had the freedom they had, even saying he wishes he was an orphan. Eli tells Olly that he understands him, but he needs to return home.
Olly is desperate to earn Eli's approval back. He begins robbing minors using Heather's photograph. He shows the money to Eli, but Eli is upset. He asks why Olly wants to be like him, when he has lived such a sad life. Olly disagrees with Eli, saying that his hardships are worth becoming as cool as Eli is. They are interrupted by Darius Hong, who mistakes Eli for Warren and gets too close to his face. Eli punches Darius and is horrified to see not only did it do no damage, Darius seemed to enjoy it.
At the building Warren, Heather and Sally are surrounded by members of Backdoor. Warren tells the girls to close there eyes as he prepares to fight.
