Summary
DG
confiscates the cookies from
Daniel
and is too fast for him to take them back. He feels Daniel up and recognizes that he is Daniel Park. Daniel is surprised because he hasn't met him in the little body. DG asks Daniel if his secret move was taught by
Sophia Alexander
. DG eventually decides to give the cookies back to Daniel because he intends to meet
Steve Hong
himself. He also gives Daniel his phone number and tells him that he will share any secret he wants to know. Daniel returns the cookies to Steve Hong, who is disappointed. Steve tells him that he won't reveal this to the public, because
Vivi
is the daughter of the chairman of T Group. He tells Daniel not to waste his money, because he will need it for the second affiliate.
Vivi and
Xiaolong
are living in rural China where
Goo
dropped them off. Vivi tells Xiaolong that if they keep a low profile, eventually her father will approve of their relationship. They say they love each other, and Xiaolong asks for Vivi to fetch him a blanket. Waiting for him is one of T Group's Cheon guards, Jiou Jeon, who takes Xiaolong away while stating there is no way for the two of them to be together. Vivi returns to find him gone.
Zoe
tells Daniel that he looks similar to his second body now that his baby fat is gone. They are interrupted by
Arin
who is now a Kwitch streamer. Zoe is jealous and calls Daniel a player.
Back at the hotel,
Eli
tells
Sally
that Xiaolong and Vivi were in love with each other, and she feels envious of their romance.
Warren
sneaks up on her with his ninja skills he learned from
Manager Kim
. Warren tells Eli that he brought a letter addressed to him. In the letter,
Olly Wang
invites everyone in Hostel.
