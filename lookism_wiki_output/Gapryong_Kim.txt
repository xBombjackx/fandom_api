“
I mean, from a woman's perspective, Gapryong was the worst piece of shit ever... but he could be never pass by someone in need or ignore any kind of injustice.
”
— Minseon Kang about Gapryong,
Ep. 311
Gapryong Kim
is the father of two distant children and presumably more, including
Jake Kim
and
Kitae Kim
, and is the boss of Gapryong's Fist. He left the fist to pursue politics, an endeavor he never succeeded in before he died. He is the most influential member of the Pre-Generation.
Appearance
Gapryong Kim possessed an exceptionally imposing and well-developed physique, characterized by a powerful and athletic build. His musculature was highly defined, with broad shoulders, a wide chest, and a pronounced V-taper created by an expansive back and a narrow waist. The structure of his back muscles was particularly remarkable — densely layered and deeply contoured, suggesting not only years of physical conditioning but also extensive real-world combat experience. His arms were thick and muscular, with visible vascularity and strength-oriented development, indicating both raw power and practical functionality. He was frequently depicted wearing gloves, underscoring his association with hand-to-hand combat and further reinforcing his image as a physical enforcer. Even in formal attire, his strength remained apparent — tailored suits clung to a frame built not for show, but for dominance and resilience. Facially, Gapryong Kim bore sharp, chiseled features and a commanding expression that exuded confidence and authority. His eldest son, Kitae, is noted to be a direct reflection of Gapryong in his prime, while Jake Kim is said to resemble his father almost identically during his younger years.
Personality
He was playful, loyal, and protective of the weak. However, he was very flirtatious and had many children besides Jake Kim, leading to resentment from his partners. Gapryong's personality was a blend of stoicism, charisma, and a deep sense of justice. He was known to be reserved yet commanding, often inspiring loyalty without demanding it. His actions were guided by a strong moral compass, and he was willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. As much as Kim Gapryong is seen as a person who does not tolerate no kind of injustice, proving his kindness. According to
Minseon Kang
, When she was talking to
Jake Kim
, She claimed that Gapryong had two sides, a good and a bad one, when she was referring to both her son Jake, and his son who represented his evil side,
Kitae Kim
. In other words, even though gapryong is a fair and kind person, he probably has a perverse personality like Kitae's, which has not yet been introduced. Analyses of Gapryong Kim's character suggest he aligns with the ISTJ personality type, characterized by a strong sense of duty, practicality, and reliability. This assessment reflects his methodical approach to leadership and his unwavering commitment to his principles.
Synopsis
Backstory
He was a renowned criminal who worked with three of his closest members. However, after accomplishing a goal, he gave up being a mobster and sought to enter politics, but he kept failing until he passed away. The rest of his men broke away, formed their own crews, and started fighting one another. Gapryong Kim was a legendary figure in the Korean underworld and the central force behind the Pre-Generation, also known as the 0th Generation. Revered for his unmatched strength and feared leadership, he unified Korea's criminal world under his rule during his peak, which is estimated to have occurred around 25 to 30 years before the main events of
Lookism
. This timeline is supported by the ages of his sons—Kitae Kim, the eldest at 27, and Jake Kim, the youngest at 19—suggesting that Gapryong's dominance took place in the late 1990s or early 2000s. In Chapter 556, it is stated that he amassed a fortune “almost as much as the entire budget of Seoul city at the time,” placing his estimated net worth in the multi-billion dollar range, a staggering sum that reflected the scale of his control over the criminal world. Although he later failed in his attempt to enter politics, there is no indication that he lost his fortune entirely; in fact, the luxurious lifestyle maintained by Jake Kim and Minseon Kang after his death—including residence in a large mansion—suggests that a significant portion of his wealth may have remained intact or been hidden. His legacy continues to shape the present narrative, particularly through Jake Kim, who carries the weight of his father’s name and influence. Gapryong Kim's legendary status in
Lookism
is further solidified by his confrontation with the Yamazaki Clan, a formidable Yakuza syndicate led by Shingen Yamazaki. This clash occurred during the Pre-Generation era, a time when Gapryong's Fist Gang was at its peak. The Yamazaki Clan, known for their strength and influence, posed a significant threat, but Gapryong's leadership and combat prowess led to their defeat. This victory not only demonstrated his dominance over domestic criminal organizations but also over powerful foreign syndicates. The aftermath of this battle had lasting effects, with Shingen Yamazaki falling into a lethargic state, indicating the profound impact of their encounter. This event underscores Gapryong Kim's unparalleled strength and strategic acumen in the
Lookism
universe.
Fighting Prowess
In
his
fight with
Jichang Kwak
Charles Choi stated that if his hands were his strength, he wouldn't have been the second-in-command of the Oth Generation, which indicated that Gapryong Kim's physical strength was much higher than that of
Elite
. Even so, Elite, who past his prime can beat a 1st Gen king with little to no difficulty.  His level of finesse, combined with his superhumanly articulate body, is beyond what any fighter in the series has achieved in the most simplistic of movements, as stated by
Jinyoung Park
. Gapryong Kim is an arguable candidate for the strongest fighter in the series.Taesoo Ma once mentioned that Gapryong (together with Jake and Kitae) were the only people that could block
invisible attacks
from fighters such as Elite, James Lee and Sinu Han.Not much else is known about the legendary dragon Gapryong Kim before the upcoming Cheonliang arc, even though he was the No.1 of his generation, but he had fighters such as Elite, Jinyoung Park and
Tom Lee
to be under him. "Lightning Choi" once asked Gapryong how he was so strong but all that was answered back was overcome (overcome all obstacles). Also, Gapryong was called a master of his 'powers' and the originator of the legendary Kim's bloodline, stating that Jake and his
brother
have 'Unlimited Potential'. Gapryong's fist power was so powerful that even Jinyoung Park, who got the copy ability and all of the experience from the pre-generation, can only copy up to 3 moves from Gapryong.

Can punch hard. His fighting style is said to be so strong that even Jinyoung Park, who was the first copy user since the 0th Generation, could only manage three strikes at best before being fatigued.
During Jinyoung's fight against Tom in the latest chapter, Jinyoung went into a rage state and accused Tom of killing Gapryong, which Tom heavily denies, citing that there's no reason for him to kill Gapryong.
There are many culprits said to be involved in his murder case. Notable ones include James Lee, Kitae Kim and Charles Choi.
It is likely that Gapryong is based on the real-life figure of
Kim Du-han
.
