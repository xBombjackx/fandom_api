Summary
Aru asked Oliver to sign a contract for marriage if their debuts fail. She learns that a wealthy gangster is willing to invest in a girl group at PTJ. Lasol is considered but not Aru, and she grows despondent.
Oliver is walking when he spies a man kissing Aru in the car. He races to save her and is beaten by that man's bodyguard. The man is the wealthy gangster who wanted to invest. Aru decided to be his girlfriend and in exchange he would make her a famous idol.
Aru cuts Oliver off and the bodyguard becomes her manager. The girl group is discontinued and Oliver and Lasol are stuck in Class C, where Aru intends to keep them. Oliver burns the contract and cries about his misfortune.
