Summary
Johan grabs the old man by the collar and threatens him. The man tells him that their dogs were kidnapped by the cat lady down the street. She was an animal addict and liked to collect animals, but she failed to take care of them and they grew weak and dirty. The old man tried to stop her but he could not legally do so. While Johan and Daniel went to the man she snuck into his room and stole some more animals.
Daniel receives a call from the girl who tells him she saw a woman run off with two dogs. He and Johan race outside and begin searching. Johan calls his gang to help them search for their dogs.
