Invisble Attacks are a rare and unique fighting style that involves attacking the opponent's blindspots with extreme speed and accuracy. This technique is so fast and powerful that people who are not able to comprehend the speed of the attacks, consider them "invisible" to the eye.
The technique is so demanding of speed and accuracy that only 3 people in the History of Fists have been able to properly utilise it. Even Daniel Park was unable to copy this technique.
