Summary
Zack asks if Gun bullied Johan and Johan is too shocked to reply. Zack attacks Gun and Gun is impressed by his speed and determination. He tries to kick Zack but is stopped by Vasco, who carries a muay thai stance. Daniel attacks Gun with his own moves, and Gun realizes Daniel is just as talented as Johan.
He offers a position to Daniel, but he refuses and declares he will destroy the four crews. Vasco agrees to help, and Gun is impressed by Vasco's leadership and Daniel's natural talent. He offers a position to Zack but Zack sticks up his middle finger, claiming he was too emotional when they fought and he wants a rematch. Gun is pleased with their teamwork and leaves them, saying "ganbare". Zack turns to talk to Johan but he has disappeared again. The only sign he was there is his broken wish bracelet in the sand.
In the epilogue, Goo and Gun visit a restaurant. Goo is berating Gun for getting the car seats wet. He is disappointed Gun failed Johan and asks how he can't keep his successors in line. Seonong spills the food on Gun on accident, and Gun prepares to beat him.
Brekdak
races to save Seonong and Gun recognizes him.
