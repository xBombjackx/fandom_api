Fighting Prowess
The King of Pyeongtaek trained his fists, this can be seen by looking at the scars he had on his fist, and his strongest attack is his punch that comes from below. As for his level, he would scale slightly weaker than the King of Suwon, since defeating Seokdu, required the combined effort by the trio of Eli, Samuel, and Warren, while the King of Pyeongtaek was defeated by the duo of Eli and Warren.
