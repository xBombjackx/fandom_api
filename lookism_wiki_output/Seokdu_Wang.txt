—Seokdu Wang  in
episode 408
Seokdu Wang
is the leader of the Suwon Gang, and a member of the
1st Generation
.
Appearance
Seokdu is a tall and muscular young man that wears a blue white-stripped suit, black necktie, and a white polo as inner clothing. He bears a lot of scars on his forehead after all the fights he's been in.
Personality
Seokdu takes pride in his status as a 1st generation king. He seems to care a lot about his comrades and his territory, willing to put a stop to
Eli Jang
,
Warren Chae
, and
Samuel Seo
, by himself from pushing their plan.
He enjoys the thrill of battle, looking forward towards Taesoo's statement that the
2nd Generation
aren't weak as well as complaining to Taesoo as to why "that man", referring to
James Lee
, ended the 1st generation so soon. His love for fighting is shown in his battle with the
Workers
trio, smiling and complimenting their abilities in the heat of battle.
History (optional)
TBA
Relationships
Changyong Ji
Changyong is Seokdu's apprentice, who inherited the
Seokdu Staffing Agency
from Seokdu Wang.
Taesoo Ma
They have a friendly relationship as they were shown twice eating having a meal with each other
Fighting Prowess
He was stated by Eli that he wasn't just any regular 1st gen, but a King that ruled through the generation. His signature attack is his headbutts, and just a regular headbutt from him was damaging cars, cement and walls, also the extremely sturdy Warren and Eli almost died with just one headbutt. That is crazy because Eli Jang survived getting beat up by
Tom Lee
who is much stronger than Seokdu for 1 month and Eli could still stand and fight, but a headbutt almost killed him and made him almost lose the will to fight. Seokdu was fighting evenly with the rapidly growing Eli and Samuel (Who both achieved mastery) and barely lost. His durability is great as well as he took an attack that can kill you from a CQC trained Warren Chae and survived.
Quotes

Trivia
