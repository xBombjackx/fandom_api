Appearance
Jin has dark hair, dark eyes, and thick eyebrows. He has three silver piercings, two above and below his right eyebrow, and one on the right side of his nose.
Personality
Jin Jang is a ruthless individual when he is fighting. He is known to be sadistic in battles and likes to torture his opponents when he is done with them. Despite the way he treats his enemies, he is good leader. The K-House members are loyal towards him and respect his abilities.
Fighting Prowess
Johan said that while he beat Jin, Jin isn't someone to look down on because he can easily detect an opponent's weaknesses. He said that Jin only acts after he's finished an analysis.

In Jin's fight against Vasco, he shows that he can win when he predicts an opponent's moves, yet is weak when not able to analyze beforehand.

Jin Jang also was fully capable of defeating Scott Know with ease once he analyzed his style.
Jin Jang's analysis also proceeds to his strategic planning as he tried to set up Jay and Eli with opponents that would they would be very poor against. Not only did he use this to test their prowess but to also test Jace's intellect. Thus proving that Jin Jang is on the smarter side of the spectrum when it comes to the characters. His analyzation can also be used in a broader sense as during the Hostel arc he was capable of manipulating the J high school group to fight each other without lifting a finger.
