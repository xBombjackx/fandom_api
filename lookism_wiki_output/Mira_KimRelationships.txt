J High School
Zack Lee
It has been revealed that Zack has a crush on her. She seems to be neutral, or even accepting of this, but still acts very shy about it. Zack and Mira care about each other a lot and often spend time with each other. Mira dislikes when Zack fights in public or makes a scene, often pulling him away from the conflict and scolding him for it later.
When the two of them go to the library together later, Zack promises not to fight that day, but ends up getting into a conflict with a group of bullies at the library who decide to pick on him and eat the Honey BBQ chips Zack brought to give to Mira, which are her favorite. He lets it go at the insistence of Mira, but ends up fighting the leader of the group when he gropes Mira.
Mira is a little upset that Zack didn't keep his promise, but later that night in a text she hints that she is happy he defended and protected her and that she forgives him.
Daniel Park
When Daniel first met her in his original body, he thought she was flirting with him when she smiles at him. Actually, she was only trying to apologize for Zack's aggressive behaviour. She is friendly with Daniel in his new body, and is part of the friend group that he hangs out with.
Jasmine Huh
Mira gave Jasmine another chance and is very friendly with her, despite of the fact that she framed Vasco. She tries to help her whenever she can and she is not aware that Jasmine actually uses her and her friendship.
Friend
Johan Seong
Johan is Mira's and Zack's childhood friend. She and Johan attended the same church. Johan also has a crush on Mira. They were tight friends. Mira was upset when Johan slowly distanced himself away from her. She tried to make up for it by visiting his mother and his salon. She also prayed and hoped that they would continue to be close friends.
