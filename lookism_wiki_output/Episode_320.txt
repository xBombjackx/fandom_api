Summary
A rich Chinese girl gets high on LSD, and a cleanup crew covers her tracks to make sure she doesn't get caught in her hotel room.
Outside, Brekdak gives his stand to Vasco to make money, and Vasco sells fish sticks to his costumers. He meets a variety of people, including "Jane Kim," who is Jake in disguise. When the Chinese girl takes food, but doesn't pay the 500 won, Vasco realizes it and tries to go inside the club to get payment.
Jake, who entered the club, sees Old Face and decides to talk to him. Just then, Vasco, who is getting confronted for entering the club without the security guard's permission and is demanding payment, causes a stir and distracts everyone. This causes a fight to break out between him and some of the guards. Ho Hwang challenges Vasco to a fight.
