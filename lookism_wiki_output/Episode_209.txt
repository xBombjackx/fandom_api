Summary
All the guys stand facing each other, not knowing what to do. Vasco states he will punish them all and they begin fighting each other. Johan interrupts the fight by hitting them all, then tells Daniel to join him. He tells Daniel that money is power, and asks if he has something he wants to protect. A large amount of God Dogs appear behind him, and Logan and Vin team up to fight them.
Vasco attacks Johan and Johan counters with Vasco's own kick. He tries to punch Vasco but his fist is caught by Daniel. Daniel rejects Johan's offer and tells him he looks unstable. He explains that power is useless if you lose what you are trying to protect, because that would leave you all alone. Vasco stands by Daniel and the rest of the Burn Knuckles appear to back him up.
Daniel asks Johan to stop the fighting and send his gang home. Johan laughs at Daniel and attacks him, simultaneously holding his friends back. He tells Daniel without power he can't protect anything, and tells his men to fight the Burn Knuckles. He is hit in the head with a baseball bat by Jin and collapses on the floor. Daniel is shocked as the God Dogs laugh that they waited this long just to attack Johan.
