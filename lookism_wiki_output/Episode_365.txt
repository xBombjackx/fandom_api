Summary
Darius is asked what his dream guy would be like, and he says a strong man. When asked about DG he says it isn't possible to feel lust for a god. DG complains that he isn't as strong as he used to be, and leaves after beating up everyone.
Daniel and Hudson are exchanging blows. Hudson grabs his left arm to punch Daniel but he kicks him away. Hudson has a flashback to his master at a bonfire. The king of Ansan says that he will be giving the crew to Hudson, who will be the sun of Ansan. He offers him a roasted python and Hudson accepts his position. Hudson tries to motivate himself against Daniel but he is struggling because Daniel is copying his moves. Daniel kicks Hudson out of a window and slams his face into the ground as they fall. He tells Hudson to return as friends in the future.
Daniel then sees a guy walking towards him. He asks if he is the King of Ansan. DG is also walking in that direction when he notices something.
