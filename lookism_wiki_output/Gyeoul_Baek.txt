We'll bring out your hidden beauty.

— Gyeol Baek,
Ep. 441
Gyeol Baek (백결)
is the president of the
Workers'
first affiliate and a minor antagonist in Lookism.
Appearance
Gyeoul has a tall, muscular physique. He has black hair in a two-block style and wears silver glasses. He is usually seen wearing black pants, a white dress shirt, a black tie, and his doctor's coat. He also wears a ring with the Workers' logo on his right middle finger.
Personality
His morals appear to be questionable since he conducts an unethical business by intentionally ruining clients' faces through surgery. Outside of this, he appears calm and amicable and even laughs at jokes.
Gyeoul's vision of true beauty is incredibly twisted, preferring how a man appeared after a car accident rather than his face after his brother fixed him. He is pointed out as being a hypocrite by Goo since he didn't even touch his own face.
After his brother's accident, he assumed his identity, had his father unjustly imprisoned using Korea's mental health legislature, murdered his mother after taking over her drug administration, and had
Jinyoung Park
force his brother back to life through human experimentation, whereupon Gyeoul would describe his brother's appearance as being beautiful, even surprising Jinyoung.
Goo Kim
, who knows the truth of what Gyeoul did, outright calls him a psychopath.
Relationships
Goo Kim
Goo and Gyeoul are somewhat familiar with each other, as Goo would have Gyeoul handle his shots when he went to the hospital, with Gyeoul believing he had come to help him on the side of the workers when he infiltrated the Grimm Plastic Surgery Clinic.
Eugene
He works with Eugene by way of the Workers' First Affiliate. They met while attending middle school together and Eugene offered to work with him. In the present day, they still seem to be close and occasionally meet up. He seems to be in the same high school as Eugene.
Synopsis
Gyeoul runs a business that used to be his father's plastic surgery office where he now works as the lead doctor. In reality, he takes clients with sponsored contracts that allow him to hire inexperienced surgeons who ruin the clients' faces while the office takes the money. According to him and Eugene, this illegal business is virtually undetectable.
Trivia
Hangyeoul knows several languages: which include Japanese, English, and Chinese.
