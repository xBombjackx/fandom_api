Synopsis
Background
Not much is known about Joy other than the fact that she is the younger sister of
Jay Hong
and
Kitae Hong
. She was first introduced as a model for an agency.
Episode 71
Joy is seen having her makeup put on while she was modelling for the 'Oh Clothing Shop'. When she sees Daniel (in his new body), she becomes completely smitten and gazes at him after he comes out of the van, which angers Beom. When he observes the way she models so that he could get an idea of what to do, Joy becomes flattered and embarrassed.
Episode 72
After watching Daniel in smite and adoration, Joy finally introduces herself to him as his Pacebook friend/follower. She then models with Daniel for 'Kian Clothing Shop' for free since she's a freelancer model. When they wear similarly matching clothes, she states that they look like a couple which Daniel hesitantly agrees with. The coordinator offers to repay her in some way and she states that he could pay for dinner for her and Daniel. During dinner, the three of them eat crab soup. Daniel, since he's only had crab legs in his soup because of the financial struggle his mother went through, gets confused and asks why there's the whole body of a crab in the soup. This confuses both Joy and the coordinator of 'Kian Clothing Shop'. Beom tries to call Joy but she declines him anyway, stating that he's too persistent.

As Daniel quits the company, she also lost interest and quits too. She later enrolled herself on
J High
, just to be with her brother Jay, and she knew Daniel was studying there.
