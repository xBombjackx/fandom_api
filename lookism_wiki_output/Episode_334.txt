Summary
Jake takes Daniel and Tiktaktok girl to a room so they can pretend to be guests, warning them not to leave. Daniel asks the girl to go to sleep, and he tries to turn into his other body but it won’t wake up. Johan notices Sowol packing up the drugs and asks what’s going on. He bumps into one of the workers and is shocked by his disfigured face. Johan asks if they are from the Workers and Sowol says they were brought by the mainland, but are not Workers.
The disfigured men attack Eli and he is surprised how little they care about being damaged. They even injure each other trying to kill him. Elsewhere, Vasco tries to get the badge from Hwang but the henchmen grab him. They are doused with gasoline, and they light a match while holding Vasco. The three musketeers are climbing the elevator when they arrive at a floor filled with the disfigured henchmen. They are even on top of the elevator.
Samuel explains that during the Great Chinese Fire, 103 children were burned. Xiaolong took them in and turned them into warriors to protect Vivi. They are part of the Bicheon gang (Bi meaning queen, Cheon meaning sky and heaven). Samuel doesn’t think they are as strong as Big Deal however. Jake, Jerry and Lineman mow down the men and arrive at Vivi’s room.
