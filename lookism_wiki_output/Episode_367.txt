Summary
Daniel, Zack and Vasco enter the building looking for Jiho. They find a Backdoor member who says Jiho is waiting for Daniel at the place, and he wants Daniel to come as himself and not James Lee. Zack is confused and wants to come with Daniel, but Daniel says he must go alone. He goes home and dresses in his uniform in his original body.
DG is fighting Taesoo, who doesn't recognize him. Hudson wakes up and is surprised with how quiet and calculating DG is during battle. Hudson starts crying seeing his idol lose, and Taesoo remembers his loss to DG. DG leans over Taesoo and says even though he lost, he is still cool. Taesoo recognizes DG and breaks down, flinging at him wildly with both fists. Hudson and DG are shocked to see Taesoo break his own rule of only using his right fist.
