Gun Park
(박종건 Park Jong Geon)
is a major antagonist in
Lookism
. He is a fighter of legendary status and the former personal bodyguard of the HNH Chairman's daughter,
Crystal Choi
. He was also one of the "10 Geniuses" raised by
Charles Choi
, as well as being the heir to the
Yamazaki Syndicate
in Japan, earning the title of White Ghost.
Ryu Seung-gon
voices Gun in the
Lookism
animated series.
Kent Itō

Lookism
mobile game.
Appearance
Gun is a very tall and lean-yet-muscular young man who is always dressed well, usually donning colors of dark fashion and designer brands. His hair is shaved on the sides but long on top, and has always been seen with it slicked back.
He is usually seen wearing full-rimmed glasses to hide the scar stretching between his eyes. Gun's facial appearance changes drastically when he takes off his glasses. He has many scars across his body, and tattoos on his arms. On his chest is a long, horizontal scar given by Eli Jang.

He also has a scar given by Jerry Kwon.

Gun's most distinguishing trait is his pitch black eyes with white irises, a result of him being constantly in the state of Ultra Instinct.
Personality
Gun is usually seen as a highly composed individual who is quite dedicated to his job as a bodyguard. He maintains a stern-looking expression on his face that exhibits a smile only when amused, usually by someone's fighting potential. This was most likely picked up from
Tom Lee
, who raised/trained him throughout his childhood, like his partner and rival
Goo Kim
, he is merciless when agitated and fighting—as seen during his fight with
Jake
. Gun stated he would knock out all of Jake's teeth, which he indeed ending up doing without much trouble. Unlike
Goo
Kim, Gun will remove his glasses when he's about to exhibit his demonic side, causing many to refer to him as a 'Monster'.
Gun is stated to be a "pervert" with whom gender is of no concern for his attraction by Goo. The nebulous nature of Goo's statement could refer to literal sexual attraction or a more idiosyncratic "attraction" to strong fighters.
Educational ability
Gun is both an exceptional fighter and a top-tier coach, earning him the title of "Nurture Genius". He is able to turn talentless fighters such as Olly Wang and Eli Jang into monstrous fighters in a short period of time, showcasing his educational ability. He also trained Daniel Park for one month, allowing him to completely overwhelm the Workers and prevent the destruction of Big Deal street.
Fighting Prowess
See article:
Ultra Instinct
Gun has been shown consistently since the beginning to be one of the strongest characters throughout the series, and even across the entire PTJ verse. He has mastered various martial arts and skillfully integrates all of them into his all-out fighting style. His most commonly used attacks come from Yamazaki-Style Kyoukushin Karate (a collection of Kyoukushin Karate arts from all across Japan). He prefers to fight unarmed (though he is adept in using weapons such as Tonfas and Stun Batons), and tank blows head on rather than dodging them.
As stated by Charles Choi, his strength is "impossible to capture", and he is a Genius who would never stop growing stronger. This is due to the fact that he is always conscious in the Ultra Instinct state, allowing him to amp his senses and physical capabilities to the max every second, making him stronger than ever after every successive fight.
He was able to tank a constant onslaught of attacks from Jerry Kwon, Warren Chae, Zack Lee and Vasco- all at their strongest, and then knock em all out near-effortlessly with little to no damage sustained.
In the earlier part of Lookism, he triumphs over the entirety of the
2nd Generation
with his strength, as none of them had been able to damage Gun seriously. This was so until the 2nd Generation got stronger.
In the Hunt For Big Deal arc, his mere presence alone was able to paralyze the majority of the Workers in fear. He then proceeds to defeat
Mandeok Bang
,
Yuseong
,
Ryuhei
and
Magami Kenta
all alone, sustaining no damage.
Later in the Hunt For Gun arc, he fought off thousands of Workers and Kagiroi with no damage, and later the Four Major Crews and their strongest fighters such as
Jake Kim
, Eli Jang, Johan Seong and Mandeok Bang. Though sustaining a broken arm, deep lacerations on his torso, with his chest caved in, one eye rendered functionally useless and pummeled into a crater on the ground, he was still able to overwhelm all of them.
When adrenaline pumps through Gun's blood, he becomes stronger than ever. It makes him unable to feel pain- allowing him to use a completely broken arm as if it were never destroyed in the first place. While fighting Johan Seong who regained his vision, he was able to tank all blows inspite of getting injured from previous fights from the crew heads.
And while fighting Goo Kim, even though getting pushed back and being on the defensive, he was still able to contend with the Weapon Genius until Charles Choi's safety was compromised by James Lee, at which point his attention wavers and Goo inflicts a deep slash on his neck, which could fell any other man. Which is another testament to his blatantly superhuman endurance and will to fight.
Eventually, due to losing consciousness, Gun's body enters the unbridled 'Ultra Instinct' state, something which is implied by both Goo's and James Lee's statements, to in fact be his true nature by blood. In this form, Gun's prowess ascends to such a level that he outright outmaneuvers and overpowers even a fighter of Goo's calibre into a knockout, even when the latter had already unleashed his own full power using his 'Twin Swords Stance' and got more serious than he's ever been for a fight.
Gun being the 'Nurture Genius', also mean that he sees martial arts and fighting as a whole like an academic subject. Hence he's also privy to their tactics, strategies and weaknesses as well, especially of his students. He is in fact so knowledgeable and intuitive about all things combat, that even after being at the most weakest and physically mangled state he's ever shown to be in whilst simultaneously overwhelmed by the pain of all the injuries he incurred throughout the arc, he still tactfully overpowers 2nd Body Daniel Park, whilst the latter is in Ultra Instinct himself, capitalizing on the latter's tendency to match opponents, and eventually pummel him into total inactivity, the first person in the series to achieve such a colossal feat, though that last effort took everything out of him and left him near death.
All of this truly cements him as one of the absolute most powerful and complete, hand-to-hand fighting forces ever seen, and will be as such for the far future.

Gun is half Japanese and half Korean according to PTJ himself.
Gun's father
is the Oyabun (Partriarch) of Yamazaki Clan, which makes him pure Japanese. Meaning Gun's mother is actually Korean.
Gun is not 20+ like many think. In
Episode 38
he is stated to be the same age as the seniors (who are 18-19), and one year has passed since then meaning he is now 19-20. He is more likely to be 19, however, Goo stated he would be unemployed when he turned 20,
[

]
so the same is likely for Gun.
It is revealed in the Shiro Oni arc (Gun's past arc) that he was actually born with Ultra Instinct
In chapter 501, Gun has been shown to have a hobby for carving wood at his residence, which is a Junkyard. The reason for this is unkown.
It has been confirmed by Charles Choi himself in the
Cheonliang
and Hunt for Gun arc, that
Gun's father
indeed was the Great Power the
Fist Gang
fought against, even admitting that the red paper holds the proof of his betrayal and his siding with the
Yamazaki Clan
.
According to Charles himself, Gun is a being which cannot be measured, even admitting that he is a genius and a son of a legend
(Gun's father
), his Genius as a training genius just goes on to show that he himself keeps growing as he trains people.
Gun is a regular smoker but till date hasn't done it in front of women or Goo (after he complained about the smoke in
Jake Kim arc
).
