Synopsis
Episode 360
The girls working at James Lee crew's bar come to
Jiho
to complain about the work. The bar manager bursts in and apologizes for their behavior, swearing he will teach them better. Jiho asks how many of the girls are complaining, and pulls out one tooth for each girl. They beg him to stop and say they will stop complaining about the work.
Daniel
comes to
Jace
to ask about the James Lee crew, and he tells them that he wanted to pay them back for messing with the
Burn Knuckles
. Jace says he didn't tell
Vasco
because he is obsessed with beating bad guys, so Jace will do it instead. He tells the gang that
Ansan
is running a private bar in Gangbuk where only verified customers can enter, and they used underaged girls from the runaway fams to run these bars.
Daniel goes undercover in Gangdong with
Eli
and pretend to be runaway kids. It isn't long before they are approached by
Jacky.
Zack
and Jace are pretending to be customers at a bar to get information on the illegal bar. Zack asks the girl next to him how old she is. When she says her age, Zack tells her to go get the head of the bar. Jace is excited that they will be getting more information, but Zack punches the manager and says they will take over Gangbuk like the other gangs. Jace hopes Daniel and Eli are doing better, but Eli has decided to pick a fight with Jacky.
Episode 361
Daniel
breaks them up and apologizes for
Eli's
short temper, saying they get messed with a lot as runaways.
Jacky
decides to take Daniel for an interview, and Daniel tells Eli to stay behind and cool down a bit.
Zack
beats up all the gangsters to
Jace's
surprise. They interrogate one of the bar workers and he says they don't know about the James Lee crew, only that high schoolers have been taking over bars.
Channing
enters and is surprised they beat everyone, and he asks if they want to work with them. Zack punches him and discovers Channing is a kickboxer. Channing says he will only use one hand to fight, and Zack thinks he is going to use his feet when his guard is down. Channing however uses a tattoo gun to slash Zack across the chest. Zack loses to Channing, and Jace tries to attack him but he is knocked to the ground as well.
Jacky takes Daniel to the crew's base for an interview. He knocks on the door and gets no response. When he enters,
Darius
in yoga pants doing pilates. He crawls on the ground asking for Daniel to take off his clothes, and Daniel slams the door and apologizes internally to Jace for not being able to do the interview.
Eli decides to go to the base anyway, and
DG
rolls up to tell him not to. Eli refuses, and DG asks if he wants to get in trouble.
Episode 362
Eli
smashes
DG's
helmet and tries to stab him with one of the shards. DG dodges and tells Eli he isn't looking for a fight. He whispers something to him and Eli wonders what to do.
Zack
wakes up in despair that he could not protect anyone. He sees Vasco standing over him, holding the couple's tracker. He is staring at
Jace
, who
Channing
tattoed
Ansan's
name on after stripping him to his boxers. Vasco cries tears of blood, and he remembers Jace saying extreme anger can lead to a person doing that.
Darius
sits
Daniel
on his lap for the interview and makes him feel uncomfortable with his handsiness. Daniel stands up and asks where to see the boss instead, and Darius reveals he knows who Daniel is, and that his gang had prepared for them. Daniel punches Darius and rushes to the door, but
Hudson
appears and punches him back. He asks if Hudson is from Ansan, and he admits it. Hudson's punches are powerful enough to create holes in the wall. Daniel thinks it is kyoukoshin karate, but Hudson says it is just training. With Daniel cornered, he starts whaling on him, preparing to use his right fist. Daniel hits Hudson back and steps on Darius's face to launch a kick, but Darius grabs his ankle and Hudson punches him in the stomach. Daniel is incapacitated, and Hudson leaves Darius to do what he wants to Daniel's body. He strips to his boxers and prepares to assault Daniel but Daniel gets up and punches him in the nuts.
Samuel
explains elsewhere that the heated mode that arises during fighting is caused by inferior emotions that escalate into madness.
Episode 363
Jiho
asks
Hudson
what took him so long, and he mentions having left
Daniel
to
Darius
. He also says
the King
will be approaching soon, his senior. A crew member bursts in to say Daniel is loose and attacking the second floor.
Jacky
is leaving the girls' dorm when he runs into
Zack
, looking for
Channing
. He tells Zack to not be a sorry loser and Zack decides to fight him, saying he never lost.
Warren
learns from
Max
and
Derrick
that the reason they lost is that they underestimated Jacky. He is incredibly fast and flexible, as well as powerful. Jacky tells Zack that despite being a lower rank than Channing, he is more powerful than he is.
He kicks Zack into a car and Zack wonders aloud how he could lose this easily to these gangsters when he was doing so well against
Mandeok
. Jacky tells him he isn’t talented, and he should try something other than fighting. Zack is triggered and grabs Jacky, slamming him into a car. Jacky tries to escape but he is trapped within the metal folds Zack caused when he slammed him in there. Zack starts punching him in the face as Jacky begs for mercy before he passes out. Zack is satisfied he lost against someone stronger than Channing.
Vasco
comes to the location that was tattooed on
Jace’s
body. Channing asks him if he is scared of needles, and Vasco tells him to not bother him since he is going to die soon.
Episode 364
As
Daniel
is fighting
Hudson
, Hudson recalls his call with
his senior
. He told the guy that
James Lee
may arrive in Seoul to squash the people using his name. His senior tells him not to use that name in vain, and Hudson says he is not joking. Daniel continues to slash Hudson in real time, and he says that the King of Ansan is coming, and he can’t let him see this mess. He rips off his shirt.
Channing
remembers when he used to bully people in school, tormenting his victims out of boredom. He tells
Vasco
he wants to be remembered forever as well, and slashes him with his tattoo gun. He mocks Vasco for playing crew with the
Burn Knuckles
, who are scrubs. Vasco says that he knows this, and it doesn’t matter because he will fight on their behalf. He said the same thing to the Burn Knuckles before, and
Jake
acknowledges this side of Vasco to
Lineman.
He punches Channing in the face, breaking the ground underneath him. Channing is stunned by the blow, and pulls out some more needles but Vasco keeps beating him. He wails that he was recognized by
Gun
and
Goo
three years ago, and Vasco uses
Brekdak’s
fifth forbidden move, and then a compressed low kick (his third forbidden move). Channing’s legs are crippled and Vasco tries to turn himself in, but the cop refuses.
Ethan
carries
Darius
out of the building so he and the other
Backdoor
members can guard the entrance of the hideout.
DG
arrives and asks who is using his name. Darius orders Backdoor to capture DG, and he decides fists will work better than words.
Episode 365
Darius is asked what his dream guy would be like, and he says a strong man. When asked about DG he says it isn't possible to feel lust for a god. DG complains that he isn't as strong as he used to be, and leaves after beating up everyone.
Daniel and Hudson are exchanging blows. Hudson grabs his left arm to punch Daniel but he kicks him away. Hudson has a flashback to his master at a bonfire. The king of Ansan says that he will be giving the crew to Hudson, who will be the sun of Ansan. He offers him a roasted python and Hudson accepts his position. Hudson tries to motivate himself against Daniel but he is struggling because Daniel is copying his moves. Daniel kicks Hudson out of a window and slams his face into the ground as they fall. He tells Hudson to return as friends in the future.
Daniel then sees a guy walking towards him. He asks if he is the King of Ansan. DG is also walking in that direction when he notices something.
Episode 366
The guy ignores Daniel and walks to Hudson, saying he did well and it's okay he lost. He ignores Daniel a second time and says he isn't interested in the second generation, but he came for James Lee. Daniel asks if the guy is willing to lose again, and he gets irritated.
Tom Lee narrates that there were many powerful leaders of the first generation, one of them being Taesoo Ma, king of Ansan who Daniel is currently fighting. Taesoo has the trademark of only fighting with his right fist. He is very powerful, damaging Daniel's arm and stopping his reverse kick.
Taesoo recalls his past when he fought with James Lee and lost. James acknowledged Taesoo but said it was time for the first generation of fighters to end. Since Taesoo would never stop fighting, he decided to cut his finger off. Taesoo pleaded with him to take his right eye instead. Since then, Taesoo has wanted revenge against DG, and to do the same to him.
Daniel gets back up and says he will show Taesoo how powerful the second generation can be. Vasco uses Brekdak's skill No.5 on Taesoo, and Zack punches him with chains in his hands. Taesoo is pleased with them all and tells them to come at him. Then DG comes flying from the building to kick Taesoo. He tells Daniel to go inside since there is someone waiting for him.
Episode 367
Daniel, Zack and Vasco enter the building looking for Jiho. They find a Backdoor member who says Jiho is waiting for Daniel at the place, and he wants Daniel to come as himself and not James Lee. Zack is confused and wants to come with Daniel, but Daniel says he must go alone. He goes home and dresses in his uniform in his original body.
DG is fighting Taesoo, who doesn't recognize him. Hudson wakes up and is surprised with how quiet and calculating DG is during battle. Hudson starts crying seeing his idol lose, and Taesoo remembers his loss to DG. DG leans over Taesoo and says even though he lost, he is still cool. Taesoo recognizes DG and breaks down, flinging at him wildly with both fists. Hudson and DG are shocked to see Taesoo break his own rule of only using his right fist.
Episode 368
Ever since Taesoo lost to DG, he has been training his left fist for revenge. Even though he abandoned his principle, it didn't matter if he could kill DG. Now his fist reaches DG. Hudson is shocked to see James Lee threatened by Taesoo and dodging his powerful punches. DG however tells Taesoo that he's gotten weaker, and he kicks him to the ground. Taesoo recalls DG telling him after their first fight that the reason he was so powerful was the faith he had in himself. By giving up on his values, Taesoo is weaker in DG's perspective.
Hudson sees his idol crumbling before him and starts crying. DG tells Taesoo not to bother him, and he says that it doesn't matter. The first generation know that James Lee exists, and they will come after him for their own reasons. DG says it wouldn't be a problem since the second generation isn't made of pushovers.
Daniel confronts Jiho at the convenience store and asks him if he still pretends to smoke. Jiho asks how Daniel knew the location, and he says this was the first place the two of them fought. He then tells Daniel that he asked him to come like this because he has two bodies.
Episode 369
Darius visited Jiho in prison before he left and reported what he found out about Daniel. He couldn't find any information about his family except that they lived abroad. His friend just slept the entire day. Looking into his school files he found that the fat Daniel was on the school record. Jiho asks Darius if he has ever seen the two of them together.
Back at the convenience store Jiho reassures Daniel he hasn't told anyone the truth about his identity. He asks Daniel to give him the secret of the two bodies, but Daniel refuses and tells him to turn himself in. Jiho smashes Daniel into the window and says that he should understand the most how he feels. He slams his head into the ground and tries to choke Daniel with a string but he escapes. Jiho sticks a wine opener in his chest and twists it before slashing Daniel. Jiho stands over Daniel and says they are the same person, but Daniel just got lucky.
Daniel has a flashback to a meeting with Duke. His fans came into the room and Daniel mistakenly greeted them before they asked Duke for a picture. In real time, Daniel punches Jiho into a convenience machine and tells him to stop blaming his appearance for his failures, because people can change. Jiho tells Daniel he can't change, and Wally stabs Daniel in the back but Daniel removes the knife and throws him away. Daniel then starts beating Jiho with systema. Jiho begs for Daniel to forgive him and give him another chance. Daniel helps him up before elbowing him in the head, saying that Jiho doesn't get another chance.
