It's not strong and not a problem. The guy who walks his own path is different. The guys standing on the road are different.

Copy is not invincible.
I can't copy the things I gained by polishing my own way, such as Gun Park's body and my gift.
That's why the pinnacle of a generation has been the pinnacle of Gapryong Kim and Lee Ji Hoon.

“
It is different from the state.
Your own way
is literally a special one that can only walk.
Unlike the state that anyone can cross, no one can realize his own way.

Path
is a unique ability that, according to
Gun Park
, is distinguished from
Mastery
because it is something unique to the individual that no one else can attain and that arises as a manifestation of their own abilities and convictions. To awaken their own Path, the individual must reach a state of understanding and unwavering determination in what they believe as proof of their individuality and thus achieve unparalleled power.
The main difference between Mastery and Path is that Mastery users acquire a superhuman physical attribute that manifests itself in the emanation of an aura and a glow in the eyes of a specific color, while Path is the awakening of a unique ability that is associated with a pure white aura emanating from the user's entire body and their eyes.
