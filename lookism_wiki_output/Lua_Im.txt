—Luah Lim  in
episode TBA
Luah
Lim
is a member of
Big Deal
.
Appearance
Luah Lim is a slender girl with fair skin and long hair. Her hair is straight and falls to her mid-back. It is mostly soft black in colour, with the underside of it and a few strands being paler. A section of her bangs on her left side, in particular, consists of these pale strands.
Her features are proportionate and in accordance with the golden ratio. She has an oval face that narrows into a pointed chin, and large eyes that are a luminous purplish-brown. They are ringed by black lashes, and above them are her eyebrows, which are straight and dark.
Personality
Capable and well-informed, Luah Lim is a valued member of
Big Deal
for her intelligence gathering. She is skilled at what she does, having been the principle cause behind
Gun
's praise of the gang's ability to collect information. She also possesses the capacity to apply the knowledge which she gleans to real-world scenarios, correctly identifying
Johan Seong
from little more than his "baby face"
[
1
]
and "aura of strength."
However, Luah demonstrates a certain degree of impulsive behavior. She physically intervenes to save
Eden
despite lacking the power to effectively fight off the dog's tormentors
[

]
, and flings Johan's phone into a body of water to prevent him from answering a call from the
White Tiger Job Centre
[

]
. Both of these actions serve to reveal other aspects of her personality as well. By endeavoring to rescue Eden, she proves that she is a compassionate individual; and her throwing Johan's phone so recklessly speaks to her loyalty to Big Deal, having been instructed by
Jason Yoon
to "do whatever it takes to stop Johan from taking White Tiger's call
[
4
]
.
Luah has described herself as a "romantic"
[
5
]
and has been similarly characterized as such by Jason and Jake. She is devoted to the street which Big Deal protects, and will accomplish whatever task she must to ensure its continued safety. Due to these specific traits of hers, the idea that Luah is "like a female version of Sinu Han"
[
6
]
has been expressed.
Relationships
Big Deal
Jake Kim
Jake Kim, being the head of Big Deal, is Luah's leader. He is protective of her, perhaps overly so; for in his protection of her, he fails to consider what she wants. Jake orders Luah to leave prior to the war between
Big Deal
and
Workers
[

]
without even informing her of his plan, though she had voiced open concern at his supposed lack of one on multiple occasions.
Luah herself appears to regard and interact with Jake almost as she would an equal, vocalizing her intention to sit on him and the four other members of Big Deal whose ranks precede hers as punishment for not realizing she would arrive in Gangbuk instead of Gangseo, and for him not subsequently travelling to Gangbuk with those members to collect her
