Xiaolung is her body guard but he also has a "God" complex with her. He almost worships her and will do absolutely anything to protect her. He has stated before that she is an "Angel" for him. Vivi's Father forced him as a child to be her protector and since he had no one and really just was an orphan, he really didn't have a choice in the matter.

Synopsis
History
When Vivi was young she met Xiaolung and gave him his name, this makes Xiaolung fall in love with her. Once she's older, she gets attacked, by the people who are meant to protect her because of her ignorant, rude behaviour towards them. But then Xiaolung comes and saves her, this is probably the moment she started to develop feelings for him. He then becomes her bodyguard because of the incident. Once she's in high school she confesses her feelings for Xiaolung but he rejects her because he has sworn to be her bodyguard and nothing else, even though he does return those feeling, although he does not explain that to her.
She goes to Korea so that she can less conspicuously do drugs, due to the fact that she's an addict, because in China you can get executed for doing drugs, and since she is a multi-billionaire's daughter it can also cause  large media commotion. Another reason she goes to Korea is to become a part of the third affiliate, along with her several bodyguards, who have sworn to protect her.
Once Xiaolung gets severely hurt she shows a clear compassion for her love for him by running over to him and comforting him in her arms. After that they move back to China and start living in an unknown forest of bamboos in a little hut, dedicating that she will do everything that he did for her, due to the fact that he can no longer walk, and that she will stop doing drugs. After that he requests her to get him a blanket so she runs to the hut to get one but when she returns he's not there because her father did not approve of the relationship. But only told her that he was dead so she wouldn't persist. Xiaolung knew this and accepted the fact that their love could never work and left, with his master. Vivi is left heartbroken.
