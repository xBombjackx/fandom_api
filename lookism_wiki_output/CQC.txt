CQC(Close-Quarter-Combat) is a highly sophisticated military martial arts technique, pioneered by the South Korean Military,  which involves attacking the opponent's vital spots in a repeated fashion, as long as the opponent is within the user's radius of attack.
Many
copycats
and characters from the Manager Kim spinoff webtoon also utilise this technique.
Explanation
This is a martial technique used by the military to neutralize threats within a radius of up to 100 feet (about 30 meters).
Within Webtoon, CQC is widely used thanks to its precision and range of techniques.
