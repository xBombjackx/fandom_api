Relationships
Justin and Chuck were tested by Big Deal's No. 1 Jake Kim, who dictated that the duo's dirty tactics were not suited for Big Deal. Soon after, the two were taken under the wing of Hostel A Olly Wang, who took a liking to their unethical and desperate need to survive. The duo served Olly as right-hand men up to the day of his passing.
