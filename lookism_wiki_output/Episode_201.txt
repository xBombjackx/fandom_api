Summary
Ivan lunges at Vin but misses him. He tries to spin land but is caught by Vin, who floors him. Ivan removes his clothes to reveal a wrestling uniform, and Mary is thankful she turned out the lights.
Jace
finds Damon in an alley and Damon tells him to spare his yellow duck, which Jace promptly chucks in the air. He runs into Mark Sa of the God Dogs and wonders what to do, since Vasco isn't responding to his calls.
Logan is at a karaoke place with the animation department when he notices a body pillow that resembles Zoe. He punches it in a rage and begins to cry about his heartbreak, but eventually warms up to the pillow. As he is carrying it back to the room he is stopped by Hope Park, who smashes him into the room. The animation department is stunned to see Logan laying on the ground.
